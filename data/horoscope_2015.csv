SIGN,DATE,TEXT
aries,2015-01-01,"You Rams excel at initiating new activities rather than finishing them, making this your kind of day. You look forward to the future with great anticipation, especially since an optimistic Jupiter-Mars opposition gives you an energetic boost. Although so much cosmic encouragement makes it difficult to cut back your busy schedule, be careful that you don't exhaust yourself. Fortunately, with just a little bit of forethought, you can still have a fantastic time while pacing yourself for the long haul."
taurus,2015-01-01,"Your potential to accomplish a lot around your home is great today, but you're not interested in the stress that too much activity brings. You might even wish you could retreat into your shell and let all the noise pass you by. Nevertheless, the holiday celebrations may be hard to ignore. Even if your dreamy day of solitude doesn't materialize, you can still find time to relax. Although the planets inspire you to act boldly, make sure to reserve some energy and resources for the days ahead."
gemini,2015-01-01,"Finding balance in your life can be tricky because your current tendency is to push your limits too far. You want to squeeze the most out of every minute of the day and are not willing to accept anything less. One problem with this kind of extreme thinking is that you could set yourself up for a big disappointment. Instead of looking at each event as an all-or-nothing proposition, remind yourself to keep things in proper perspective. Accepting reality as it is frees you from having to turn every moment into an extraordinary experience. Finding joy in the simple things makes your heart happy."
cancer,2015-01-01,"Although your first impulse may be to decline an invitation today, hanging out with supportive friends is healthy for your self-esteem. Sharing in the fun with your favorite people is heartwarming, but there's no need to overindulge with food, drink or gifts. Concerns about your finances might seem far away for the moment, but finding pleasure is not dependent on spending money. Surrounding yourself with loved ones is a surefire way to recharge your soul."
leo,2015-01-01,"Your I-can-do-it attitude is currently on overdrive, making nearly everything sound possible. But this isn't a great time for speculation, especially if the outcome looks too good to be true. You aren't usually one to let the random ideas of others pull you too far off your planned course of action. Nevertheless, you may need to do a bit of back-pedaling in the days ahead unless you exercise caution now. Explore all options with an open mind today, but do your homework before saying yes."
virgo,2015-01-01,"Too much and too fast are not your style. You prefer to reduce complex situations into manageable pieces through logical analysis. However, you could overreact today and fall into obsessively worrying about the wrong things. No matter how challenging it is to believe that the outcome can match your idealistic expectations, forget about being rational for once and take a risk. You'll never know what could happen unless you spread your wings and fly."
libra,2015-01-01,"Relationships have recently shown you a path of personal growth that is pushing you beyond your old comfort zone. Life is exhilarating today because the horizons of your social world are broadening and exposing you to new experiences. However, the uncertainty of the unknown doesn't make you feel safe. Nevertheless, it's not time to pull back out of fear. Imagine how you could interact with loved ones if you actually believed that anything is possible. Now, act in according with this new vision and see what the future brings."
scorpio,2015-01-01,"Maintaining stability in your relationships keeps you on your toes now. Your feelings are soaring and then something happens to bring them crashing back down to earth. It isn't fun to vacillate between such extremes. However, you can see the absolute best in any situation today and yet still maintain a realistic perspective. Contemplate your future goals without feeling obligated to make any lasting decisions. Extending your imagination into the unobstructed blue sky is a breathtaking experience if you're willing to keep your heart open, no matter what."
sagittarius,2015-01-01,"Ripples of excitement build into waves of anticipation with the new year stretching out in front of you like an uncharted ocean. You're ready to set sail, eager to engage your future while courageous Mars heats up adventurous Jupiter. But no matter how amazing everything appears, it's time for a reality check; if it's overdue, there could be some disappointment on the horizon. However, if you have paid attention to the facts along the way, you could be very close to reaching an important goal. Keep your eye on the prize and your shoulder to the wheel."
capricorn,2015-01-01,"Your sense of who you are or what you have to offer others may be overblown now, but this distortion isn't necessarily a bad thing. In fact, your heightened self-esteem might be the catalyst that finally motivates you to take a calculated risk in a relationship. Ask for what you need; whatever you want is reasonable as long as you aren't too greedy. Just be sure to generously give back in return to make this a fair trade."
aquarius,2015-01-01,"You are running on a full tank of gas today, but oddly enough, you're burning through your fuel faster than ever. Your confidence is so high that you could overestimate your resources or you might even think your friends and relatives possess superpowers. However, this inflated view can lead you down a path to disillusionment when you realize the limitations of being human. Reel in your blind optimism while you still can; life is awesome enough without embellishing it further."
pisces,2015-01-01,"Your happiness is integrally entwined with your productivity now, so you might find chores to do in order to increase your sense of satisfaction. Fortunately, you can talk yourself down from your high expectations; it's a holiday and it may not be convenient to undertake something you cannot finish. In fact, you could get more peace of mind from completing a minor task today than starting a major project. It's wonderful to feel so alive; just remember you don't have to push the edges of the envelope in order to have a fabulous day."
aries,2015-01-02,"You might be incredibly busy today, even if you don't get very much accomplished. You're more interested in pursuing a sparkly new person or a fresh idea than you are in finishing your work. Unfortunately, this kind of irresponsible attitude can stir up the ire of a coworker who wants you to hold up your end of the deal. Avoid causing unnecessary trouble now by fulfilling your promises before doing anything else. Exercising self-discipline early in the day gives you the chance to embark on an intellectual exploration later on."
taurus,2015-01-02,"You are torn between opposing forces today, yet due to a lack of resources you're limited in how you can respond. Accepting an intriguing invitation sounds tempting today, but previous obligations might not give you enough time. You would love to jump at a chance to make more money, but it may not materialize right away. Don't let discouragement bring you down; express your creativity knowing that your efforts will be acknowledged in the future. Keep plugging away for now; your opportunity to shine will come soon enough."
gemini,2015-01-02,"Having too many choices can be a bit overwhelming today, especially if you're trying to follow through on unfinished tasks that are left over from before the holidays. Nevertheless, the Moon's current visit to your inquisitive sign is exciting because you can't help but see wonderful opportunities everywhere you look. There's no reason to be too hard on yourself if you aren't able to concentrate on your work. Just make certain that you come back to it later so you don't let anyone down while you chase your dreams."
cancer,2015-01-02,"Taking defensive action by retreating behind a wall of secrecy won't necessarily make you feel any more secure today. The Moon is hiding out in your 12th House of Privacy, reinforcing your tendency to emotionally withdraw if circumstances become too confusing or intense. However, your smartest strategy is to talk about your concerns. Bringing your feelings out into the open now saves you from having to fall into your fantasies in order to feel safe. Surprisingly, reality could be better than your dreams."
leo,2015-01-02,"Although there may be pressure on you to follow through on your professional commitments, you prefer to be socializing with your friends or associates today. Unfortunately, you could easily forget to return to your chores if you choose to play in the middle of the day. Instead of avoiding responsibilities by jumping from one distraction to another, focus solely on one thing at a time. The company of others will seem more pleasurable when you can truly relax and enjoy it with a clear conscience."
virgo,2015-01-02,"You're at a fork in the road and have choices to make now that could significantly impact the trajectory of your career. You can see the pros and cons of both paths; nevertheless, you must choose based on what you know today, rather than what might happen in the future. Your dreams are inspirational, but it's wise to be practical and pay attention to the facts. Nevertheless, don't hesitate for long; trust your instincts to steer you in the right direction."
libra,2015-01-02,"Your current perspective is not limited by social convention now, yet stepping out of the box may lead you onto an unfamiliar path. Unfortunately, placing too much importance on your impractical ideas can be disorienting if you don't ground your radical plans with reality. However, it's better to give your mind permission to wander rather than attempting to stop your natural creative flow. Just remember that you don't have to act on every whim or share every thought. Exploring your imagination enables you to visit other worlds as you please."
scorpio,2015-01-02,"You may already have your schedule set in stone but you might have to adapt it to an unexpected change of circumstances, anyway. You won't likely change your mind easily, but your unwillingness to be flexible isn't helpful now. Having to relinquish your plans may seem like a setback, but it could be a true blessing in disguise. This is not about your failure to reach your goals; rather, it's a temporary break in your progress that allows you to recharge your batteries so your energy is there when you need it most."
sagittarius,2015-01-02,"Relationship dynamics are in the spotlight today and others might be the source of excitement or irritation, depending on the circumstances. More likely, someone is both pleasant and bothersome at the same time. Although you want to enjoy the company, it's difficult to stick to your agenda when other people keep pulling you off track. There isn't a simple solution to this dilemma, but being adaptable enables you to maintain a positive attitude. Your willingness to meet the opposition halfway opens the door to a whole new world of possibilities."
capricorn,2015-01-02,"You're uncertain about what's expected of you at work today. Even if you are assigned a specific task, there may be a variety of ways for you to tackle it. The dualistic Gemini Moon's visit to your 6th House of Details can weigh you down with minutiae or tie you up in red tape unless you keep your eyes on your goal. Ultimately, it's more effective to jump in and get busy than to endlessly analyze all the angles. The sooner you begin, the quicker you finish."
aquarius,2015-01-02,"You may be fighting a losing battle in your current war against change. It's ironic that you appear to be such a progressive person yet you cling to the status quo like a non-swimmer sticks to the shore. Thankfully, you have recently processed some pretty big lessons about the intuitive power of your strong imagination. Tuning into your dreams can play a significant role in your current drama of transformation."
pisces,2015-01-02,"You may believe that you can give up an old habit now by simply reaffirming your resolution to do so. Although stating your intention is a crucial part of the process, words alone won't do the trick. You must actually alter your behavior to set the new pattern in motion. You're on the threshold of a significant transition, and you might foolishly attempt to make it happen all at once. But even if you experience a sudden breakthrough today, the most enduring changes unfold gradually. Perhaps you feel a sense of urgency, but there's really no hurry at all."
aries,2015-01-03,"You feel as if you're a salmon swimming upstream in a storm today as the currents of circumstance hinder your progress. Although you're quick to blame others for your predicament, the real struggle originates within you. You might act like an ostrich and bury your head in the sand, pretending that you don't see what's happening. But as you know, denial won't solve anything -- nor will you be able to maintain this posture for long. Instead, be ruthless as you drag your fears out into the light of day. Self-awareness is the key to positive change."
taurus,2015-01-03,"Your thoughts may seem out of your control as they take you for an intense trip through your fears today. Thankfully, you can come out the other side with a complete change of heart. Although this metaphysical journey isn't light and breezy since it doesn't offer any guarantee of success, it will be exciting, nonetheless. There's no reason to succumb to negativity or doubt. Take time to assess your strengths and weaknesses so you can prepare for the future with an open mind and a sustainable plan."
gemini,2015-01-03,"The most beautiful emotional treasures are hidden deep under the apparent calm today. Typically, your curiosity motivates you to quickly move on to what's next, but now an irrepressible compulsion to understand your feelings inspires you to explore beneath the surface. However, you may become so obsessed with the potential rewards that you reach too far. Lighten up; the current situation will continue to evolve at a healthy pace once you realize you don't have to push so hard."
cancer,2015-01-03,"You are giving birth to a whole new way of relating to friends and family now, but this emotional process comes with its own share of stress. In order to reinvent yourself you may need to confront someone's control issues, especially if your recent growth spurt appears to threaten the status quo. However, you might be the one who is stuck -- and you don't appreciate anyone meddling in your affairs. There's no need to hold onto the past now; it's slipping away from you whether you like it or not. The only constant you can count on is change."
leo,2015-01-03,"You're ready to blast ahead with your plans today, even if you are receiving mixed signals from everyone else involved. Unfortunately, pushing your agenda won't likely work out in your favor now. You could inadvertently rekindle an unnecessary emotional conflict while blindly speeding toward your goals. Nevertheless, don't be afraid of proceeding on your own if your friends don't share your current passion. Express your fierce independence by being willing to stand out in a crowd."
virgo,2015-01-03,"You're overly concerned with making the disparate pieces fit perfectly now, leading you to plan more than is necessary. Unfortunately, getting lost in the minutiae spoils the fun by taking the spontaneity out of the day. Avoid getting swept up in an unnecessary power struggle, even if you're positive that your solution is the best one. Ease the pressure on current circumstances by consciously choosing acceptance over fear. Stepping away from a direct confrontation creates enough space for the spark of creativity to grow into the fire of self-expression."
libra,2015-01-03,"Someone's unexpressed feelings might rock your boat today, even if you desperately try to hold steady. Unfortunately, the hidden price of keeping the peace is higher than you realize since jealousy can generate anger and resentment. The potentially negative energy is tricky to control because sharing may be as problematic as keeping quiet. It's healthy to talk about your fears, but don't alienate anyone with unnecessary emotional intensity. Negotiate a workable compromise by stating your case as objectively as possible and then encouraging others to do the same."
scorpio,2015-01-03,"There's so much on your plate that you may be secretly tempted to run and hide. Nevertheless, the adrenaline has kicked in and you're committed to do whatever it takes to cross some tasks off your list. Unfortunately, you might disagree with someone who has a radically different idea of how you should spend your time. Today's Sun-Pluto conjunction can turn every interaction into a major drama. Processing your emotions before you respond allows you to maintain control of the flow of events. You are a force to be reckoned with now so channel your intensity into your work."
sagittarius,2015-01-03,"You are driven to succeed today, but it's helpful to acknowledge that honoring your core values is more important than achieving material satisfaction. You might reconsider a recent decision and want to modify your behavior, but this sudden turn can be complicated if you're already in motion. You didn't get to this point overnight, and you won't be able to change direction in a moment's notice, either. Fortunately, there's no need to panic, so take your time and carefully map out your strategy. You still need a song in mind if you want to march to your own drummer."
capricorn,2015-01-03,"Even the most minor issues can quickly blow out of proportion as tempers flare and passions erupt. Today's Sun-Pluto hookup occurs in your sign, making you more susceptible to the emotional intensity in the air. You might be obsessing about determining your plans for the future and you're not willing to take no for an answer. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently invite resistance if you come on too strong. A gentle and persistent approach is more productive than overpowering anyone else with your powerful resolve. The art of persuasion takes a light touch."
aquarius,2015-01-03,"You're living in a dreamworld if you think you can stay on schedule today. Others can't help but notice the sparkle in your eyes and the spring in your step now that captivating Venus is in your sign. However, your enthusiasm might be dampened if unexpected events require you to abandon your plans. Don't struggle to keep your agenda intact; just let it fall apart so you can put the pieces back together in a more creative manner. The process of starting something anew must begin with the ending of the previous cycle."
pisces,2015-01-03,"Your vivid visions of the future may run you ragged now, bringing thrills one minute and concerns the next. However, you might realize that your plans are not unfolding as expected today. Rather than accepting defeat, try to see this as a rare opportunity to reinvent yourself in harmony with your hopes and dreams. Let go of past goals that no longer hold any meaning and forget about conforming to other people's expectations. Set new priorities for your life and step boldly into the year ahead. Be true to yourself and don't look back."
aries,2015-01-04,"Your current dependency on others makes you feel uneasy since you usually take pride in your self-sufficiency. But today's nurturing Cancer Full Moon lands in your 4th House of Security, reminding you how much you need people in your life. You must find a way to balance your love of freedom with your desire for healthy relationships. Play out all the possibilities in the safety of your mind, but don't over-commit in haste just to get what you want in the moment. Your chosen path is not an easy one now, but practicing patience and trusting the process can lead to happiness."
taurus,2015-01-04,"The most trivial conversation today could suddenly turn into a discussion about your most significant aspirations in life. In fact, all subjects are fair game now with the Cancer Full Moon spotlighting your 3rd House of Communication. However, her opposition to the powerful Sun-Pluto combination in your 9th House of Big Ideas requires you to connect your current situation with your larger goals. Talking about your dreams is only a start; investing in sweat equity helps to assure your success."
gemini,2015-01-04,"Finances may present a problem now, unless you stop to handle a sticky situation before it grows out of hand. Fortunately, you can prevent a possible fiscal mess by cutting back on your expenses to bring them more into alignment with your current resources. The cautious Cancer Full Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Money indicates that a little prudence is wise at this time. Don't wait until it's too late; proactive behavior nips the problem in the bud and  brings you a healthy sense of self-empowerment."
cancer,2015-01-04,"You don't like it when someone is overly insistent; you can feel the pressure in your gut and it just makes you want to push back harder or withdraw into your shell. Your emotions are at high tide while today's powerful Full Moon floods your 1st House of Self. But others see through your veneer now even if you try to hide your annoyance. Ultimately, it takes less energy to establish clear boundaries by letting everyone know about your limits right from the start. There's no reason to deny your needs; show up exactly as you are and the respect will follow."
leo,2015-01-04,"Your imagination is in full bloom now and it's nearly impossible to keep your colorful fantasies from growing out of control. Although the Cancer Full Moon emphasizes your 12th House of Escapism, you can prevent losing touch with reality today by focusing on chores that have been left undone. Thankfully, it's not necessary to do everything at once, even if you are so inclined. Starting small makes the most sense while the Sun is hanging out in your 6th House of Details. Being practical is not as much fun as exploring your daydreams but you'll feel proud of your accomplishments by the end of the day."
virgo,2015-01-04,"You can create something of lasting value today, even if this is a day of rest. The Cancer Full Moon brightens your 11th House of Community, prompting you to enjoy the magic of a spontaneous moment with friends; all you need to do is give yourself permission to have fun. Supervising recreational activities with children may prove to be just as enjoyable for you as it is for them. Although you might think you should be doing more work, some days are emotionally fruitful in intangible ways you cannot measure."
libra,2015-01-04,"You're torn between taking care of your own personal needs and making sure that others are having a nice time. Of course, you Libras make the most gracious hosts and hostesses, but it might feel like the current situation is an either-or proposition, as if there isn't enough happiness to go around. The Cancer Full Moon in your public 10th House of Responsibility opposes the Capricorn Sun in your private 4th House of Foundations. You cannot play on both sides of the fence today just to avoid conflict. It's not your job to please everyone all the time; break free and follow your bliss."
scorpio,2015-01-04,"It really could be a lovely day in the neighborhood if you're willing to stick close to home today. You might just learn something enlightening about yourself or your loved ones by resisting the temptation to leave the nest while the Cancer Moon lights up your 9th House of Faraway Places. Surprisingly, you can make up for your lack of geographical variety by traveling within your imagination and still have an amazing time. Keep your eyes and ears open so that you don't miss the beauty all around you."
sagittarius,2015-01-04,"Handling criticism isn't easy for anyone, but it can be exceptionally tough on you Archers when your sunny optimism is cast in the shadows of doubt. The Cancer Full Moon shining in your 8th House of Deep Sharing reflects your uncharacteristic emotional intensity. You won't be satisfied today unless you schedule time to sink into the unknown watery realms. Thankfully, you don't have to take this journey alone. Accepting advice from others without letting it shake your confidence empowers you to make constructive changes and then get on with what's next."
capricorn,2015-01-04,"You have the capability to effectively tailor your actions to produce specific results today because you can intuitively feel the energy of others. Unfortunately, too much analysis now only gets in your way while the receptive Cancer Full Moon meanders through your 7th House of Relationships. Worrying about how others perceive you is stressful and it's unfeasible to think that you can control all the emotional variables at this time. Find a flow and just roll with it for a change."
aquarius,2015-01-04,"Although some of your craziest fantasies have practical applications now, it may require a fair amount of patience to figure out how best to realize your dreams. No matter how far out your imagination takes you today, the Cancer Full Moon's presence in your 6th House of Self-Improvement allows the thoughts to unfold without negative judgment. The best part of the plot is that you can pick and choose which ideas have the most potential for future manifestation. Happily, you are the writer, director and star of your own movie."
pisces,2015-01-04,"Turning the day into a spiritual retreat seems like an idea that's very close to your heart, yet you're afraid it might disappear with the flash of a frown if you discuss it with someone else. However, you might be quite surprised when your friend or partner responds with a smile and a twinkle in the eye instead of the negativity you expect. Luckily, the Cancer Full Moon fills your 5th House of Self-Expression with light, so take a risk and share your vision. Trust in your heart and let your imagination soar."
aries,2015-01-05,"A conflict between your head and your heart could drain some of your enthusiasm today. You know what's best for you, but you're pulled in another direction, nonetheless. You often make the smartest choices by spontaneously reacting to the current circumstances, but this time may be an exception. Self-restraint is rewarded; you're better off listening to logic than to your intuition now. Make a rational decision and put your choice into action only after you sort out the facts."
taurus,2015-01-05,Reevaluating your professional objectives makes perfect sense now that talkative Mercury makes his debut in your 10th House of Career. Sharing your aspirations with your colleagues can help to clear the path to success. But don't overstate your position or you may lose credibility with the very same people you want to impress. Sticking to the truth enables you to gain much-needed support. Offering an enlightened compromise at the right moment could provide immediate relief for everyone involved.
gemini,2015-01-05,"If you run into resistance from an authority figure today, the planetary energies are telling you something you need to know. At first, an unexpected obstacle might appear to prevent you from reaching your goals. But don't give up too soon because stern Saturn is just putting you through your paces to see if you really have your act together. Slow down and listen; you must figure out what you need to learn so you can pass this test with flying colors and move on."
cancer,2015-01-05,"If you are withholding anything from close friends or relatives, consider taking this opportunity to clear the air. Although the moody Moon's current visit to your sign might tempt you to remain quiet, other cosmic forces are encouraging you to share what's on your mind. Just don't turn your disclosure into a struggle for control; express your feelings without arguing about who is right and who is wrong. Taking full responsibility for your emotions relieves the pressure all the way around. It's time to be part of the solution and not the problem."
leo,2015-01-05,"Your ability to hide your feelings today may be the key to staying out of trouble. Even your craziest ideas sound completely normal to others because you intuitively know what to filter out of a conversation. Even if your fantasies take you on a wild goose chase, no one else will be the wiser because you appear to have your feet planted on solid ground. Paradoxically, the higher you fly in your mind, the more stable you seem. Dancing in your dreams is fine as long as the music that moves you can be heard on Earth."
virgo,2015-01-05,"Although you need to be around other people today -- friends or coworkers -- you wish you could run away when the energy becomes too intense. It may be nearly impossible to find an easy balance between your desire to enjoy the company of people and your wish to be alone. However, no one needs to know what's going on within the deep recesses of your imagination. You can still escape into your own magical world even in the midst of a crowd."
libra,2015-01-05,"Even if you're not usually over-protective of those you love, you are inclined to take care of everyone that comes into your sphere of influence now. Of course, you are naturally supportive, but the nurturing Cancer Moon prompts you to overextend your energy today. But be careful that you don't suppress negativity just so others will accept you. Your actions seem more sincere when they come from your heart."
scorpio,2015-01-05,"Sometimes taking a vacation sounds like a better idea than it is in reality. However, a sensibly planned trip may be fun now. There's no need to leave right away, but the sooner you begin considering all of your options, the sooner you can turn this dream into something real. If possible, include someone else in your little adventure, since the energy you receive from others at this time will only serve to fuel your enthusiasm and inspire you to make the magic happen at all costs."
sagittarius,2015-01-05,"Working in close proximity to someone may create annoying tension today. Paradoxically, it's not that you want to work alone; it's just that you prefer to reserve the right to withdraw on a moment's notice when you've had enough of other people's nonsense. Focusing on the most practical aspects of the job at hand will help you keep things in perspective if you start to lose patience. Setting clear priorities enables you to overcome your testy attitude and makes it a breeze to cooperate with your coworkers."
capricorn,2015-01-05,"This is a fantastic day to apply your determination toward your professional goals, even if someone seems to hesitate to support your activities. You have the ability to easily transform your ingenious thoughts into decisive actions; if you can think it through now then you can make it happen. Don't allow anyone's doubts to rain on your parade when you have the cosmic forces on your side. Let your ambitions soar; the only one that has to believe in you is you."
aquarius,2015-01-05,"You have been in a rather secretive mood recently and today is your chance to come clean. But even if you express what's in your heart, you still might not reveal everything. You can make it sound like you're more open-minded and forthright than you actually are. However, don't waste energy pretending you have nothing to hide because others will know if you're not being real. Total honesty is part of the deal when it comes to cultivating successful relationships."
pisces,2015-01-05,"Your intuition is running on overdrive now that three planets are moving through your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Although this instinctive method of perceiving the truth is often quite accurate, it can present unexpected problems today. You may have a tough time distinguishing your own feelings from those of people around you. Heightened sensitivity is useful, but only if you're able to see things clearly. Rely only on the facts that are right in front of you; your imagination will serve you well again tomorrow."
aries,2015-01-06,"You may grow bored with your work today unless you can figure out how to own your vision of the future. The lively Leo Moon activates your 5th House of Self-Expression, encouraging you to share your feelings, even if it means rattling some cages in the process. But putting your plan into motion might require more preparation than you want to invest. Don't let difficult odds stop you; creative thinking enables you to discover the best way to manifest a magical solution."
taurus,2015-01-06,"You might be so caught up in the details today that you can miss an opportunity for fun that's right in front of your nose. You have responsibilities to meet and you don't have the luxury of indulging in frivolous activities. Nevertheless, you can still enjoy yourself by making a simple shift of attitude. The playful Leo Moon inspires you to approach your work as if it were a game. This change of perspective infuses you with a competitive spirit, empowering you to overcome any obstacle standing between you and your goals."
gemini,2015-01-06,"Evasive tactics won't succeed today if someone doesn't support your plan to solve a problem. You might try to talk your way around the issue instead of confronting the difference of opinions directly. Unfortunately, avoidance isn't a very smart strategy since your lighthearted attitude can alienate the same people you want on your side. Just be straightforward right from the start, or you could end up being so clever that you outsmart yourself. A straight line is the shortest distance between two points."
cancer,2015-01-06,"You could be so obstinate when it comes to spending money today that you openly disagree with a caring friend who thinks you should be more frugal. Although this conflict may not be worth an argument, you still need to be careful about downplaying your feelings because you might grow irritated if you remain completely silent. Ultimately, it's best to say what's on your mind now and finish the conversation. Even if you must compromise in the end, it never hurts to think twice before making a big purchase."
leo,2015-01-06,"There is a dramatic shift in the cosmic energy that motivates you to let others know what you need today. It seems more natural than ever to share your feelings without worrying about the consequences. Nevertheless, you still might have to spend extra time in dialogue with those closest to you to help them understand your process. Don't be overly concerned if someone takes you to task due to his or her convictions. Acknowledging areas of conflict is not a problem as long as you go on to establish common ground."
virgo,2015-01-06,"You can thoroughly enjoy yourself today, even if there doesn't seem to be a lot of social activity in your corner of the world. The Leo Moon's visit to your 12th House of Spirituality allows you to find joy, even in the simplest of pleasures. You don't have to go out of your way to make something special happen. Grab a bit of well-deserved rest and relaxation now while you have the chance. No fretting is required; count your blessings, instead."
libra,2015-01-06,"Seeking out memorable experiences that can be shared with your friends today sounds like a wonderful idea at first. Unfortunately, you might become so involved with a project that you consider postponing your social plans. Establishing a productive flow can be quite satisfying, but think again before you cancel a previous engagement. Even if it requires a slight push to get out the door, you'll be glad you did once you're in motion. There's a whole wide world of possibilities awaiting you if you're willing to say yes."
scorpio,2015-01-06,"You often prefer working behind the scenes, but the proud Leo Moon dancing in your 10th House of Status encourages you to demand the recognition you deserve. You may even be tempted to overdramatize your feelings to ensure that they are heard and acknowledged today. Unfortunately, your overbearing behavior might actually produce results that are opposite to what you desire. Ironically, you won't have to practice self-restraint once you realize that letting go of your ego frees you to reach for the stars."
sagittarius,2015-01-06,"Your vivid imagination is busy dreaming up future adventures. But your eagerness to fabricate stories is stronger now than your ability to turn them into reality. However, you might discover that you don't have to worry about being so pragmatic to make your fantasies real. Lean on using your common sense by eliminating all but the most practical ideas. Then, allow plenty of time to develop your plans before you initiate action. Thinking in advance maximizes your chances for success."
capricorn,2015-01-06,"You strive to work hard, believing that personal satisfaction is yours if your goals are clearly defined. However, you still may be disappointed once you realize that you don't have all of what you want today. But even if your basic needs are  fulfilled, you might still think that something is missing -- yet you haven't a clue as to what it could be. Your frustration can get the best of you unless you truly believe that there's no hurry to find the answer. Take your time; you have a few more weeks to sort it all out."
aquarius,2015-01-06,"You might choose to stand up for yourself today if others bully you into taking a different course of action. Don't let anyone get away with assuming power that wasn't earned. If you see a friend or coworker who is misusing authority, be brave and speak up. But don't get hooked into believing that you have to prove anything. Simply getting the truth, as you see it, out into the open helps to shift the dynamics. You can be the hero if you're willing be the first to talk about what everyone else is thinking."
pisces,2015-01-06,"Your job requires a high level of visibility today, even if you don't feel like being on center stage. People can see through your attempts to make it look like you're highly focused now, whether or not your mind is actually wandering. There's no point in trying to hide the obvious. Acknowledge the richness of your current fantasy life while still doing your best to cross tasks off your list one at a time. Spending quality time in both the mundane world and the spiritual realms is your secret to success."
aries,2015-01-07,"Complications in a relationship probably won't diminish the intensity of your current connection. Unfortunately, trouble may develop if emotional or geographical distance raises issues of abandonment. However, defending yourself by assuming a self-protective posture isn't the answer. Overcome your resistance and open your heart to the unknown. Your positive attitude is your best weapon in your ongoing battle for happiness."
taurus,2015-01-07,"You might not be able to suppress your attraction to someone or something, and your feelings become more obsessive if you try to push them away. But the underlying issue now is about control -- or loss of it -- as the plans you make fall apart. Don't waste time clinging to your expectations. Instead of comparing the current flow of events to your original agenda, embracing the changes with hope and anticipation allows for the best possible outcome."
gemini,2015-01-07,"It's as if you're a marionette and someone is pulling your strings; you have no choice but to respond accordingly. You could become quite entangled if you resist, until you feel tied up in knots. Fortunately, you can rely on your mental agility to free you from the limitations. The first step is accepting responsibility for your actions. Once you acknowledge your role in creating the current restrictions, making the necessary changes will be a labor of love."
cancer,2015-01-07,"Your love life is undergoing a gradual metamorphosis that can have a great impact on your self-esteem. Your emotions are very intense, but something isn't quite right today. As much as you try to ignore the little things that might get in the way of more crucial concerns, there could be a larger problem that's not so easy to escape. Your determination to feel better about your progress motivates you to find a way through this transformational period. Lead with your heart and your head will follow."
leo,2015-01-07,"Your sunny optimism is your guiding light, even in the face of difficult circumstances. Everyone seems to be trying to tell you something, but it's hard to glean the meaning behind their words. Don't lose hope in spite of any emotional obstacles. Don't try to gloss over the lesson, even if avoidance would make your present situation temporarily easier to handle. Believe it or not, your life grows richer as you face up to the reality of the current events. The storm clouds have silver linings if you take the time to look for them."
virgo,2015-01-07,"Although you will likely receive the emotional support you seek today, there could be a darker side to the offer. You won't be satisfied unless others accept you without expecting anything in return. But there may be secret agendas and hidden clauses in the unspoken agreements now. Don't wait until you're caught off-guard by something you should have known. Be relentless in you search for the truth; shining the light of awareness into the shadows might be enough to save you from making a big mistake."
libra,2015-01-07,"You truly believe that you are clever enough to charm your way out of any problem that surfaces today, but what you encounter might not be as manageable as you expected. The more you share your feelings now, the more fuel you add to an already volatile situation. Your intuition may be telling you to make a stand, but acquiescing to the prevailing winds is a wiser strategy. Once you stop fighting against the current dynamics, you can concentrate more on your own needs. Interactions with others will flow smoother when you are in sync with your inner process."
scorpio,2015-01-07,"You are less focused on your personal issues today than you are on the larger trajectory of your life. Everything seems to be more tumultuous now while the theatrical Leo Moon is stymied by domineering Pluto, actively suppressing your passion. It's as if you're sitting on a volcano, trying to hold back the teeming lava. But too much restraint only drives the tension deeper, creating the possibility for eruption later on. The safest course of action is to reveal your feelings as gently as you can and let the energy ebb and flow naturally on its own."
sagittarius,2015-01-07,"It's hard to maintain your enthusiasm today without losing touch with reality. It's not that life is dark and gloomy; it's just that you may be feeling like the party's over and now you have to get down to work. However, your refusal to let anything spoil your day pays off later when good news changes your outlook and restores your confidence. Keep your eyes on the horizon; although the waiting is the hardest part, patience is a reliable virtue at this time."
capricorn,2015-01-07,"You typically like to keep your emotions under control, especially when you have to meet a deadline. Unfortunately, denial isn't a viable option; you won't be able to suppress your need for freedom that is now pushing its way to the surface. Instead of fighting the inevitable, just let your feelings arise naturally. Although you might rather remain cool, calm and collected, you won't be able to move on until you express what's in your heart."
aquarius,2015-01-07,"You have been seeing yourself in the mirror through rose-colored glasses recently, but the filter is changing now, temporarily dimming the rosy glow. Although you might be disappointed that everything is no longer perfect, you're also intrigued by the potential of the less-traveled road ahead. These are healing times if you are willing to follow the powerful waves of alternating hope and doubt. Creativity will rise and shine in the days ahead if you nurture the seeds that are already present in your imagination."
pisces,2015-01-07,"An influential person's attempt to convince you to change your direction at work can annoy you today because you see your future in a completely different light. You may need to defend your position, even if you wish you could just let it pass. However, if you state your case without throwing shade onto others, everything will likely work out for the best. Remember that there's nothing to fear now; your faith in yourself and those you love is stronger than anything standing in your way."
aries,2015-01-08,"Your attention is directed at getting ahead on the job now that the fun is winding down. Of course, it makes sense to organize your life and focus on your career as much as possible. But don't become so intent on your goals that you miss out on an amazing experience that's right in front of your nose. Take care of business today but don't turn down an opportunity for personal enjoyment. Adding a bit of mischief into the mix inspires you to put even more effort into your work."
taurus,2015-01-08,"If you are clear about your overall direction in life, the little things will fall into place today. Although it's helpful to define your goals in great detail, it's counterproductive now to actually compare your progress to your original expectations. Sometimes it's more productive to focus on each task as you do it without worrying about how it fits into the bigger picture. As long as you know where you're heading in the long run, cut yourself some slack and joyfully engage each moment as it comes."
gemini,2015-01-08,"Family matters can be very complicated and dealing with details at home may be a bit overwhelming today. It's your natural inclination to sweep everything under the rug, but this avoidance tactic won't solve anything. You will be much better off in the future if you get down to the real nitty-gritty as soon as you have the chance. Building trust requires honesty and perseverance, but it will be invaluable to you in the future."
cancer,2015-01-08,"Although you are often led around by your emotions, you may be able to step outside of your feelings today to see your world more objectively. Focusing on your communication skills can help you discuss even the most complex issues in depth. But don't let a conversation wander all over the place; sticking to the subject at hand will make you more effective in finding answers to the larger questions of life."
leo,2015-01-08,"Relationship dynamics at work are challenging if you have an agenda that's not fully supported by others. Nevertheless, your current confidence feeds your sense of optimism, even if it flies in the face of actual circumstances. But you may notice a crack in your armor later today when the Moon leaves your 1st House of Personality to hang out in your 2nd House of Resources. Maintain your idealism while accepting the reality of the situation. Exercising good judgment can lower your emotional cost and raise your self-esteem."
virgo,2015-01-08,"Being emotionally vulnerable is more likely now that the sensitive Moon is back in your sign. You may feel slighted if you don't receive the appreciation that you deserve for your hard work. You are usually more than willing to jump in and help others achieve their dreams. However, you must also give something back to yourself today in order to enhance the quality of your own life. There's nothing wrong with exhibiting a bit of self-interest, especially if your health and vitality could benefit from your attention."
libra,2015-01-08,"Someone may require your assistance today, but don't wait to receive a specific request. If you are concerned about a friend, pick up the phone and give them a call. He or she may only need a kind ear and a shoulder to lean on, but remember that confidentiality is crucial if you want to establish trust. You won't need to fix anything to be of value; your emotional support could have more of a positive impact than you think. Follow your intuition when it comes to helping those you love."
scorpio,2015-01-08,"You might have to take severe criticism from someone today, yet remaining open to their advice ultimately works to your advantage. Nearly everyone could get on your nerves while the fussy Virgo Moon lingers in your 11th House of Community. Your own perceptions are quite accurate now, so you easily see how others can improve their efficiency, too. Be sure to present your opinions kindly, so that your message is heard with the proper intent. Respect is a two-way street if you want to engage in a constructive dialogue."
sagittarius,2015-01-08,"The greater your dreams, the more the minutiae will require your attention. Similarly, the higher you aim, the more precision needed. Remember, you are most effective today when you handle the little things, even if you are annoyed with trivial tasks. Don't let frustration get the best of you; honor the bold Leo Moon's visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas by reaching as high as you can. However, prepare for the Moon's shift into laser-like Virgo by focusing on the fine points without resistance."
capricorn,2015-01-08,"Although you excel at playing the role of an authority figure, sometimes it's more advantageous to be humble in your approach. If you are willing to adopt a beginner's mind, a teacher can be extraordinarily helpful to you now. Listen carefully and take detailed notes so that you can learn as much as possible. The information you receive today is worthy of your time and effort if you want to experience personal growth. True enlightenment comes from being a student of life."
aquarius,2015-01-08,"Your compassion is required when dealing with a partner or close friend today. However, a thorough examination of your communication style can also reveal hidden patterns that you need to know about now. Although you might wish you could fast forward to a happy ending, working through the complex issues first makes any solution more enduring. Demonstrate your commitment to the relationship by showing up with an open mind and a loving heart."
pisces,2015-01-08,"You might believe your good intentions are solid enough to make a relationship work. Unfortunately, your idealism isn't necessarily being played out by the current circumstances. Even if you aren't ready, your friend or partner could want more of a commitment from you. Or, perhaps you have unresolved issues that you don't want to talk about yet. Emotional detachment only works as a temporary fix; sooner or later you must come clean if you want to experience more love and happiness."
aries,2015-01-09,"Your irrepressible idealism won't save you from the potential trouble caused by your irreverent behavior as you seek out the next adrenaline rush. You may be so excited that you lose track of your common sense and serious problems can arise if you don't stop to think before you act. However, a carefully calculated gamble might prove to be a lot of fun if you remember to take the necessary precautions along the way. Better safe than sorry."
taurus,2015-01-09,"You might believe that you have entered a Karma-Free Zone but your current actions have very real consequences. Although you yearn to break away from someone's control today, you don't seem to be able to exert your authority over others. Nevertheless, the message is clear; no one can keep you locked up now if you think you are free. The immediate key to your happiness is to consider which rules you're willing to accept and then adhere to them happily. There is plenty of room to be true to yourself within the acknowledged limits."
gemini,2015-01-09,"Following your instincts can lead you into an exciting but unstable situation today. Normally, you are tentative about your participation in a group activity until you check out all the angles. However, you're thrilled with the idea of jumping into the unknown on a whim. Don't fight the impulse to initiate action; enjoy the fun while it lasts. You have a short-lived chance to create a magical memory that will make your heart happy."
cancer,2015-01-09,"You're tired of waiting for the right career opportunity to present itself. You want results now and may be motivated to gamble on your future. However, your current sense of immediacy could trigger a hasty decision that doesn't necessarily support your long-term plans. Practicing a little more patience is your smartest strategy; you can always continue to explore your options in the safety of your own mind. Think twice before ambitiously trying a radical solution when a more conservative one will do the trick."
leo,2015-01-09,"Even if you recently cooled your jets and readjusted your timeline, taking a wait-and-see approach today won't work for you. Something unexpected occurs that requires you to react immediately. Although you still prefer to consider all of your options, you might not want to pass by an opportunity to explore something that stimulates your sense of adventure. Don't be afraid to experiment with the edge; you can always work out the necessary details later on. Bold action generates the very excitement you seek."
virgo,2015-01-09,"You may be pulled into someone's emotional melodrama today, reactivating old fears from days gone by. Ironically, you are eagerly anticipating a chance to conquer your demons and put them to rest once and for all. You have skirted around this scary memory long enough; it's now time to dive into the heart of the matter and finally release the past. The potential for lasting reward is great if you are willing to face the music and dance with the devil."
libra,2015-01-09,"Although you have recently experienced many unusual things, your partner or a friend might do something today that takes you totally by surprise. In fact, you may secretly wish that you were the one rebellious enough to break the rules and behave in an outrageous manner. Get ahead of the curve by planning how to make your unrealized dreams come true. You really don't have to rely on someone else to act out your suppressed desires. Your preemptive strike is better than patiently waiting for something to save you from yourself."
scorpio,2015-01-09,"The familiar pattern of your daily routine is often reassuring and enables you to feel secure about your life. However, you may be longing to break free from your regular grind so you can do something radically different today. But it's tricky to put your plan into motion because you don't know how much effort to exert to get what you want. Pushing too hard can stir up a hornet's nest while letting the opportunity pass will leave you feeling flat. Nevertheless, it's better to err on the side of risk now than caution if you want to live life to the fullest."
sagittarius,2015-01-09,"You may be climbing the walls today, especially if your creativity is being restrained in any manner. You are so eager for adventure that you could overlook your current responsibilities to pursue your eclectic ideas. Unfortunately, you're still expected to play according to the rules, and your brilliance might not have a chance to shine if you end up offending others. Don't give up; your persistence enables you to work within accepted conventions while also expressing your unique outlook on life."
capricorn,2015-01-09,"You might be overly worried about keeping your secrets quiet today, especially if you have something wild in your background that others don't know about. But your fears may be unwarranted; be brave and risk judgment by sharing your story with someone you trust. Your shy resistance could quickly transform into giddy exhilaration as soon as you start to talk. Cracking open a door to vulnerability can be scary at first, but now it's worth taking the chance."
aquarius,2015-01-09,"An unexpected conversation with a coworker or close friend can rattle your nerves today because you are shocked where the discussion goes. Luckily, you're not receiving bad news; it's more about having your old assumptions questioned and your core values challenged. Don't cling to a familiar belief that has outlived its purpose; instead, focus on the freedom that a new perspective brings. The future grows brighter and your heart becomes lighter once you leave your worn-out baggage in the past."
pisces,2015-01-09,"You are poised to do something today that is totally out of your normal range of conduct, but you believe that extraordinary times require extraordinary measures. The vast array of possibilities is intoxicating, but it's prudent to exercise a bit of discretionary caution or you might end up wasting money on something you don't really need. In fact, your happiness is not dependent on acquiring anything in the material world. However, you could discover a real bargain on a ticket to a magical experience that will make you smile for a long time to come."
aries,2015-01-10,"You might blast ahead with your original plans even though they could lead to more trouble than they are worth. Ironically, your common sense is working fine today; the problem is your inclination to fearlessly overrule reason with your desires. Fortunately, you can minimize the negative impact of your carelessness by repeatedly reminding yourself to slow down and think about what you're doing. It may sound like a familiar warning, but the sky is the limit if  you stop to acknowledge your immediate surroundings before moving forward."
taurus,2015-01-10,"Don't rely on your friends for sound advice today, because they are likely to encourage your dreams, no matter how impossible your goals may be to manifest. Of course, receiving support from an ally feels great, but you might be better off if someone told you that your idea is ill-conceived. If you truly want to know whether or not you should proceed, make an objective list of all the pros and cons and then follow the most obvious conclusion. The good news is you have the capability to make the most intelligent choice all by yourself."
gemini,2015-01-10,"You may be able to come up with plenty of reasons to decline a current opportunity, but you will likely say yes, anyhow. It's tough to see the downside of the current situation today because your hopes are so high and any progress appears to be better than none at all. Just remember that you might face discouragement if you continue to harbor such outrageous expectations. Taking the medicine of reality isn't painful at all and can actually help you stay healthy through tumultuous times."
cancer,2015-01-10,"Normally, your need for emotional security leads you to set boundaries so you don't destabilize your life. Nevertheless, you also like to be as cooperative as possible. Today, these two strategies collide as your optimism tempts you to take on more commitments than you should. Don't let things reach a breaking point before you pull back to protect your heart. It's a sign of strength to recognize your limits before it's too late."
leo,2015-01-10,"You have big plans on your mind but it doesn't serve you well to lose sight of what's actually possible today. Your extroverted nature usually works in your favor, but you might attract so much positive feedback now that you begin to believe you are invincible. Much to your chagrin, you haven't yet transformed into a superhero, so step back from the excitement and downsize your intentions before they get the best of you."
virgo,2015-01-10,"Managing your mood swings may be a challenging task today because the reflective Moon in your sign puts you in close touch with your changing emotions. However, your innate sense of clarity is tough to find now because you can't help but see amazing possibilities everywhere you look. Keep in mind that you might be better off waiting a day or two before making any life-altering decisions. Fortunately, you will be able to make smart choices again once your rational perspective returns."
libra,2015-01-10,"Putting on a happy face won't resolve your worries, especially if you discover problems with someone's plans for the day. Instead of covering your concerns with a quick smile, express your opinions as objectively as you can. You may be able to justify your thoughts, but your logical words aren't necessarily without their bias. Thankfully, setting your perspective out on the table might spark an informative conversation. Even if the discussion doesn't lead to a concrete solution, at least it prompts you to think about the most crucial issues with an open mind."
scorpio,2015-01-10,"You are socially astute today and intuitively know exactly how much pressure to apply to a situation to get what you want. However, your wisdom could fly out the window once you see some positive results from your actions and you impulsively decide to ask for more. Remember, too much drama can prompt your most valuable supporters to retreat in haste. There's nothing wrong with having grandiose ambitions as long as you know when to stop pushing and when to be grateful for your blessings."
sagittarius,2015-01-10,"You're trying to keep your ambitious goals from taking over your entire day, but bombastic Jupiter may not know how to take no for an answer now. Although a current boost of confidence can help if you're suffering from low self-esteem, it could be too much if you're already bouncing off the walls with enthusiastic anticipation. However, it's up to you to know how to best channel your energy. Take your foot off the gas pedal and gently coast for a while; you might enjoy the ride even more."
capricorn,2015-01-10,"Your pragmatic approach to managing a rather large project can put you in the driver's seat as others give up before they gain any traction. Thankfully, you know that you're well suited for the job and are ready to give it your absolute best. Be careful; your perceptions are bent a bit out of shape by your desire to succeed, so it's still wise to exercise caution today. Instead of trying to do the impossible and failing, set realistic goals that you can surpass."
aquarius,2015-01-10,"You may attempt to simplify complex relationship dynamics today because it's easier to figure out your game plan when everything is neat and tidy. But leaving out the complicating factors just to suit your whim is not an intelligent idea. It's smarter to work with all the facts and be unsure of your next move than to arbitrarily avoid the truth to feed your false sense of security. Remember, ignorance is not bliss; however, knowledge does lead to power."
pisces,2015-01-10,"You are moving ahead with your new objectives and might even be proud of your significant progress. However, there may be danger lurking in your current optimism. Of course, the power of positive thought fosters success, but it might also prevent you from seeing an important truth if you take your hopeful perspective to an extreme. Keep your sails filled with air by remaining open to the prevailing winds of change."
aries,2015-01-11,"Expressing your relationship goals clearly is crucial today, but your personal needs may be at odds with what is expected of you. Finding common ground in this particular conflict is challenging because your obligations make it difficult to follow your heart. Nevertheless, don't give up by denying your feelings; you will ultimately have more choices if you state your truth -- contradictions and all -- instead of trying to avoid it. There is no substitute for honest communication when it comes to love."
taurus,2015-01-11,"You may be running around in circles as you go from one activity to another today, even if you intend to finish everything you start. Your plan is to complete each job, but you're easily distracted by the variety of unexplored paths in front of you. Don't be too concerned about how much you accomplish now. Getting a handle on your reluctance to change could be more powerful than proving your ability to be productive. Expanding your horizons might make you nervous at first, but it's time to spread your wings and fly."
gemini,2015-01-11,"You are eagerly anticipating the rising energy of the day, but a bit of unexpected turbulence can make it tricky to surf the incoming cosmic waves. Instead of complaining about the intensity of the rough waters, shift your perspective and embrace the next round of excitement into your life. It's really not necessary to find lasting solutions to any of the problems that now pop up. You're better off navigating your way as if this is a temporary situation, instead of assuming that it's a permanent part of your life. Your positive attitude makes all the difference in the world."
cancer,2015-01-11,"You're so intensely focused on maintaining harmony in your relationships now that it's challenging to see what's around the next corner. But even if you attempt to ignore your current feelings of uncertainty, you won't be able to do so for long. Your eyes are big and wide open today, and once you realize what is behind the curtain, you want others to see it, too. But don't wait until an uncomfortable situation becomes too overwhelming to handle. Bring what you know out into the light as soon as you learn the truth. Awareness is your secret to success."
leo,2015-01-11,"Playing other people's games according to their arbitrary rules was acceptable for a while, but you are driven to add your critical opinion to the situation now. Your friends might expect you to continue in the same old manner, but you are motivated to clarify confusing boundaries so you can reestablish your authority today. Overreacting isn't useful, but neither can you stay quiet. Ultimately, it's wise to just let others know exactly what you need and let the chips fall as they may."
virgo,2015-01-11,"It could take several more days for relationship dynamics to settle down, so it still makes sense to stir up the energy now to see where it goes. Conflicts that escalate today are symptoms of deeper material issues that are not yet resolved. You can probably talk yourself into believing almost anything that ends well. Nevertheless, you will be happier if you prepare to readjust your thinking if a reality check points to a different conclusion. Hope for the best but keep a backup plan in your pocket just in case."
libra,2015-01-11,"Your emotions are very close to the surface today as the reflective Moon returns to your sign. Nevertheless, turning feelings into decisive action is a daunting task. Your moods shift often and every single thought you have brings up another feeling that is different from the last. Someone may attempt to force you to make a choice, but it isn't necessary yet. Wait a few more days before deciding what to do. In the meantime, enjoy riding the highs and lows without getting trapped by either extreme."
scorpio,2015-01-11,"Gently floating downstream in the flow of your feelings sounds idyllic today, but each time you begin to get comfortable, practical thoughts wake you from your pleasant reverie. You may grow increasingly aware that the real events in your daily life must take precedence over everything else. It grows tougher to land yourself back on solid earth, yet this is exactly what is needed to make the most of this auspicious time."
sagittarius,2015-01-11,"You might actually think your current solution to a lingering problem is a fair and sensible one. However, it's not very wise to move too quickly today, for you could change your mind a few more times before you settle on one particular answer. Be careful; your inflated sense of urgency may deceive you into acting impulsively. Count to ten and then count again before making your move."
capricorn,2015-01-11,"Although you desperately want to excel at your current efforts, you don't have to do it at someone else's expense. The Moon's shift into your 10th House of Status demands that you consider the needs of others if you want to be an effective leader. Climbing over those around you to climb the ladder of success will ultimately serve no one at all. You can gain more authority now by tuning in to the group consciousness and acting for the good of all."
aquarius,2015-01-11,"You could come across with more confidence than you actually feel now that the calculating Capricorn Sun forms an imbalanced alignment with effusive Jupiter. Although you may be projecting your biases, you're ready to change your mind on a moment's notice if you are offered facts that cut through your defenses. But your apparent bravado can be a deterrent if it scares others away from sharing their ideas with you. Soften your assertive stance to make room for a meaningful dialogue with those you love."
pisces,2015-01-11,"A complex partnership that was initially based upon equality can temporarily encounter uncomfortable dynamics today, especially if someone exerts pressure on you. Unfortunately, your partner might be sinking deeper into the relationship just as you are withdrawing into your own private world. Show some foresight with an objective approach that rebuilds trust. Paradoxically, you might have to step back before making a long-term commitment. Fostering your independence now increases the potential for a closer relationship in the future."
aries,2015-01-12,"You don't want to make anyone's life more complicated today as seeking peaceful solutions to ongoing problems is a high priority. Although you may be less willing to fight now that your key planet Mars is swimming through the compassionate waters of Pisces, you're still likely to passionately react if someone pushes you too far. Defend your territory if necessary, but show your real strength by establishing common ground instead of insisting that things go your way. Cooperation is more constructive than competition."
taurus,2015-01-12,"You have so much to do that it's crucial to avoid being overwhelmed by all the details. Concentrate on your productivity today while the Moon is still busy in your 6th House of Work. Advanced planning plays an important role in your current drive for efficiency, but allow time to rest between tasks in order to sustain your energy throughout the day. Long-term strategies are more successful now than flying by the seat of your pants. You know better than anyone else that slow and steady wins the race."
gemini,2015-01-12,"You may be caught up in your own nervous energy today, but trying to make too much happen right away can wreak havoc. Taking a deep breath and finding your center ensures smooth progress. If you scatter too many seeds now you could wear yourself out trying to juggle all your commitments. The fruits of your labor will be rewarded if you remember to be patient while striving to reach your destination. Keep calm and carry on."
cancer,2015-01-12,"A little annoyance can precipitate an emotional meltdown if you believe that ignoring your feelings will make them go away. Don't hide your heart in the sand; instead, face stressful circumstances head on by considering a variety of available options. Choose the most sensible course of action, but remember that it's not necessary to clear new paths where none are needed. Casting light on an issue goes a long way toward discovering a lasting solution."
leo,2015-01-12,"The pace of your life is quickening again, bringing a taste of excitement along with great potential for change. However, it's not productive to push your agenda onto anyone else at this time. Instead, make the best of the present moment by listening carefully and responding graciously. You have more time than you realize to prepare for future opportunities. Refining your strategy now is wiser than waiting for the action to begin."
virgo,2015-01-12,"Exploring the source of your anxiety today pays off in the weeks ahead. You have been busy putting all the pieces in place as you mapped out your goals with cautious determination. Now, as your adrenaline begins to stir, you may worry about the execution of your plan and how it affects other people. Run through it one last time in your mind and then let go because your attention is required in the present moment in all manner of communications. The quality of your relationships just might be the determining factor of your success."
libra,2015-01-12,"You are acutely aware of the importance of the decisions you're facing today and are determined to take your time and make the right choice. However, people seem to be meddling in your business, trying to persuade you to follow their advice. Luckily, you are so in tune with your own needs now that your instincts are your best source of guidance. Follow your intuition: you are the only one who can know when it's time to tip the scales one way or the other."
scorpio,2015-01-12,"You are usually quite comfortable knowing more than you share, but today the situation may be reversed. You could actually be missing a crucial piece of information and wish you had someone to consult with. However, don't be so suspicious; it's not likely that anyone is purposefully withholding anything from you. Ask the right questions and you might receive the answers you need. But don't hold on to your fears if satisfaction isn't forthcoming; some things remain a mystery for a reason."
sagittarius,2015-01-12,"Gaining clarity on your wildest dreams can be enlightening now because if you make the right choices, they might actually come true. Naturally, it's not quite that simple, but you do have the potential to lay a foundation for your future by sharing your goals with friends and coworkers today. Don't waste this moment on meaningless fantasies. Being conscious of your true intentions prepares you to step into the next chapter of your life."
capricorn,2015-01-12,"Your nerves may be on edge today as you contemplate the uncertainty in your future. Oddly enough, you are still quite confident about where you are going; however, you could be confused about which path to follow to reach your destination. You might need to take on more responsibilities to conserve your resources, which could distract you from your long-term ambitions. Be as flexible as possible when responding to the inevitable changes. For the next few weeks, your adaptability is your secret weapon."
aquarius,2015-01-12,It's more tempting today to dream of the future than to concentrate on the present moment. Your sense of urgency is waning and your overall energy is shifting now that industrious Mars is leaving your sign and entering your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. You are more willing to put extra effort toward a project that will take time to come to fruition because you can see the value of your contribution. But don't exhaust yourself by taking on too much at once; you will go further and last longer by maintaining a slower burn.
pisces,2015-01-12,"You are on the launch pad, ready to blast into orbit as fiery Mars shifts into your empathic sign today to ignite your emotions. However, since compassion is one of your greatest strengths, it's time for you to express this highest form of love. Just make sure to move carefully or you could get swallowed up by someone else's pain or misfortune. Giving yourself permission to step back from the crowd to cultivate a spiritual practice is not selfish; it's essential for your mind, body and spirit."
aries,2015-01-13,"A friend or coworker might tell you something that you prefer not to hear today, but you're so involved with talking about your career plans or a specific project that you don't even notice. Instead of being wrapped up in your own version of the story, refocus your attention on the point that others are trying to get across. Carry the light of your awareness when stepping into the shadows that appear in front of you. You have the power to transform your fear into courage if you're willing to give change a chance."
taurus,2015-01-13,"Finding simple pleasures within your regular work routine is your fastest path to happiness today with the gracious Libra Moon visiting your 6th House of Habits. You are at your best now that the important things are going according to your plan. Nevertheless, you're not fully satisfied; you're yearning for more excitement in your life. You might even do something crazy to pump extra energy into your day. Walk on the edge but maintain enough balance so you don't fall in the process."
gemini,2015-01-13,"You thrive on the creative buzz you receive from the artistic Libra Moon now as she dances through your 5th House of Self-Expression. Your exuberance is amped even higher now that electric Uranus is rattling your cage. You're in a playful mood, yet still eager to do something productive with your most colorful ideas. However, there is no need to be worry about the end result yet; just take enough time to express yourself as boldly and authentically as you can."
cancer,2015-01-13,"Logical analysis isn't usually your primary consideration when making decisions because you seafaring Crabs are emotional beings. However, you may grow anxious as your rational thoughts lead to one conclusion while your heart chooses to head off in a different direction. Exploring all desires is a luxury, but it's safe as long as you keep them within your imagination. Nevertheless, you don't have to act on every whim. For now, know that your dilemma will begin to fade once the Moon moves into watery Scorpio later this evening."
leo,2015-01-13,"You are so busy that you don't have time to pursue your heart's desire today. Perhaps you have simply tried to pack too much into your schedule. Or maybe you have details to settle that you thought were already completed. Either way, don't get lazy and let your responsibilities slide, even if you wish you could take the day off. Fortunately, taking pride in your accomplishments brings the ultimate in satisfaction. Work now, play later."
virgo,2015-01-13,"Carve out some time to uncover the hidden meanings behind the information coming your way now. Fortunately, there's great potential in the future of your relationships because there may be an opportunity for healing, especially around issues of love and romance. The Sun is still shining brightly in your 5th House of Fun, yet it's tricky to know how deep you need to dig in order to overcome whatever's blocking your creativity. Relax into the flow; there's no deadline on processing your feelings. Things don't have to change overnight."
libra,2015-01-13,"You are painting your life using a very wide palette of feelings now. You're attracted to new and different ways of having fun, even if you are judged for following your bliss. Unfortunately, people may see you as moodier than usual today, but establishing a spiritual practice can help to settle your erratic emotions. Silently build your case for whatever actions you are taking but don't say too much about your plans just yet. Instead of overplaying your hand, wait a few days until you find the answers within before sharing your ideas. A mysterious smile will say more than words."
scorpio,2015-01-13,"You may seek solace within the confines of your own inner world today since the evocative Moon is lingering in your 12th House of Secrets. Thankfully, you know that your ability to create peace in your life begins with accepting your own feelings. But it's not wise to overdo the everything-is-wonderful philosophy or you won't be motivated to initiate the changes necessary to be truly happy. Combining a dash of self-forgiveness with a carefully considered  action plan could produce positive results once the Moon returns to your sign later in the day."
sagittarius,2015-01-13,"You might be living in a bubble where you believe that the good times will last forever, but they won't. Nevertheless, you have nothing to fear now. Every cycle must wax and wane in its own time, as does the light of the silvery Moon. Even if you have recently been riding an emotional high, the energy shifts today and you may have to moderate your exuberance. But there's no reason to be discouraged if you can't pursue every desire. Discuss your concerns with a trusted companion; leaning on your friends for support helps you remember what's most important."
capricorn,2015-01-13,"You want everyone around you to be satisfied and will do your part to make it happen. Nevertheless, you're not prepared to sacrifice your integrity for any reason. You might have to face a dilemma now that creates stress from these two conflicting points of view. Ultimately, you must play the role of the judge and decide how the next phase of your life unfolds. Even if you aren't the final authority, you're still responsible for your own actions -- and whatever you do today has a lasting impact on tomorrow."
aquarius,2015-01-13,"Your charisma is off the charts and you're on the prowl for excitement today. Although you might try to keep your energy on an even keel, your mind is racing as you consider all the things you want to do. Practicality is not one of your immediate concerns as rebellious Uranus connects with indulgent Venus in your sign. Nevertheless, you have more freedom to explore the edges if you keep things running as smoothly as possible. Luckily, with a bit of conscious intention and sensitivity to others, you can get away with being as weird as you want."
pisces,2015-01-13,"You intuitively pick up subtle messages that inform you of the needs of others, yet it's nearly impossible to get a clear read on the incoming signals today. Someone's behavior may appear to be out of control and you're concerned enough to step in to help now. Even if you're ready to swing into action, you still might restrain yourself at the last moment due to a lack of confidence. However, there's no reason to hold back; you're stronger than you realize. Let your friends lean on you while you are up for the challenge of saving the day. Playing the role of a superhero is easier than you think."
aries,2015-01-14,"You seem to be growing increasingly impatient each day, especially if someone is more interested in getting to the bottom of your current feelings than moving on to whatever happens next. You might feel as if you're trapped. Nevertheless, investing your time to delve into an emotional issue might be exactly what the doctor ordered. Set aside your desire for personal satisfaction for a couple of days. Finish up old relationship business now before distracting yourself with something shiny and new."
taurus,2015-01-14,"Your emotions may not be apparent to others now, but that doesn't make them any less important. An old memory that's buried in a hidden corner of your mind has unexpected power over your unconscious actions. Fortunately, a friend or partner should be able to help you explore the shadows of your past, but you must be willing to stick with the issues as they surface today. Don't avoid the unknown because your current vulnerability can lead to exciting emotional growth."
gemini,2015-01-14,"You might feel threatened by a coworker's competitive nature today as the primal Scorpio Moon intensifies already raw emotions and lessens your interest in playing fair. You are postured to defend your territory, even if you haven't been personally attacked. Thankfully, you can discover the truth before any open hostilities are exchanged. There is nothing in particular that you must do to experience the healing energy now. Luckily, a change of heart opens the door to closer relationships at work."
cancer,2015-01-14,"Your fear of rejection makes you feel uncomfortable about sharing your innermost thoughts with others. A cluster of planets in sympathetic Pisces urges you to take your emotions more seriously. You crave intimacy, but you might not be ready for that level of emotional disclosure yet. Meanwhile, you are eager to grow professionally in your craft. Thankfully, concentrating on your career objectives might be the perfect distraction for now."
leo,2015-01-14,"You love the notion of being close to someone special, but still prefer to keep the energy lighthearted today. However, competent Mars is approaching dreamy Neptune in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, instigating an inner conflict between your desire for intimacy and your fear of vulnerability. The fact of the matter is you won't be satisfied now by keeping things on a superficial level. Don't try to rationalize your actions; instead, give yourself permission to follow your heart rather than your head."
virgo,2015-01-14,"You take quiet pride in being able to analyze the dynamics of a situation and create an effective plan that's beneficial for all. However, several planets are traveling through diffusive Pisces now, making it more difficult to determine which information is useful. Instead of obsessing about what you don't know, nurture significant relationships based upon your feelings. But be careful not to overreact; getting too immersed in the details now could lead you to miss the most obvious solutions to your current dilemma. Open your eyes and your heart at the same time."
libra,2015-01-14,"Your world may be settling down now, after a few days of lunar instability. But it's challenging, nonetheless, to keep your spirits up when sobering Saturn is in the picture. You are ultra-serious today; even if opportunities abound, you might grow discouraged by an apparent lack of success. Nevertheless, maintain consistency in your daily routine because it will eventually bring you the satisfaction you seek. Flaunting your creativity is good for your soul, but it's more rewarding to play by the rules for the next several days, instead."
scorpio,2015-01-14,"Your own thoughts might overwhelm you today until you stop resisting the shifting emotional tides. Fluctuating moods complicate your interpersonal communication as the inconstant Moon visits your sign, making it difficult to know how long any emotion will last before transforming into something else. Don't waste your time or energy endlessly worrying about things that are out of your control. The future depends on your willingness to embrace the unknown."
sagittarius,2015-01-14,"Although you might be afraid that you're approaching the end of a road, you are also at the start of something new. Instead of trying to stop the inevitable, finish what you can while the powerful Scorpio Moon is activating your 12th House of Destiny. Practicing detachment makes sense now because you need to let go of your previous expectations. However, you may not be able to do it by yourself, so accept assistance when it's offered. The creative process is enhanced when you lower your defenses and allows others to help."
capricorn,2015-01-14,"Your friends may be shocked when they learn of your unorthodox perspective. However, you're so focused on reaching your goals now that you're not worried about anyone else's expectations. Nevertheless, you don't like it if others try to give you direction and you might fight back if they push too hard. Nevertheless, it isn't worth turning an ally into an enemy, even if you have to temporarily downplay your plans to avoid conflict. Your willingness to compromise can end up saving the day."
aquarius,2015-01-14,"Normally, you're not one to succumb to peer pressure, yet people seem to be offering you sound financial advice now. But even if you don't have a solid plan in place, you still prefer to figure it out on your own rather than using someone else's solution. It's one thing to show everyone that you're an independent thinker, but you can demonstrate your real intelligence today by listening to those who have your best interests at heart. Make the most strategic decision you can, no matter where the idea originates."
pisces,2015-01-14,"You are inclined to take radical measures once again. The intensity can present problems because several planets in imaginative Pisces blur the fine line between being spiritually inspired and losing yourself in a fantasy. Thankfully, you receive a reality check from practical Saturn, preventing your visions of the future from floating off into the clouds. Don't be afraid to dream; just make sure you stay anchored to the earth when you travel."
aries,2015-01-15,"Your natural restlessness prompts you to blast your way forward no matter what the signs are saying; however, this isn't a winning strategy today. Your key planet Mars is telling you that all systems are go, yet your path seems to be blocked now, nonetheless. You don't have to add to the frustration by trying so valiantly to overpower the current obstacles. Make the most of the stressful cosmic energy by creating a long-term plan to clear the road ahead before progressing further. Work smarter, not harder."
taurus,2015-01-15,"You have chores to do today that may not be much fun, especially if your current responsibilities don't leave you any time to explore more creative pursuits. Even if you think you can meet your obligations, it's still wiser to temper your expectations. Unfortunately, your boss could misinterpret your confidence and pile on more tasks instead of praising you for your hard work. Understate your optimism and focus on productivity, instead."
gemini,2015-01-15,"Although you may establish ambitious goals today, your progress is delayed by unforeseen circumstances. Rather than letting negativity get the best of you, acknowledge your current limitations and then focus on your strengths. Everything should turn out fine as long as you don't promise too much. However, even a simple task could go awry if you commit to more than you can deliver. Take full responsibility for your actions without apologizing for something that's beyond your control."
cancer,2015-01-15,"Your intuition is encouraging you to do something you have never done, like going on a fantastic adventure in an exotic location. Unfortunately, your vision might have to remain unfulfilled for now because real world commitments are calling. Nevertheless, you don't have to give up on your idea, however unrealistic it may sound in the moment. Instead, consider taking small steps toward an impossible dream, even if it seems very far away. There is no hurry; patience is your most valuable asset now."
leo,2015-01-15,"Your ability to quickly organize the various parts of a complex job can turn you into a hero today. But people may continue to make unreasonable demands on your time, even if you're not able to help them out. Although you might be tempted to express your frustration and set someone straight, it's much smarter to just step aside and let others figure it out on their own. They will ultimately appreciate your skill in executing a defensive strategy when it's to your advantage to avoid conflict. Taking the high road serves everyone's best interests."
virgo,2015-01-15,"Uncharacteristically, you're tempted to throw all caution to the wind and run as fast as you can toward your current destination. You can't help but be as restless as a tiger in a cage now as impulsive Mars floods your system with adrenaline to trigger an immediate response. However, your apparent proximity to the finish line is the result of your mind playing tricks on you. Instead, maintain a sustainable pace while reserving some energy for when you need it later on. Think of this as a marathon and not a sprint."
libra,2015-01-15,"You have extra energy to take on more projects at work -- or so it seems. It turns out that you could underestimate the size of a job now and find yourself in trouble when you cannot meet your commitments. Instead of trying to make yourself look better in another person's eyes by making promises you can't keep, stick as close to the facts as possible while planning your day. If you don't rein in your energy today, someone might have to do it for you. Sidestep stress by practicing enlightened self-restraint."
scorpio,2015-01-15,"You have too much happening in your life now to let your anger impede your productivity or diminish your happiness. Luckily, you can magically transform the current situation by telling others exactly what you want. But giving orders isn't sufficient; you must lead by example. The bottom line is that you cannot ask anyone to do anything that you're not fully prepared to do yourself. Your positive attitude is a perfect complement to your hard work."
sagittarius,2015-01-15,"You might be uncertain about your actions at work today, even if you can justify them to your associates. Unfortunately, you could be stopped in your tracks anyhow because authoritative Saturn -- now in your sign -- won't let you proceed if you're not fully prepared or if you're heading in the wrong direction. Don't allow self-doubt to adversely affect your efforts; the current obstacles are there to remind you to stop spinning your wheels and to concentrate your intent on the most significant matters first. Your chances for success greatly improve if you have a viable plan in place."
capricorn,2015-01-15,"You're not one to shy away from hard work, but you will be much more productive if you set healthy limits. Karmic Saturn puts you through your paces today, testing your resolve to accomplish your goals. Nevertheless, you can't take on more responsibilities just because red-hot Mars fires up your ambitions. Do your best to help out those in need, but don't be afraid to say no when necessary. Even you tireless Capricorns need to recharge your batteries now and then."
aquarius,2015-01-15,"You may be feeling the social bug now, especially if your friends entice you with invitations to intriguing gatherings. However, your boss might be leaning on you to do extra work, even if you prefer to take a bit of time off. This conflict forces you to make difficult decisions about your schedule. Leaving the fun and games behind is not your first choice, but it may be the right one. In the long run, your answer is less important than your attitude. Accepting your responsibilities with a sense of pride shows that you mean business when it comes to your work."
pisces,2015-01-15,"Openly disagreeing with anyone is not your idea of a good time, but you still may need to stand up for your convictions now if someone gets in your way. Unfortunately, whoever tries to stop you from reaching your goals probably wields quite a bit of power. However, you have much to gain by facing the current resistance instead of simply acquiescing without saying what's on your mind. Nevertheless, downplaying your progress may be a wise strategy so you can appear like less of a threat to those in charge. The only person you have to prove anything to is yourself."
aries,2015-01-16,"You may be thinking about heading to your dream destination with the Moon moving through your 9th House of Faraway Places. But this isn't just about a vacation. You are on a mission as you search for your special place on Earth. Forget about immediate gratification; this journey is important enough that you shouldn't take no for an answer now, even if you can't follow through on your explorations yet. Setting your sights on the horizon is a good place to start, but it will take hard work and determination if you want to make your dream come true."
taurus,2015-01-16,"A dilemma could surface today around your need for simplicity, even within a complex situation. You are driven to find the most practical solutions to your problems, but it's not as easy as you wish. You may inadvertently contradict your intentions by saying more than necessary. Stirring up someone's wrath isn't the best path to a peaceful day. Luckily, a bit of conscious self-restraint might have a longer-lasting positive impact than you expect."
gemini,2015-01-16,"Although you often enjoy bantering with people who are as clever as you, today you may actually try to avoid others because you're not interested in debating your opinion on every subject. Unfortunately, seeking solitude isn't the best way to deal with smart people who might contradict your stated position. Be open to learning something you don't already know. It's a sign of real intelligence when you can admit you are wrong and someone else is right."
cancer,2015-01-16,"You are typically cautious in how you present yourself, but today you could consider drastic action in your haste for self-improvement. Nevertheless, it's better to test an idea by discussing it first, instead of just jumping in and making changes you can't undo. Taking the time to think your plan all the way through ensures that your actions will have the greatest positive effect on your future. Cultivating your creativity is an admirable pursuit as long as you don't try to paint your masterpiece in just one day."
leo,2015-01-16,"Romantic inclinations can make your life more interesting today, but you may have mixed emotions as to whether or not to act on your feelings. The Moon is skipping through your 5th House of Love and her alignment with cold Saturn and hot Mars is simultaneously discouraging and encouraging. Impulsive behavior won't likely create a happy ending to your fairy tale, but a fortunate outcome is possible if you stop and express both sides of your dilemma. Ultimately, pleasure won't arrive on its own; it's up to you to make the first move and get the ball rolling."
virgo,2015-01-16,"You may be able to tell that an emotional power struggle is brewing beneath the surface today, even if others are acting as if everything is copacetic. However, someone may be less than friendly, although you haven't a clue why. Be patient and don't ask too many questions; it could take a few days for the real issues to manifest. In the meantime, do your best to avoid open conflict since happiness can only be attained through awareness, compassion and growth."
libra,2015-01-16,"You're quite capable of turning on the charm, even in the most difficult situations. But your friends might notice an emotional chill from you now that the Moon is hooking up with somber Saturn in your 3rd House of Communication. Fortunately, you can still make your point as long as you don't try to cover up your true intentions with social niceties. You can act kindly without laying on false sweetness; a no-nonsense approach brings the best results today."
scorpio,2015-01-16,"Your relationship to your material possessions is undergoing a dramatic shift as you reconsider what you want these days. You might be willing or even eager to let go of once-prized belongings that have turned into unneeded baggage. Your values are transforming and it's time to lighten your load emotionally and physically so you're better able to travel the road ahead, unencumbered by the weight of your past."
sagittarius,2015-01-16,"You do not want to waste precious energy on a communication mix-up today. Nor do you want to be misled by anyone because your feelings are strong and your patience is short. You just don't have time for playing games now; you expect everyone to get right to the point. Your emotions may be raw, so give yourself time to process inwardly before revealing any insecurities to those who have not already earned your trust. Following your intuition, rather than other people's expectations, leaves little chance for regret."
capricorn,2015-01-16,"A lighthearted daydream can morph into an obsessive fantasy if you let your guard down. Oddly enough, the more you try to set your thoughts aside, the more they linger and gain strength. Suppression doesn't work now, so just let your imagination play through even if it raises uncomfortable fears or desires. Mental meanderings are more troublesome and persistent if you bury them. Channel your inner artist by expressing your visions in a creative manner."
aquarius,2015-01-16,"You may be overly demonstrative about a social or political issue with the Moon camped out in your 11th House of Groups. However, you are less interested in going along for a ride than you are in focusing your efforts on making a difference. With karmic Saturn so close to the Moon, your contribution will most likely be appreciated by others. But act now because of your own values and not because someone wants you to get involved with their pet cause. Things will fall into place if your inner world is in alignment with the circumstances around you."
pisces,2015-01-16,"You might think you're being straightforward today, but your actions don't necessarily support your intentions. At first, your behavior could be awkward as you hold your feelings in. But then, when you realize you're not being authentic, you can overcompensate by revealing too much. Ultimately, you must find a healthy outlet for your conscious expression that is neither too hot or too cold, but just right."
aries,2015-01-17,"The incoming waves of excitement are so palpable that they could distract you from your previous plans. Your bigger-than-life fantasies keep your anticipation level high, even as you face pressure to meet your current obligations. Obviously, there are unchangeable circumstances, so accept reality as it is and just get busy. Don't worry about missing the big one; the truth is you won't be able to avoid it."
taurus,2015-01-17,"Monitoring your thoughts carefully throughout the day enables you to settle down, yet you still could be easily provoked if you believe someone is talking about you behind your back. Unfortunately, off-the-cuff witticisms won't likely land you where you want to go. Rather than responding defensively, listen closely to what's being said to gain a new outlook on your life. Incorporating other people's perspectives can be messy, but it is sometimes the most reliable path to personal growth."
gemini,2015-01-17,"Using your sarcastic sense of humor as a weapon may be inappropriate today. People close to you grow tired of your verbal sparring as a means to circumvent a more revealing conversation. Since others might not be in the mood for your sharp tongue now, they could just end the conversation abruptly, leaving you to wonder why. It's as simple as you make it; play nice if you don't want to play alone."
cancer,2015-01-17,"You're not enjoying your current role of being the one who reminds others to be responsible now. You might even try to avoid being the authority figure because you want to run away and have fun. You're tempted to act defiantly, but your best strategy is to keep your irritation to yourself today and take care of your chores. Don't be discouraged; you'll have time during the week to break free and be silly after your work is done."
leo,2015-01-17,"Although you're certain you can accomplish nearly anything you set your mind to now, you're still cautious about making commitments you can't keep. Your confidence is softened by a pervasive realism, preventing you from going overboard. But don't get too serious or you might miss an opportunity that's right in front of your nose. Stretch beyond your current comfort zone to reach for the stars."
virgo,2015-01-17,"Establishing emotional stability is a challenging task today because you're feeling restless. In fact, your goals probably remain just beyond your immediate grasp now. Paradoxically, when you get closer to your destination, you seem to subconsciously move it to someplace even further away. Your weird strategy isn't about productivity; it's simply your sneaky way to motivate yourself to cover a lot of new territory."
libra,2015-01-17,"Your current insecurity might lead you to make a wrong conclusion about someone you love. You're eager to do whatever it takes to be a part of a partnership, but it feels like someone is actually working against you for no apparent reason. Instead of continuing to try to create an emotional connection, chill out and back off just a bit. Once others have more room to breathe, they might be more willing to meet you halfway. Finding common ground is more likely in an atmosphere of mutual respect."
scorpio,2015-01-17,"You do not want to accept no as the final answer, so you might try again after rephrasing your question. Although you were initially hoping for a resolution today, there are still many shades of gray between the black and the white. Keep in mind that it may take a few more days until the outcome is clear. Don't rush the process or you could subsequently waste precious resources. If you decide to slow down, then time will be on your side."
sagittarius,2015-01-17,"Everything looks good on paper until you come to the sudden realization that you made a faulty assumption. It's not easy to decide what to do now that your philosophical reasoning can't rescue you from your current predicament. Instead of making a situation worse, do exactly what you should do when you get lost. Stop; don't go anywhere until you have regained your bearings. Ask for directions, if necessary, and then continue on your way with renewed confidence."
capricorn,2015-01-17,"Your natural single-mindedness drives you to finish a task before starting a new one. Unfortunately, the current circumstances may not be so accommodating and you could be forced to begin another project before you are ready. But don't be too quick to judge what's best for your future. Instead, let go of your expectations and just see what happens next. Sometimes, not having a plan set in stone enables you to make more out of an unexpected change of events. Flexibility is your friend."
aquarius,2015-01-17,"Setting your dreams on the front burner is a mixed blessing now. Although you may be walking on air as you share your plans for the future with your friends, you might be so excited that you soar dangerously high. Just remember that your exuberance could inadvertently set you up for failure. Balance your fantasies with your common sense; let your head drift up into the clouds, but keep both feet planted firmly on the ground."
pisces,2015-01-17,"You feel a sense of urgency today as your adrenaline levels climb, inspiring colorful visions of your great escape. You are impatient and want to break free from the past before you are forever stuck in it. Continue to explore every outrageous idea, especially the ones that will surprise everyone. But don't act before the time is right. Even if it's hard to wait, the experience will be more than worth it in the long run. Your imagination is where your dreams take root."
aries,2015-01-18,"You might think you need to hold back your feelings about your future plans so that you don't upset a tenuous situation. But it's time to realize that you aren't the center of everyone's attention now, even if you believe otherwise. However, you can't restrain your desires forever, so it's a smart idea to initiate a process of gradual self-expression. Start slowly to lessen the shock value. Give others time to absorb your words and reflect on them before you take your revelation to the next level."
taurus,2015-01-18,"Although you're typically quite practical, you might temporarily set common sense aside to undertake something that is a bit risky. Although your actions are still goal-oriented, you're less concerned about tangible accomplishments now and more focused on your dreams of success. Even if you have mixed feelings about what you are doing today, rest assured that it's okay to cut loose from your obligations for a while. You can return to your unfinished business with renewed vigor after the New Moon on Tuesday."
gemini,2015-01-18,"You're captivated by your dreams of globetrotting these days, but your yearnings for adventure won't be satisfied by a casual visit to a friend in a nearby city. Seriously consider going the distance now, like taking a trip to a place on your bucket list. Fly in your imagination to another galaxy or cruise in your time machine back to the Renaissance. Paradoxically, it doesn't matter whether or not you actually pack your bags and go as long as you allow yourself the luxury of traveling there in your mind."
cancer,2015-01-18,"You may be under growing pressure from someone close to you as Tuesday's New Moon draws near. The emotional stress is an indicator that something needs to change and a confrontation could be unavoidable. There are sensitive issues about intimacy that must be addressed. Whether you like it or not, withdrawing from an intense connection might not be your most intelligent course of action, especially if you're reacting on gut fear. Instead, find the courage to choose love as your guiding light and slowly establish healthier ways of relating to others."
leo,2015-01-18,"It feels like boredom is settling in and you are craving a change of scenery. But even if you are right at the edge of a big shift, you can't make things progress any faster than reality will allow. It's as if your speed limit is being set by external events, rather than by your own intent. Frustration can be a result of impatience, for the real transformation will take more time than you prefer. Keep the faith, there will be enough clues in the days ahead to foreshadow the next act of the play."
virgo,2015-01-18,"Although you might switch your attention to more playful activities, immediate pleasure may not be forthcoming. Even a simple romantic adventure could run into delays while you manage the logistics. Reality seems to get in the way of your enjoyment just enough to keep you aware of what you're missing. Don't give up; satisfaction is closer than you think. You can climb the tallest mountain with a good map, a solid plan and your unwavering determination."
libra,2015-01-18,"Sticking close to home may be all you need to feel emotionally secure today. However, you could still grow restless, motivating you to head out in search of new and different avenues for expressing your creativity. Don't worry about how your friends and family might react; the outcome is likely to pleasantly surprise you. Keep in mind that any negativity you encounter probably has its roots in envy. Take a chance and walk on the wild side, no matter what anyone else thinks."
scorpio,2015-01-18,"Oddly enough, you're chattier than usual, but you glean more meaning from life now if you look beneath the funny stories and clever repartee. Unfortunately, you could run into a wall when someone isn't amused by your penetrating questions. Don't try to charm your way through an awkward interaction. Instead, take the initiative and talk about the issues as you discover them. Your willingness to address a tough subject in a fair-minded manner will win the admiration of those who previously resisted your efforts."
sagittarius,2015-01-18,"Retail therapy is not usually an advisable path to happiness; however, there are times when spending money does feel good. Your current justification for making a purchase could be fabricated, especially if you want to take advantage of a bargain. It's worth taking some time to reconsider your actions. There's nothing wrong with buying a beautiful object; it's even better if the price is right. However, you don't need to stretch the truth to come up with false reasons for your self-indulgence. This is not about what anyone else likes; it's about acquiring something that touches your heart."
capricorn,2015-01-18,"You sense that your time to act is running out -- and, actually it is. It's natural to experience  a little anxiety and moodiness now that the sensitive Moon is back in your sign. Although other people don't necessarily comprehend your current angst, unfinished business can stand between you and your goals. Unless it's truly urgent, try not to start a new project until after Tuesday's New Moon. Reexamine recent events and tie up loose ends while you still have the chance."
aquarius,2015-01-18,"Old feelings run their course tonight and then they mellow out before returning to the cosmic recycling bin. Still, you are not yet ready to transition into the next emotional cycle. Instead of planting a new crop of ideas in the garden of your imagination, think about the importance of the compost pile where today's psychological garbage magically transforms into tomorrow's healthy soil. Be patient and allow the process to evolve at its own pace."
pisces,2015-01-18,"Spending quality time with people who recognize your true self is certainly good for the soul. Group activities take up more of your life now that the Moon is camping out in your 11th House of Social Networking. However, your real challenge is to keep some energy in reserve to meet your emotional needs and those of your family. Don't make foolish commitments in situations that aren't fully connected to your heart. Acting with integrity keeps your intentions clearly transparent to everyone involved."
aries,2015-01-19,"You really don't want to explain every decision you make today because you believe that logic isn't always the most important factor. Talking about your choices now can actually detract from your experience; you prefer to focus on the present moment and simply follow your intuition. Thankfully, you don't need anyone's approval for what you are feeling. However, it never hurts to run your plan past someone reliable before you swing into action. A little objectivity is your secret to success."
taurus,2015-01-19,"You might have a set plan in mind for how the day should unfold, but you can't expect others to be able to read your thoughts. It makes more sense to climb out on a limb and let someone close to you know what you want now. But even if you share your hopes, you still may be misinterpreted if a friend or relative makes an incorrect assumption about your intentions. Taking sufficient time to clearly explain your motives today could be enough to prevent headaches for everyone involved. Tread carefully until the fog lifts tomorrow."
gemini,2015-01-19,"You have very specific emotional needs today, yet it's tricky to find the right words to convey them. To complicate matters further, it's all too easy to imagine the worst because your dreams are overflowing into the real world, making it nearly impossible to separate illusion from reality. Thankfully, struggling to discern the truth isn't necessary if you are willing to allow fact and fiction to exist side by side. Luckily, dreams really can come true."
cancer,2015-01-19,"Your natural sensitivity to the feelings of those around you is a lot to handle today if you get into a disagreement with someone close to you. Your resistance to change only adds to the confusion, especially if you're afraid of losing your sense of identity. Fortunately, you can capitalize on the gentle Mars-Neptune conjunction by consciously softening your stance while still maintaining your current position. Others will quickly pick up on your change of attitude, paving the way for cooperation rather than conflict."
leo,2015-01-19,"Hiding your emotional intensity isn't usually a viable strategy because feelings gain power when they are suppressed. Nevertheless, the Moon's short-lived conjunction with controlling Pluto may provoke a melodramatic meltdown. However, if you are frustrated by certain people's inability to do their jobs, losing your temper clears the air of pent-up tension. Thankfully, an apology goes a long way now, especially if your words sounded excessively harsh. Keeping the drama to a minimum today saves you from future regret."
virgo,2015-01-19,"Don't be so certain that you know what's happening because your reality filter may not be working all that well today. You might have enough stars in your eyes now to prevent you from seeing what's right in front of you. There are specific tasks that need to be done, but your lack of focus makes staying on track nearly impossible. Nevertheless, there's no reason to be self-judgmental; just do the best you can and pick up where you left off when your concentration returns. Let your imagination wander but wait until tomorrow before taking matters into your own hands."
libra,2015-01-19,"You may feel as if you've stepped into a world of paradox today. The veil between this world and others is thinner than usual, but you're also quite attached to your creature comforts while pleasure-seeking Venus opposes excessive Jupiter. Don't resist the flow of images that arise from your imagination, even if you can't understand what they mean. Thankfully, there's nothing special you have to do now, except listen closely to the messages from beyond while continuing to meet your mundane commitments."
scorpio,2015-01-19,"You can tell that your inner landscape is undergoing dramatic psychological change for the better. Although your key planet Pluto is touched by the evocative Moon this morning, other cosmic influences keep the energy steadily moving toward the light. This is an opportunity to step into the shadows, dredge up the past and then let the spiritual process do its magic. You may be exploring unfamiliar ground, but the personal transformation you are experiencing is perfectly safe."
sagittarius,2015-01-19,"You might be hesitant to place too many expectations on current events, yet you're still feeling quite optimistic about your future prospects. There's nothing wrong with wanting more from life as long as you can avoid obsessing over the idea of success. Your adaptability makes the difference between frustration and happiness. Activate your imagination and dream big; just give reality enough wiggle room to unfold with a few surprises."
capricorn,2015-01-19,"There seems to be a lot at stake today and you're tempted to take extreme action to turn the tide in your favor. However, micromanaging emotional tension can backfire if you fall short of keeping up with all the complex interactions. Maintaining control over too many variables is a study in frustration. However, loosening the reins a bit deepens your connections with those you love, which ironically, will also make you more productive in the long run."
aquarius,2015-01-19,"A bubble of rainbows and unicorns might be all you need now to protect your dreamy confidence from intrusions by reality. Luckily, your imagination is the wellspring of your future. However, Jupiter's opposition to sweet Venus in your sign makes everything look better than it is and can set you up for disappointment. You're able to make the best of both worlds by following your fantasies while also maintaining contact with the world around you. Dancing in two realms is possible if you're willing to pay attention to both."
pisces,2015-01-19,"You have an eye on the distant horizon now as you consider the vast array of possibilities ahead. Your current need to redefine your goals intensifies as you learn more about the politics of current events in your life. However, you may be driven more by your fascination with a fantasy today than by a realistic goal. An illusory Mars-Neptune hookup can steer you toward a lovely but unattainable vision or toward the creative manifestation of a dream. Make your choice an informed one to increase your chances for success."
aries,2015-01-20,"Everything in your world seems to be saying yes while, oddly enough, your mind is telling you to wait. Meanwhile, the quirky Aquarius New Moon enlivens your 11th House of Friends, so you could still have fun even if you don't make a lot of progress today. Remember, your current self-restraint works in your favor as long as you don't confuse everyone with your mixed messages. Make a game plan and stick with your chosen course of action no matter what. Your uncharacteristic tenacity earns you respect."
taurus,2015-01-20,"Although you may be determined to achieve success on your own terms, you're not prepared to jeopardize your job security. Today's Aquarius New Moon fortifies your 10th House of Public Responsibility, encouraging you to find a way to fulfill your obligations without sacrificing your freedom. Thankfully, you can act independently while also playing it safe. Taking a calculated risk doesn't require you to completely break away from your familiar routines. You won't go wrong if you have logic on your side."
gemini,2015-01-20,"Your mind is crackling with the sparks of unconventional thoughts as the ingenious Aquarius New Moon activates your 9th House of Big Ideas. Although your current philosophy may be an impractical one, you can still communicate your perspective with such insistence that others will sit up and listen. However, your words might require extra time to sink in because your key planet Mercury is slowing down to a crawl today. Don't try to prove that you're right; instead, focus on the process and not on the destination."
cancer,2015-01-20,You might have to deal with someone who tries to avoid a deep emotional discussion today but the intellectual intensity of the Aquarius New Moon brightens your 8th House of Deep Sharing and you refuse to give up easily. You are quite serious about being heard now and won't let a conversation end until you believe that your message is understood. But don't worry too much if you fall short of creating a real connection yet as long as you maintain your integrity.
leo,2015-01-20,"It's all too easy to make a sincere promise because your relationship intentions are crystal clear now that the Aquarius New Moon falls in your 7th House of Others. Nevertheless, it's challenging to follow through with an action plan that makes your heart happy. Don't let unexpected delays upset you today; change will come but you can't rush the process. In the meantime, start visualizing the dynamics of your ideal partnership since your imagination is where the future begins."
virgo,2015-01-20,"There is nothing wrong with trying a radical new approach to solve a problem at work as long as you think your plan all the way through first. Today's Aquarius New Moon's presence in your 6th House of Work is a mixed blessing; you want to fulfill your responsibilities but you don't want to do everything the same old way. Although you may dazzle your peers with your brilliance, don't get so carried away with your current idea that you forget about a reliable method that's already proven successful in the past. Blend the old with the new for the best results."
libra,2015-01-20,"You may need to overcome your own inertia if you want to show the world your true colors. Today's Aquarius New Moon triggers a creative cycle as it highlights your 5th House of Self-Expression. You could encounter some challenging resistance now, but your current persistence and undeniable charm enable you to win support from those who can help you the most. Although it might take longer than you expect to complete what you start, this is still your best chance to push for what you want."
scorpio,2015-01-20,"Although you are interested in getting ahead on the job, you also wish you had more time for your home and family life now. Today's conceptual Aquarius New Moon occurs in your 4th House of Foundations, focusing your needs on the basics. Even if you're required to meet social and career obligations, gradually releasing your attachment to other people's expectations gives you more time to attend to personal issues. Setting priorities isn't always easy, but the current process helps you to decide what is most important for your future."
sagittarius,2015-01-20,"You may be busier than ever today because your life is packed with a variety of things to do and people to see -- setting an exciting tone for the next few weeks. The electric Aquarius New Moon energizes your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, distracting you with one amazing idea after another. However, this is your chance to be strategic in your planning and complete as many unfinished projects as you can now. Free up as much time as possible so you're able to jump into the next wave of opportunities with a clear conscience."
capricorn,2015-01-20,"You have a strong desire to shake up your approach to your personal finances while today's radical Aquarius New Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Money. Although this is an excellent time to initiate new fiscal practices that strengthen your credibility, nothing will happen overnight. Big changes are possible if you're not in too much of a hurry during messenger Mercury's retrograde three-week cycle. You might want to consider meeting with a professional who can help you create a practical budget. Minimize problems down the road by assuming full responsibility for your actions now."
aquarius,2015-01-20,"Although you can see the benefit of clarifying your needs, sudden mood swings may conflict with your normal intellectual approach. The Aquarius New Moon highlights your 1st House of Self, empowering you to set your intentions quickly and move in an entirely new direction. Your dreams are so real now that you are tempted to treat them as the truth. Instead, honor the symbols that arise from the depths of your subconscious without taking any direct action yet. Patience is your friend; you'll know in your heart when it's time to put your ideas into motion."
pisces,2015-01-20,"The most significant events in your life are now occurring in realms beyond the three-dimensional world. Today's Aquarius New Moon stimulates your 12th House of Divine Inspiration, downloading visions of a more spiritual existence. Happily, your imagination holds the keys to your future. But don't attempt to rationalize your creative bursts of energy; instead, just allow your fantasies to flow freely without doing anything about them. With a gentle nudge in the right direction, your dreams will become more integrated with your everyday life."
aries,2015-01-21,"Even the best-laid plans may fall apart while trickster Mercury retrogrades through your 11th House of Community over the next three weeks. It's no fun to discover that you made two social commitments for the same time and will have to let someone down. Or maybe you are forced to reconsider your long-term goals due to a lack of support from others. No matter what happens, don't try to power your way through the change of circumstances. A surprise can give you an opportunity to shine if you have the right attitude. Work with the energy, not against it."
taurus,2015-01-21,"Career objectives are overdue for reconsideration but you don't have to make a final decision today. Mercury's three-week retrograde in your 10th House of Public Responsibility kicks off a serious reevaluation of your professional aspirations. Keep in mind that this review is an extended process and not a one-day affair. No matter which path you choose, you won't be satisfied if you try to sprint to the finish, only to exhaust yourself before reaching your final destination. Pace yourself for the best results."
gemini,2015-01-21,"Your political opinions might be up for debate, but rather than defending your ideas, try keeping an open mind instead. It's not that you should blindly adopt a point of view different from yours. Just use this Mercury retrograde in your 9th House of Higher Truth to reassess your overall philosophy of life and then make sure your position on each specific issue supports your belief system. If you are consistent in your thinking, you won't likely be faulted for your perspective, whether or not you agree with anyone else. Showing respect for others encourages them to do the same."
cancer,2015-01-21,"You could feel misunderstood after taking a risk and baring your soul to a trusted friend or companion. Faulty assumptions might increase the gulf even further if you try to talk it out. Mercury turns retrograde in your 8th House of Intimacy today, so the more you say and the harder you push for resolution, the more the distance seems to grow. However, talking about your emotions after they settle down helps the other person assimilate your message without any complications. Timing is everything."
leo,2015-01-21,"Interpersonal dynamics are bent out of shape today as messenger Mercury turns retrograde in your 7th House of Significant Others. Unfortunately, using the silent treatment isn't a very effective way to resolve an argument. Thankfully, you have the capability to pull magical words out of the air as long as they are in harmony with your actions. Still, a final solution may not be forthcoming, even with the best of intentions. No matter how much you believe in your message now, patience is still your most powerful secret weapon."
virgo,2015-01-21,"If you recently made resolutions to improve your lifestyle, you might realize that you're on the verge of slipping or, perhaps, you have already missed your target. Mercury's retrograde turn in your 6th House of Habits could bring three weeks of a reversion to the past. Don't judge your shortcomings as if it were a final exam. You are as human as everyone else. Cut yourself some slack, make a plan to get back on track and don't give up. Focus on what you can do right instead of where you went wrong."
libra,2015-01-21,"A romantic relationship may run into troubled waters now that mischievous Mercury is retrograding through your 5th House of Love. Something you said recently can come back to haunt you. But rather than slipping into denial, it's much healthier to acknowledge your words whether you meant them or not. Keep in mind that a similar discussion might pop up a few times over the next few weeks until the issue is finally put to rest. Revisiting a previous conversation with someone special could be all that's needed to restore peace and calm to your life."
scorpio,2015-01-21,"It might not matter how many times you go over the details on a project at home; Mercury's retrograde through your 4th House of Domestic Conditions may still reveal more loose ends. However, there's no time to get flustered even if the scope of your plans are larger and more complicated than you thought. Just take it one single step at a time. If you don't try to rush the final outcome, the cosmic power remains on your side. Hang in there and trust the process."
sagittarius,2015-01-21,"You're easily distracted by someone's ingenious idea, whether or not it has practical merit. Unfortunately, you might commit resources to a job that ends up being a waste of your time. Mental Mercury turns retrograde in your 3rd House of Communication today, prompting you to jump to an erroneous conclusion. Reducing everything to its simplest terms is a wise strategy. Searching for the truth is a noble cause and might surprise you with what it reveals."
capricorn,2015-01-21,"You bring more to the table than you realize, but it might require some time before others acknowledge your value while Mercury retrogrades through your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Fortunately, you don't have to wait for recognition before doing what you do best. In the long run, you will be appreciated for your ability to organize complex systems and make concrete plans. Just remember that your dogged determination will ultimately lead you to the success you seek."
aquarius,2015-01-21,"It is the best of times and the worst of times as clever Mercury turns retrograde in community-minded Aquarius. Communication takes center stage as you engage with others who can help you achieve success. However, it's tempting to say too much or push the limits of a conversation too far, negating the positive gains already made. Your sense of urgency is based upon unnecessary fears. Give yourself more time before responding to an important phone call or hitting send on an email to someone who may hold a key to your future. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
pisces,2015-01-21,"Although you normally take your dreams to heart, Mercury's current retrograde in your 12th House of Spiritual Mysteries warps the information you receive from the imaginal realms. Ironically, your instincts might not be so reliable now. Fortunately, it's easy to delay a response that's based on an intuitive hunch. Taking a few deep breaths while you reconsider your intended action is a great idea. But it's even smarter to run a decision by a trusted friend today. A little objective feedback at a critical time never hurt anyone."
aries,2015-01-22,"Although you might be able to commune with your inner warrior today, it isn't easy to follow through with definitive action. Paradoxically, you might feel overwhelmed, even if you're motivated to take charge of the changes in your life. If you can't decide where to begin, relax and give yourself permission to drift without direction for a while. Fortunately, there is no immediate pressure to find you way yet because you'll regain your bearings naturally by next week. Not all those who wander are lost."
taurus,2015-01-22,"Your friends are annoying today if they don't deliver on their promises. You may grow frustrated with their unreliability, but it won't likely be severe enough to provoke your wrath. Accept full responsibility for your emotions by depending less on others and taking more initiative on your own. Thankfully, if you are walking your talk now, you'll have a deep well of strength upon which to draw. Give others the same room to make mistakes that you would want in return."
gemini,2015-01-22,"Making up your mind seems nearly impossible today, even if you thought you were sure of your position. Nevertheless, if you know what is best for you, you may be reconsidering a previous decision now. Although you take pride in your adaptable nature, someone else could view your fickle behavior as counterproductive. However, don't worry about what anyone else currently thinks. Just give others the same consideration if they choose to change their minds, too. Set an example by taking care of your business in harmony with the shifting tides."
cancer,2015-01-22,"The heightened intensity of your emotions makes you feel rejuvenated today because it puts you in touch with an endless supply of energy. You're highly motivated to act on your passions now, instead of just reflecting on them. It's not your problem if you make someone feel uncomfortable when following your heart. Even if you usually tend to take the most cautious route, letting loose is a good exercise for your soul."
leo,2015-01-22,"Your inner reality may be in conflict with external circumstances as a tricky situation reaches a climax today. You could even temporarily lose your temper, but the results of an uncontrolled emotional outburst won't make anyone happier. Find less extreme ways in which to communicate your needs and others will be more likely to listen. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."
virgo,2015-01-22,"It's no fun being bossed around by a coworker who isn't as efficient or clever as you, and today you're not willing to do all the work while someone else gets the credit. Fortunately, there is no need to do anything drastic that might draw unwanted attention to yourself. If you continue to pursue your goals and honor your work ethic, others will eventually appreciate your unique contribution. The only judge who really matters is you."
libra,2015-01-22,"You could work all day without looking up, yet it might seem as if you're not making any progress at all. However, your relentless effort and unwavering hope combine to produce an unbeatable strategy now. Set aside all traces of discouragement, since you are probably much closer to the finish line than you realize. And, thankfully, once you reach your destination, your peers will acknowledge all that you have accomplished along the way. In the meantime, taking pride in your work serves you well."
scorpio,2015-01-22,"Physical expression is critical today while the evocative Moon runs into passionate Mars, flooding you with excess energy. Unfortunately, your words may not convey the intensity of your feelings, so a discussion, however heated, might leave you in a state of frustration. If possible, save the conversation until the atmosphere is less volatile. Fortunately, taking a brisk walk or working out at the gym will help to break up the tension and settle your nerves."
sagittarius,2015-01-22,"You might be confused about your beliefs today, but your uncertainty may not be observable by anyone else. Thankfully, your unexpected dilemma could prompt you to delve deep to question the relationship between your personal goals and the overall purpose of your soul. Don't push for all the answers now; just be honest about your feelings, even if you're not yet sure where they are taking you. Making the most of this spiritual journey is more important than actually reaching your destination."
capricorn,2015-01-22,"You may feel like a winner today and capable of fighting like a champ, if necessary. Your strength of conviction emboldens you to take a stand for something that's especially meaningful to you. However, it's crucial to pick your battles carefully since it's not healthy to waste energy over unimportant ego skirmishes where no one comes out ahead. Don't pursue open conflict; you can accomplish so much more with cooperation than combat."
aquarius,2015-01-22,"There isn't a quick fix to an ongoing financial problem, although prudent action can have a very positive impact on your circumstances now. Fortunately, your current money dilemma has a real solution if you are willing to get serious and apply your undivided attention to the situation at hand. Luckily, you could benefit greatly from a smart plan and a strong commitment. Take your time, set clear priorities and act with fierce intention."
pisces,2015-01-22,"There is a big difference between your self-perception and how someone else perceives you today. You might believe that you're responding to a developing situation in a perfectly normal manner. However, your reactions are swifter and stronger than usual, possibly causing other people to think that you're applying unnecessary force. Minimize the current tension by softening your position and lowering the volume of your voice. Exhibiting a flexible attitude and a positive disposition reduces the intensity all the way around."
aries,2015-01-23,"If you're seduced by the beauty of your pipe dreams today, confronting an inescapable fact may pull you back into the real world faster than you can imagine. You might not like what you learn, but denying the information won't make it go away. Your persistence won't be enough to avoid a situation that demands your attention now. Seek a creative solution instead of trying to jump over the hurdle. Willingly admitting that you don't have an answer to every question can reopen the very same doors that you thought were closed."
taurus,2015-01-23,"Although you wish your social life was flowing easily now, resistance to your plans may be too intense to ignore. But instead of just giving up, reconsider your basic assumptions and then explore as many options as possible to reach your goals. The issues that are coming to the surface are not really obstacles; they are lessons. Use your common sense when thinking about your next move. Talking about your aspirations could kick off a discussion that ultimately reveals a real solution that you hadn't previously considered."
gemini,2015-01-23,"You can usually think fast on your feet, but today you may feel as if you're losing your edge as you try to create a plan to get ahead at work. You might believe that you discovered a brilliant solution, only to be stuck over the execution. Oddly enough, keeping busy every minute isn't in your best interest now. Stepping back and scheduling time to analyze the situation can be just the catalyst you need to figure out where you went wrong. Failure is the highway to success."
cancer,2015-01-23,"Someone may rain on your parade today, or you might just feel a lack of support from a person who usually encourages your efforts. However, a minor setback doesn't indicate defeat. A challenge tests you to see if you have the fortitude to stand up to the current resistance. However, it's a mistake to act in a defensive manner before you consider what can be done to improve your plan. You are given a chance to get it right now, so be sure to take every opportunity that comes your way to prove your competence."
leo,2015-01-23,"You know you're on the correct path today, yet you can't escape relationship issues that still raise temporary self-doubt. You might begin to question the logic of your thinking if something significant happens now that isn't part of your well-constructed master plan. Narrowing your focus and finishing up old business accomplishes a lot more than chasing dreams. Leave your long-term goals for another day; keep bringing your attention back to the practical realities of the present moment where the rubber meets the road."
virgo,2015-01-23,"Unrealistic dreams may crash down to earth today as you try to get a handle on these tumultuous times. Although you might be dazed and confused by your recent trip down Memory Lane, the planetary energy supports your efforts to build a solid foundation. Don't give up prematurely; instead, modify your plans based upon your current experience and then try again. Your relentless pursuit of perfection at work enables you to figure out the right direction now and then navigate your way until your path becomes more certain."
libra,2015-01-23,"Although you're often comfortable sitting on the fence, the Sun's cooperative sextile to taskmaster Saturn will likely push you one way or the other today. Unfortunately, you still may regret your decision, no matter which direction you choose. Weigh all the options carefully before making up your mind, but postpone making your final choice until you can't put it off any longer. Your ability to remain adaptable is a strength, since circumstances could require you to change your plans within a few days, anyhow. Fortunately, you can still be serious-minded while being light on your feet."
scorpio,2015-01-23,"You may feel as if you're witnessing a changing of the guards; one shift is ending, but another one is ready to begin. Although you can see the positive potential ahead, you're not comfortable with all aspects of the transition. You might even think about leaving your troubles behind and retreating into your own private world today. Remember, there is a very fine line between seeking solitude to regroup and hiding from reality to escape from your responsibilities. Either way, meditating on the difference brings clarification when you need it most."
sagittarius,2015-01-23,"Someone might attempt to convince you to handle a stressful interpersonal dynamic now, but you may prefer to sidestep this kind of unpleasant business. Unfortunately, there's no way to talk your way out of the conflict because you must get to the bottom of the current tension before moving on. Thankfully, your worries are worse than the outcome and your inspired presence can lead to greener pastures. Create new ways to work through old patterns that might otherwise hold you back."
capricorn,2015-01-23,"You could be flooded with facts that require you to address the limitations of your current approach to managing your daily life. You know the old ways are not working anymore, but you don't have a new plan in mind yet. You might feel as if you're standing between two worlds without a sensible strategy. Although your previous assumptions are still intact, you must replace them with a newer paradigm. Step outside of the box; lateral thinking strengthens your chances of success."
aquarius,2015-01-23,"Indulging in fantasies today motivates you to reach beyond your comfort zone, but you might set your goals so high that you won't be able to attain them. It is healthy to acknowledge that your dreams are so fantastic that reality doesn't even have a chance to live up to them. Nevertheless, you can outmaneuver negativity now by graciously accepting what happens, even if it doesn't match your wildest expectations. Realistically assessing your current resources is the first step to achieving your ambitions."
pisces,2015-01-23,"You might believe that you have found a workable solution to a lingering problem, only to recognize you don't have enough time or energy to execute your plan today. However, eliminating extraneous distractions from your life increases your happiness and improves your chances for success. It's much easier to make thoughtful cutbacks now than it will be once you're already in motion and under pressure. Taking preemptive action places you on a positive track."
aries,2015-01-24,"You're highly motivated to inform everyone of your feelings today, but your radical honesty could backfire unless you're gentle in your delivery. Nothing will be gained if you scare people off before they hear what you have to say. Luckily, your day improves dramatically if you soften your rhetoric just a notch. Although your impatience makes taking it easy nearly impossible now, slowing down helps you to sustain your positive attitude."
taurus,2015-01-24,"You might feel quite hopeful about getting some much-needed rest and relaxation, but this weekend may bring more action than you prefer. You could be pulled into someone's emotional drama today, but you don't have to get fully involved unless you want to participate. At first, it's challenging to resist taking the bait, but it's smarter to keep quiet before you find yourself in over your head. Thankfully, others will most likely respect your boundaries as long as you're honest about your motives right from the start."
gemini,2015-01-24,"Ironically, you will discover a new direction to take once you make a real commitment to finish whatever is already on your plate. Unfortunately, it may not be all that easy to concentrate now because you long to jump into the next distraction as soon as it comes your way. Leave plenty of time to fulfill your responsibilities today, even if your friends tempt you with intriguing alternatives. Setting priorities is the secret to your success."
cancer,2015-01-24,"There's no reason to conform to people's narrow expectations today just because they assume you want to stay home, comfortable in your shell. Your current adventurous streak may surprise everyone when you spontaneously head out to do something exciting on your own now without even discussing your plans with anyone else. You don't have to seek approval for your decisions or offer lengthy rationalizations for your actions; just spread your wings and fly."
leo,2015-01-24,"Although you may not be completely free to do anything you want today, it's still healthy to make some special plans for the immediate future. You can derive much enjoyment from simply dreaming up something wonderful, even if the opportunity to escape hasn't arrived yet. In the meantime, think on a large scale. The feisty Aries Moon activates your 9th House of Adventure, setting the stage for a mind-expanding experience. It's wise to consider an array of alternatives while you have the cosmic forces in your corner."
virgo,2015-01-24,"There's a lot of commotion around you today, making you feel nervous if you think that you might become uprooted from your secure place in the world. Alternatively, relinquishing control might prove to be exhilarating, assuming you can find the courage to go on an emotional joyride. Thankfully, you will probably end up in better shape than you started in, so say yes to an invitation for fun before the opportunity passes. You only live once."
libra,2015-01-24,"Defending your position might be necessary this weekend, especially if you feel your emotional security is tied up with the need to protect yourself. You don't have to go too far out of your way and waste energy trying to be nice if anyone acts disrespectfully toward you. Although you may startle others if you push back to make your point, no one has the right to be overly bossy or take advantage of your good nature. Standing up for yourself will earn you new respect and appreciation from someone you admire."
scorpio,2015-01-24,"Losing your temper over something that may ultimately be unimportant can add a simple twist of fate to your day. Your perspective is slightly warped now by your heightened sense of urgency, but acknowledging you are more impatient than usual helps you manage your feelings more effectively. Count to ten before making your move; giving yourself enough time to reestablish your emotional center of gravity might be the most effective way to stay out of trouble."
sagittarius,2015-01-24,"Keeping the lid on your feelings is not a good idea today. It's wiser to let them out gradually, rather than waiting until they explode at the wrong time. You aren't doing anyone any favors by bottling up your emotions because they will just continue to intensify out of your control. Act consciously by discussing your concerns objectively, instead of throwing a tantrum later on. Find a kind way to share your perspective without losing your cool in the process. Sometimes it's better to whisper than to shout."
capricorn,2015-01-24,"You won't have to go too far to discover something new and different now. The excitable Aries Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family indicates that adventure could find you wherever you are. Even if you don't think you need an extra adrenaline rush, you probably won't be able to resist the opportunity when it presents itself. Whether you asked for it or not, another round of good times is knocking at your door, so be a gracious host and let it in."
aquarius,2015-01-24,"You might be looking for a quick getaway and this weekend could be perfect for escaping to a special place. Don't let previous plans stress you out because you should be able to put your obligations on temporary hold. Naturally, you'll need to return to unfinished chores, but in the interim, relax and enjoy your mini-retreat. Being creative with your schedule now will leave you in a revitalized state of mind for a busy week ahead."
pisces,2015-01-24,"Your current confidence makes all the difference between a quiet day that comes and goes without much notice and a memorable one that is made for the record books. The self-directed Aries Moon emboldens your 2nd House of Self-Worth, empowering you to take responsibility for whatever you do now. This isn't the time to hand the reins of control over to anyone else; instead, decide exactly where you want to go and then create your itinerary to carry you safely to your desired destination. Believing in yourself is the first step on your journey."
aries,2015-01-25,"There's no holding you back today; your enthusiasm feeds on itself and takes you along for the ride. However, your positive attitude sets you up for disappointment if you think you can accomplish more than is humanly possible. The spontaneous Aries Moon prompts impulsive behavior and you might as well go with it now. Even if you don't reach your destination right away, there is always tomorrow. You can all but ensure your long-term success by persistently working toward your goal."
taurus,2015-01-25,"You may be lost in an unrealistic fantasy today as the Moon activates your 12th House of Fantasy, triggering dreams about your future. Unfortunately, your mental meanderings aren't likely grounded in your life experiences. Still, it's not helpful to be too self-critical as you willingly loosen the reins on reality. Having a practical plan in place isn't as crucial now as stretching your creativity. Innovative thinking leads to new opportunities, so explore every possibility before choosing your direction."
gemini,2015-01-25,"You could grow tired of being responsible, so you're poised to let go of practical restraints today in order to go along with someone else's plan. Stepping away from a leadership position means you don't have to worry about the outcome. You're willing to give nearly anyone the benefit of the doubt now because you can see the potential good wherever you look. Fortunately, you don't have to produce concrete results, so just enjoy your little escape and see where others take you."
cancer,2015-01-25,"You are willing to participate in activities with friends and relatives today because you believe they will accept you without asking too many questions. You don't want to explain everything you do and are happy that you can keep your thoughts to yourself for now. Ironically, you may become more comfortable sharing an original idea once others acknowledge your need for privacy. But you could regret saying more than you intended so don't lower your guard completely. Luckily, you still can reach your goals without revealing your vulnerability."
leo,2015-01-25,"If you are pushing forward without a solid strategy in place, you might soon realize that you need more than just a great idea. Your electric thoughts are lighting up your imagination, but you wont be able to make practical use of your brilliance unless you filter out the excess noise. You can't pursue every whim that pops into your head. A touch of self-restraint will ultimately enable you to get your life back under control. Saying yes to a new possibility is empowering but applying the brakes on the adrenaline rush might be your ticket to success."
virgo,2015-01-25,"You might encounter obstacles today as you attempt to turn your plans into decisive action. Your self-confidence may waver now that intellectual Mercury is backpedaling in your 6th House of Details. But you aren't willing to give up as you create one ingenious idea after another. Unfortunately, clever thinking doesn't necessarily lead to success. Instead of wasting your energy chasing illusions, your wisest move now is to say no when it's in your best interest."
libra,2015-01-25,"You believe you're communicating clearly today, but others may not understand your message. They could even become increasingly confused the more you talk if you gloss over important details without even realizing it. Mercury's retrograde in your 5th House of Self-Expression means you're inclined to speak without listening, and your expectations could be out of sync with the current circumstances. Instead of telling people what you want today, ask them what they need. Everyone is happier when there is a fair share of give and take."
scorpio,2015-01-25,"It might feel as if unforeseen situations at work are running the show now. Luckily, your confidence isn't suffering because interesting people continue to show up with uplifting ideas and promises of fun. Nevertheless, you're quickly tiring of what seems to be more talk than action. Ultimately, the power of your positive thinking will prevail, even if progress takes a while to manifest. Patience is your friend."
sagittarius,2015-01-25,"Although your current plans start out inspirational, they can become a weight you must bear if you inflate an idea so big now that it's becomes impossible to manage. Instead of confidently assuming you can do anything today, scale back your expectations and hit an easy target, rather than aiming so high you fall short. However, don't let negativity rule your choices. Making practicality your guiding principle fixes problems before they happen."
capricorn,2015-01-25,"You may be worrying obsessively about an unfinished project that continues to elude completion. Your dissatisfaction with the delay could escalate into anxiety as lingering tasks prevent you from obtaining full closure now. Instead of pretending that everything is fine and your work is all done, remain open to modifying your deadlines as needed. Setting realistic goals will help to settle your nerves and bring temporary relief from the stress."
aquarius,2015-01-25,"Your mind is working on overdrive sifting through all the facts now, but reality supplies them to you faster than you can process them. You're so wired that your excitement prompts you to jump to conclusions today; however, even your finest logic may be based on an erroneous assumption if you're not careful. Take your time and do things right. Instead of setting yourself up for failure by creating panic-inducing deadlines, establish thoughtful guidelines that can keep you on track."
pisces,2015-01-25,"If you recently made a commitment to a friend or relative, you might have to reconsider your promise today. But this isn't about avoiding responsibility; in fact, demonstrating your integrity by addressing your concerns now instead of waiting until it's too late is the right thing to do. There is plenty of room for improvement, especially if you face a minor setback. Nevertheless, there's no need to focus on failure; just clarify your intentions and move forward with an open heart."
aries,2015-01-26,"You may be restless today if your desires aren't being completely satisfied. Although relaxing while you have the chance is usually a good idea, you prefer excitement rather than the peace and quiet you are offered. There's no doubt that life would be simpler for all involved if you could just settle your energy, but denying your feelings only makes matters worse. Do yourself a favor and let others know what you want without making any unreasonable demands. Speaking your truth is appreciated more than you might think."
taurus,2015-01-26,"There are undercurrents of unspoken feelings that can hijack a conversation before it even gets off the ground. Unfortunately, your friends and relatives may not be listening carefully enough now to fully understand your message. Even if it seems as if you're being heard, others are only glimpsing a part of the picture. Being patient works to your advantage, for you can inadvertently push someone away by sharing too much, too fast. You can't go wrong if you unfold your story one step at a time and allow your audience a chance to take it all in."
gemini,2015-01-26,"You are better off saying less today because your words might end up misrepresenting your true intentions. Rather than relying on your quick wit, open your senses to direct impressions and act on your perceptions. Don't bother rationalizing your choices or justifying your gut feelings that lead you toward a particular destination. Listen to your instincts; you can always fill in the details afterward. Follow your heart now and not your head."
cancer,2015-01-26,"Your network of friends and acquaintances is a source of great stability and inspiration today, so listen closely to any advice they are willing to give. Although you're not required to follow anyone's lead, others offer practical approaches that could help you handle a sticky situation. Lingering self-doubt won't magically disappear, so be gentle now when judging yourself against your own heightened expectations. Contrary to your current worries, there isn't a hurry when it comes to untangling the mystery that is you."
leo,2015-01-26,"You're uncertain about a significant choice you must make now, but rest assured there isn't any one single path that's clearly right or wrong. Whatever you currently decide, your route will be a circuitous one and the detours will teach you lessons that you might have missed by zipping along unimpeded. Don't take yourself so seriously; you will have a very different perspective on what happened when you look back in a couple of months. Maintaining a healthy sense of humor saves the day."
virgo,2015-01-26,"You may feel a sense of relief because you see a friend or partner in a more realistic light today. You're comforted by the realization that you can make concrete decisions based on what you know, rather than flying by the seat of your pants. However, it's still wise to act with caution because you could miss crucial information that catches you off guard if you become too complacent. No one knows better than you that it never hurts to pay extra attention to the subtle nuances and the pesky details."
libra,2015-01-26,"Trusting those closest to you helps to reduce your current confusion about your work plans for next week. Thankfully, you are in an excellent position to turn any lack of clarity in your favor if you're not too eager to change everything all at once. Today's lesson is about letting go of control, so roll with the incoming waves without resistance. Having a flexible agenda is more important now than proving the strength of your willpower. Your willingness to compromise comes in handy when you need it the most."
scorpio,2015-01-26,"Karmic forces are at play behind the scenes, making or breaking a potential romance. The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Partners, combined with several planets chilling in your 5th House of Love, is a powerful energetic mix that blasts open your heart or increases your awareness of your desires. Thankfully, there's no need to push for the resolution of a relationship issue now; instead, just allow the current events to unfold without adding pressure to the situation. Giving deep feelings a day or two to work their way to the surface may be enough to change the game."
sagittarius,2015-01-26,"You prefer doing your chores the same way you've done them in the past now that the Moon has settled into your 6th House of Habits. Although you might have your methodology all figured out, your coworkers have a different agenda in mind for you. There's no need to stir up any resentment from others today; acknowledge those who are in charge and work with them rather than against them. You can accomplish more if you're willing to compromise and save your battles for another day when there are more important matters at stake."
capricorn,2015-01-26,"You are a wellspring of innovative ideas when it comes to new ways of making money, but it might seem as if your timing is slightly off. Nevertheless, you can still make solid progress today, even if you underestimate the amount of time needed to complete a project. Methodical Saturn's influence is strong now, making it possible to achieve your goals as long as you don't take any shortcuts. There may be more exciting strategies later on, but for now playing it safe is your most reliable route to success."
aquarius,2015-01-26,"You could sidestep unnecessary trouble today by remembering that you can't possibly have all the answers to every question. Although this warning might sound unnecessary, a momentary glimpse of awareness can be dangerous if it tricks you into believing that you understand more than you really do. Nevertheless, your mind is able to grasp complex mental relationships if you give it the chance. Instead of impulsively acting on your assumptions, reconsider all the facts from the ever-changing perspective of now."
pisces,2015-01-26,"Magic follows you around today, yet this intangible buzz can grow annoying if you try to establish direct correlations between your actions and your goals. Unfortunately, relying on your common sense lures you down a path of elusive expectations that may create disappointment rather than satisfaction. However, nearly anything is possible now once you accept that reality is not playing by the causal rules of the material world. If you can conjure up an image in your dreams, you stand an excellent chance of turning it into something tangible."
aries,2015-01-27,"An inflexible attitude can create problems today, especially if you get into a disagreement about something that's important to you. You're confident about your point of view, but you might feel as if someone is conspiring to change your mind. Avoid escalating a passionate discussion into unnecessary conflict. Although there's no reason to be shy about clearly informing everyone exactly where you stand, remaining open to other people's perspectives could lead to unexpected personal growth."
taurus,2015-01-27,"Although you reserve the right to change your opinion often today, don't expect your friends to keep up with your uncharacteristic mood swings. The Moon's current visit to your pragmatic sign reassures you that your emotions make sense and that no one else has the authority to tell you how to react. Someone else's actions won't likely shift your position, but it's wise to keep your options open now, just in case. Altering your course at the right time increases your chances for success."
gemini,2015-01-27,"You might not be interested in expressing your emotions today while the Moon squares talkative Mercury from your 12th House of Privacy. If you do choose to share your feelings, your words may be misconstrued as more aggressive than you intend. Wait until tomorrow when the reflective Moon enters your sign before telling everyone what you think. Avoiding a tricky conversation is much easier if you simply don't go there in the first place. Make use of this quiet time by exploring the magic in your dreams."
cancer,2015-01-27,"You are at your best today when you're involved in a community project or part of a team at work. However, you might not be able to assume the identity that's necessary for you to fully merge with the rest of the group. Your current resistance to assimilation encourages non-conforming behavior, but don't be afraid of stepping into the center of the circle -- even if you believe you would be more comfortable now standing out on the edge. You have too much to bring to the table to justify going off on your own."
leo,2015-01-27,"You may be asked to pitch in and help someone out now, even if you're weary of putting your needs second. But your generous spirit prevails because the Moon's presence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility indicates your need to assist others in reaching their potential. Thankfully, the Moon's smooth trine to unwavering Pluto empowers you to make a plan and then stick to it as if your life depends on it. Focusing on the details allows your energy to flow more easily throughout the day. When you give to others, you receive more in return."
virgo,2015-01-27,"Your efficiency is challenged by people around you today as they make their dreams sound fascinating enough to distract you from your path. However, the determined Taurus Moon goes a long way toward keeping you on your path. Nevertheless, you still need to pay attention to the boundaries of your coworkers (or the lack of them) if you want to feel good about your accomplishments by the end of the day. Rely on tried and true methodologies to get ahead, even if you are inspired by others to reach for the stars."
libra,2015-01-27,"You prefer to keep things light and easy now, but could get drawn into intense discussions about your feelings, anyhow. You might be annoyed with the emotional detour today while the sensible Taurus Moon visits your 8th House of Deep Sharing. But don't try to hide your feelings behind a smile that says everything is fine. Let others know that you are available to partake in an uncomfortable discussion but you're not willing to feed into any negativity. Your clarity in communication saves the day."
scorpio,2015-01-27,"You may have an encounter with a friend or a lover today that temporarily turns him or her into an opponent rather than an ally. However, it's not in your best interest to acquiesce too quickly because some things shouldn't be negotiable. Your current nemesis might appear to be quite determined, but will likely give in under your persistent pressure. Luckily, your relationships can be strengthened in the long run if you remain true to your heart."
sagittarius,2015-01-27,"A simplistic approach to your life is a healthy antidote to your hectic schedule today. Instead of seeking the peak experiences of inspiration, you're motivated to meet your responsibilities in a timely manner because you don't like the heaviness of unfulfilled promises weighing on your conscience. Although it goes against your nature, you could benefit greatly now by letting go of the big picture and concentrating on the details one item at a time."
capricorn,2015-01-27,"You have a magic touch now and can transform the most mundane chores into fantastic opportunities for personal fulfillment. But don't let financial considerations stand in your way; it should only take a few days to resolve the stressful money issues. Luckily, you can achieve personal satisfaction even while working today because the earthy Taurus Moon assists you in a practical manner while traveling through your 5th House of Love and Creativity. Sometimes the most wonderful experiences are the ones right in front of your nose."
aquarius,2015-01-27,"You can sense a shift in the cosmic energy as beautiful Venus leaves your sign for the greener pastures of your dreams. You might be a bit disoriented if your needs don't align with where you seem to be heading now. Unfortunately, the more you try to find your way back to the basics, the more complicated everything becomes. Don't rely on logic to determine your next move; trust your instincts to steer you in the right direction today. Your search for answers starts with loving yourself."
pisces,2015-01-27,"You could become singularly focused in your quest to accomplish your goals today because you might be trying to justify taking time off later. But this strategy is ineffectual if you have already overloaded your calendar with so much to do that it will be a miracle if you can meet your own expectations. Instead of dreaming about a possible escape in the future, embrace the beauty of present moment while sweet Venus is gracing your imaginative sign with her presence. Change your mind and find happiness in the here and now."
aries,2015-01-28,"Doing too much at once is part of your modus operandi, but everything may fly out of control today if you don't wisely practice time management. You're tempted to overload your schedule because you think you might go crazy if you don't keep yourself busy. However, your concern about missing the action is unwarranted; there will be plenty of opportunities even if you cut back on your commitments. Paradoxically, you might accomplish more if you narrow your focus and try to do less."
taurus,2015-01-28,"Acting spontaneously sounds liberating today, but previous obligations might prevent you from accepting an invitation to a special social event. You may be annoyed with a coworker who steps in to play the role of leader, even if he or she isn't your real boss. Ironically, once you accept that your work comes first now, you will be able to enjoy your free time with a clear conscience. Oddly enough, acknowledging limitations can bring more freedom than you expect."
gemini,2015-01-28,"You might feel as if you have been set up because you weren't told all the facts prior to agreeing to participate in a project at work. Thankfully, the Moon's current visit to your adaptable sign reminds you of how facile you are when it comes to learning as you go along. Nevertheless, you don't appreciate it when specific information is intentionally kept from you. It's your decision alone whether or not to proceed under the current circumstances; no one can fault you for being true to yourself."
cancer,2015-01-28,"You don't know how to react to something you hear today, especially if it doesn't match up to the picture you already had in your mind. You want to put all the pieces together, but the circumstances are complicated and elude logic. You're inclined to set aside reason and follow your instincts, but you will have more success now if you go over the facts again and again, until they fit into place. Practicing patience enables you to think clearly until you find the answers you seek."
leo,2015-01-28,"You are wary of anyone who backs away from facing the music today. You aren't interested in pussyfooting around; you need inarguable facts to get to the bottom of the truth. However, others might want to take a more casual wait-and-see approach which ruffles your feathers. Even if talking about your concerns smooths over differences, a final resolution may be hard to come by now. The good news is the outcome continues to grow more favorable over the next few weeks. Focusing on your common goals is the key to your success."
virgo,2015-01-28,"You often struggle while tackling several tasks simultaneously because you prefer setting priorities and concentrating on one job at a time. However, you're more adept at multitasking now, effortlessly moving between projects. Nevertheless, you still could reach a tipping point if you feel like you're juggling too many things at once. It's just not worth the stress; set some chores aside for a bit so you can tie up the loose ends on what's most important. Seize this opportunity to finish up old business once and for all."
libra,2015-01-28,"You might appear more stubborn than you actually are now, but anyone who makes assumptions about you too quickly could easily misread your energy. You're eager to discuss your plans and figure out the best way to bring your ideas to fruition. However, your determination can be mistaken for inflexibility today. Sticking to your agenda makes strategic sense as long as you also remain open to finding better solutions to achieve your objectives."
scorpio,2015-01-28,"Your willingness to make a commitment means a lot today because you're determined to put aside your pursuit of happiness while you fulfill your promises. Naturally, with Venus and Mars visiting your 5th House of Fun and Games, you would much rather be playing, but your priorities are quite clear now. You know that you won't be able to fully enjoy yourself if you're worrying about letting others down. Taking pride in your unwavering loyalty is enough of a reward by itself."
sagittarius,2015-01-28,"Hopefully, the relationship work you have recently done begins to pay off, even if your partner or companion hasn't yet noticed the difference in your behavior. It's easy to get discouraged today waiting for recognition, especially if others appear to have an easier time than you in the romance department. Don't let your impatience spoil the positive changes that are right around the next corner. Your good intentions and a solid commitment to authenticity are enough to keep you on the right path."
capricorn,2015-01-28,"Although you might be worried that you can't handle your current responsibilities now, your friends and associates are confident you can rise to the occasion. Even if you aren't interested in working so hard today, you still have the necessary stamina to finish the job. But if you find yourself distracted by an unexpected event, simply refocus on your goals as quickly as you can. Ultimately, your steady demeanor and fierce determination will lead you to the success you seek."
aquarius,2015-01-28,"Even if you are working to solidify plans with others, a gulf can widen between you and a friend. It's frustrating if progress is delayed by your attempts to figure out who's right and wrong today; a smarter strategy assumes that everyone has something positive to offer. Your chances of success improve when you take the best parts of each idea and combine them to create the ultimate plan. Cooperation isn't easy today, but a healthy process of give and take produces the results you want."
pisces,2015-01-28,"There are more than enough facts at your disposal today, and additional information doesn't make your decision any easier. Nor does knowing more ensure a better outcome, even with the Moon finishing up her stay in your 3rd House of Information. You probably already have all the answers you need. Don't bother sorting through the details one more time; instead, clear your mind of excess distractions. The right choice will come from your internal wisdom and not from external sources."
aries,2015-01-29,"Although you're quite aware of your feelings today, you don't necessarily want to make them available for public consumption. Others probably realize that you're keeping your concerns to yourself, but they might not be able to figure out how to react to your silence. Thankfully, you don't have to worry about what others think now; you only have to decide for yourself how much you want to share. Keep in mind that revealing your secrets not only increases your vulnerability, but also sets the tone to strengthen a significant relationship."
taurus,2015-01-29,"You may be swept up in a complex dilemma that pushes you up against the edges of your own comfort zone. But it's really not as dramatic as you make it out to be, even if you're anxious hanging out in the emotional realms. Don't waste energy trying to control your feelings since that strategy never works as well as you wish. Instead, carefully observe what makes you uncomfortable today as your key planet Venus tenses up under stern Saturn's pressure. If you're willing to go there, self-awareness is the most effective catalyst for change all by itself."
gemini,2015-01-29,"You might be required to make a choice today, and responsibility typically wins out over fun while sensible Saturn forms a stressful square with pleasurable Venus. It appears as if fateful circumstances are controlling your life now rather than your own desires -- and it grates on your nerves because you prefer to be in charge of your own destiny. Pushing through your own resistance is your key to gaining knowledge about higher truths. Delaying gratification seems like a sacrifice, but it could lead to a deeper sense of contentment in the long run."
cancer,2015-01-29,"Although you have to manage your normal routine today, it's important to also take time to reflect on your emotional needs. Even if your current self-absorption seems a bit out of character, you stand to make real gains if you can isolate what you want for your own happiness. You might try to apply logic to an illogical situation, but it won't help you untangle your feelings now. Take a risk and leave the rational world behind while you explore the realms of your imagination and heart."
leo,2015-01-29,"You are quite capable of creating a bubble of happiness around you if you can graciously accept the present limitations now. Unfortunately, it seems as if there isn't room enough in the bubble for anyone else, so you may experience a temporary sense of isolation. Nevertheless, the constraints are imaginary; there are no barriers between you and those you love, except the ones you build yourself."
virgo,2015-01-29,"You think you can sidestep relationship obligations because you have more important things to do today. However, you won't be able to escape from doing your part without adversely affecting the dynamics between you and loved ones. You might not be pleased with those who make demands on you, but you don't need to isolate yourself to prove your point. Instead of erecting unnecessary boundaries around your heart, try meeting others halfway. Finding a healthy balance between dependence and freedom is your best route to a happier personal life."
libra,2015-01-29,"Someone at work may get on your case today about an issue you consider trivial. You might not intend any harm, but what you say now can inadvertently hurt a person you care about. Try to maintain a high level of compassion in all your interactions. If you open your heart, a friendship will have a chance to blossom, even if it doesn't happen overnight. Plant the seeds of good will and watch them grow."
scorpio,2015-01-29,"You may have to confront issues of low self-esteem today, making you doubt your every move. However, relationship problems seem to grow if you withdraw to address your concerns on your own. Your detachment could make the other person uncomfortable with the emotional distance. Don't take yourself or anyone else too seriously now since the energy will warm up again in a few days. In the meantime, keep the communication channels as clear as possible to foster a harmonious atmosphere."
sagittarius,2015-01-29,"You might not even try to bridge the widening gap between your emotions and the circumstances of your life now that austere Saturn is at odds with sweetheart Venus. Be courageous and face the current issues, even if it doesn't seem like it's worth your effort. You may not feel fully satisfied with your accomplishments today, but the rewards will follow if you simply show up and do the work."
capricorn,2015-01-29,"Your need for close companionship cools today, possibly leading you to spend time on your own in self-reflection. However, your friends and coworkers might misinterpret your behavior and think you're being negative in spite of how you explain your true intentions. Let your actions speak for you by doing something constructive, no matter how inconsequential it seems. Methodical and careful movement enables you to progress toward your goals while still keeping your emotions to yourself. Nevertheless, don't stay in your reverie too long or you might miss the support that's within reach."
aquarius,2015-01-29,"You have social commitments that you prefer to avoid as friendly Venus struggles with cranky Saturn in your 11th House of Community. Unfortunately, you still must deliver on previous promises, even if you want to just lay low and fly under the radar. It may be easier to rationalize attending a function if you consider it to be business-related. Push through your own resistance and join the human race; you might end up having more fun than you anticipated. Fake it until you make it."
pisces,2015-01-29,"An emotional dynamic could work in one of two ways today. On one hand, you might pull back from the intensity of interactions with others to establish clear boundaries for yourself. On the other hand, you can apply your talents in more practical ways now. But even if you don't feel as creative as usual, your artistic or technical skills could still be put to good use. Overcome any lingering discouragement or self-doubt and swim steadily toward your goals."
aries,2015-01-30,"You're concerned that time is running out and you still have a lot of unfinished business on your plate. Even if you have a plan to complete your work prior to the weekend, it's still a good idea to limit your nonessential activities so you can fulfill your obligations. It's not easy to make the best choices now unless you stand back from the social whirlwind, set new priorities and follow through in a practical manner. Thankfully, you have plenty of motivation and stamina to spare, so get busy while action packed Mars is working on your behalf."
taurus,2015-01-30,"You have plenty of ideas about your future, but can't decide on a single course of action when there are so many choices. It's challenging now because you prefer to limit your options and concentrate on one thing at a time. Exercise caution, even if you're still tempted to squeeze in another activity. Overbooking your day is currently not in your best interest. Honor your preferred work style by extracting the most out of every single experience before moving on to the next."
gemini,2015-01-30,"You may be so restless today that you're ready to leave the safety of your world in order to step into an adventure. Unfortunately, prior responsibilities make it nearly impossible to simply fly off into the sunset on your dream vacation. Nevertheless, the combination of the Moon's presence in your sign and retrograde Mercury's alignment with the Sun inspires you to plan even even more escapades. However, concentrating your attention on the immediate work at hand frees up more time to enjoy your explorations later on."
cancer,2015-01-30,"You're bouncing off the walls today and might have trouble calming your feelings. Fortunately, others can't see past your smokescreen of complacency; it's much easier to manage your desires by temporarily keeping them to yourself. Everything becomes more complicated once you share what is on your mind -- so be careful of what subjects you bring up on your own. Discretion is your secret weapon as long as you use it wisely. Knowing who to trust is the key to your success."
leo,2015-01-30,"Your high standards at work make for unrealistic expectations that are difficult to meet now. Although you can understand why your associates are acting as they do, logic doesn't diminish your disappointment. It's a mistake to give up on a teammate when they have so much to offer. Your best bet is to cut him or her some slack for being who they are rather than who you want them to be. Standing by a potential ally strengthens your relationship for the long haul. Demonstrating your loyalty is a good place to start."
virgo,2015-01-30,"You have ambitious objectives and probably have already lined up a variety of interesting activities for the day. But the separate events might not unfold as expected. Don't stress yourself out trying to force your agenda on to the changing landscape. Luckily, you can hold on to your overall vision, even if you need to make adjustments to your original plans along the way. It might feel as if you're fighting for your survival, but you need to pace yourself if you want to come out a winner. You can forfeit a few battles and still remain victorious in the war."
libra,2015-01-30,"It feels as if you're on a roller-coaster ride today as your emotions rise and fall and rise again, leaving you with a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. You might grow weary of the excitement, yet you don't know how to stop it. Don't worry; things are already in the process of slowing down, even if they remain intense throughout the day. The trick is to be present with your reactions in every moment without being obsessed about what happens next. Living in the here-and-now is not as easy as it sounds; nevertheless, peace of mind is a reward worth the effort."
scorpio,2015-01-30,Your emotions seem raw today but you're still capable of moving through powerful transformations very quickly. The efficiency at which you can process negativity now is a direct result of what you have already learned from doing your own shadow work. It's not time to battle with ghosts from the past; it's your turn to dance with them. Jump into the fire of experience and then let go when the metamorphosis is complete.
sagittarius,2015-01-30,"Although you might think you can cleverly step around an emotional swamp today, you may still become enmeshed in someone else's drama. Luckily, you won't stay too serious for long, since your wicked sense of humor is your saving grace now. Just don't laugh things off too quickly; being funny just to avoid an important issue won't solve a thing. Nevertheless, a proper dose of lighthearted charm at the right moment is the perfect antidote to a sticky situation."
capricorn,2015-01-30,"You're tempted to employ a heavy-handed approach at work today, but your attempts will likely fall short of pulling it off successfully. Luckily, you're not inclined to take yourself too seriously now because you can see exciting possibilities every which way you turn. Even if you can't decipher your future clearly yet, there's no reason to push it away. Use your energy wisely to work with the natural currents instead of trying to control them. It's not your job to eliminate the clouds; the sky will clear on its own."
aquarius,2015-01-30,"Your strategies are changing so fast now that it's hard to make long-term decisions. Cerebral Mercury is backpedaling past the Sun in your logical sign to rev up your mental activity. However, you may be afraid of losing your intellectual edge before you have a solid plan for the future. The current situation might not be as critical as it seems; your fears are probably worse than any possible outcome. Nevertheless, focus on the best-case scenario since your simple act of intention actually helps to manifest your vision."
pisces,2015-01-30,"You can't wallow in discouragement today, even if you encounter resistance from someone at work. Although an old issue may rear its ugly head again, you can deal with it from a position of strength, not weakness. The present circumstances are substantially different from the previous ones; you are a creator of your karma and not a victim of it. Focus on the sweet potential rather than doom and gloom. Maintaining a positive attitude may be more crucial to your future than anything else you can do now."
aries,2015-01-31,"Harboring secret getaway plans could be a sweet distraction today, but they may fall apart once you remember all the promises you made. Even if you're willing to leave your responsibilities behind, there are too many other reasons quickly piling up against your great escape. But don't throw in the towel just yet. Everything is still in flux and you might find a way to realize your fantasy. No matter what happens, it's healthy to renegotiate the balance between work and play while you have the chance."
taurus,2015-01-31,"You're excited about your career now, yet it's also a source of endless worry. Finding a place of rest isn't easy as you are distracted by one thing after another today. Even if there are things going on beyond your control, you can bring about positive change if you're willing to be patient. Just because you can't do everything right away doesn't mean that your efforts aren't effective. Imagining your success is the first step to getting there."
gemini,2015-01-31,"Although you have good reason to be prudent with your finances now, you are still tempted to buy something beyond your means. Weigh out the pros and cons carefully before committing the money, for a large purchase might over-extend your cash position. Even if can justify your expenditure, it's still better to rein in your impulses than to learn an unpleasant lesson the hard way. Reevaluating your resources is a much wiser use of this time."
cancer,2015-01-31,"Oftentimes, you comfortably dance around the edge of your feelings, especially if you are uncomfortable with them. However, it's important that you get to the source of your desires now or you'll inadvertently create situations that will undermine your happiness. Reconsidering your relationship priorities is an excellent way to start this journey that leads you to reconnect with your heart."
leo,2015-01-31,"If others are resisting your current pursuit of your dream, reconsider your role in bringing these unsupportive people into your life. The relationship houses of your chart are heating up, but you might need to look at your own past in order to better understand your current predicament. Draw on the courage of the Lion; it may hurt to learn what you need to know, but you'll feel more empowered once you know the truth."
virgo,2015-01-31,"Petty disputes with your friends or family may stir up old wounds today. Even if you believe it is wiser to leave old issues buried, they still might trigger conflict anyway. No matter how unpleasant it sounds, one more exploration into your personal history can help you gain clarity on your present life. Revisiting your past now could be an effective catalyst that ultimately sets your life back on track."
libra,2015-01-31,"Your current circumstances at work may feel oddly familiar as you have trouble judging the relative importance of a particular situation. You often tend to look at the bright side of things, but can get hung up now with all that is wrong. Vacillating between optimism and pessimism makes it impossible to reach a final decision. Waiting a day or two to see where the energy takes you might be useful. Thankfully, your negativity could very well dissipate on its own if you just remember to recount your blessings whenever doubt begins to surface."
scorpio,2015-01-31,"Although you might have a case of the blues today, you can change the game by not taking yourself too seriously. You may be reconsidering the relationship between how much you need to work and what benefits you receive in return. Unfortunately, it might seem as if you're being short-changed, but retreating to your corner to sulk won't solve anything in the long run. Stick with your routine for now, since your temporary discouragement will pass. Fortunately, your rewards are waiting just around the corner."
sagittarius,2015-01-31,"Deeply-rooted patterns are sneaking into your awareness today, awakening you from a fantasy that still continues to fascinate you. However, you can now see your attachment to the past. Even if there is some emotional pain connected with your memories, the air is being cleared so you may move on. There is no need to hang onto behaviors that aren't productive any longer just because they worked for you once before. Retelling your story in a different light transforms you from a victim into a hero."
capricorn,2015-01-31,"Friends and relatives might make you uneasy today because they bring you face to face with your core values. Unfortunately, some principles that you hold dear are based upon opinion rather than fact. Thankfully, what you now learn can help you separate your beliefs from the truth. Don't be afraid to look at your life from an entirely different perspective. Reassessing your emotional needs creates an opportunity to build relationships on solid foundations rather than worn-out assumptions."
aquarius,2015-01-31,"Although you are quite enthusiastic about your future prospects, prior commitments prevent you from heading off in a new direction now. Family obligations could be defining your schedule, but a busy calendar ultimately won't get in your way. You are unstoppable, even if everything takes longer than you wish. But don't let doubt creep into your thoughts. Instead, do what is expected of you today while you continue to dream about tomorrow."
pisces,2015-01-31,"You have the capability to make headway now on a variety of innovative projects, but your activities are not just about carefree, playful expression. What you create must also be practical. However, it's wise to be cautious about falling into the Venus trap of believing that beauty is more important than anything else. The good news is you won't have to deal with disappointment if you can remember to keep your feet on the ground when reaching for the stars."
aries,2015-02-01,"You're more likely to be spellbound by the vision of an ideal romance today than tumble head-over-heels for any individual. Because this kind of conceptual love is hard to manifest, you may have a real problem on your hands, especially if you are dealing with someone else's jealousy. Striving to be honest is admirable, but this doesn't mean you should reveal all your fantasies. Nevertheless, be as clear as possible when sharing your feelings or you could face resistance to your free thinking."
taurus,2015-02-01,"You are less interested in getting dragged into an emotional discussion now than you are in losing yourself in a most sublime fantasy. Although beautiful Venus hooks up with illusory Neptune to fascinate you with dreams of perfect love, your joy could be founded on ideas of escape. Your inner world may be so alluring that you just can't resist the urge to daydream. Luckily, you can enjoy the diversion as long as you remember the difference between what's real and what's not."
gemini,2015-02-01,"Your charm can work wonders but cautionary alarms need to remind you that you are so convincing today that you could actually con yourself, too. Thankfully, you may be able to avoid self-deception by considering what others need from you instead of only looking out for your best interests. Your perspective widens when you engage in honest dialogue. Reexamining your priorities now prevents colossal headaches down the road."
cancer,2015-02-01,"Shift your thinking into the higher realms of spirituality, rather than only focusing  on your quest for romantic love. Find something that touches your soul and connects you to the beauty of the cosmos. Organized ritual works for some, yet reflective meditation may be better for others. Even a few minutes of solitude can provide a chance for you to hear your own inner voice that guides you on your magical journey."
leo,2015-02-01,"It's a lovely surprise when a significant other opens up to you, so listen carefully with your undivided attention to every word said. It isn't useful today to criticize or even disagree with anything in particular. Simply receive a heartfelt disclosure as the precious gift it is. The potential for intimacy is great when you are invited into someone else's imagination, so don't ruin it by trying to be practical. Instead, give yourself permission to join in and dream a little dream, too."
virgo,2015-02-01,You might attempt to cling to the irrefutable facts as if they are a lifeline today because fantasies can totally disrupt your efficiency. The songs of the mythical sirens are luring you away from logic and the lush landscape of imagination can be very enticing. Don't fight the call just because you are afraid it's not real; let your guard down and allow the magical healing power of love fill your soul with joy.
libra,2015-02-01,"Although you are naturally attuned to beauty, now your tastes are more refined and your opinions are more defined. Your key planet Venus conspires with fanciful Neptune to raise the bar of excellence when it comes to experiencing pleasure. You can visualize your ideal, yet you are also captivated by the intensity of the present moment. Let your love light shine by encouraging your creativity to take flight and your imagination to wander."
scorpio,2015-02-01,"You may tumble down the rabbit hole today, a victim of sweet infatuation, but you might not tell anyone about it. Although you could be quite entranced with your magical journey, it feels safer to stay quiet about your emotions now, especially if you're not prepared to deal with the consequences. The choice is yours; your heartfelt desires belong to you alone, so don't be afraid to wear a mysterious smile and keep everyone guessing for a while longer."
sagittarius,2015-02-01,"Your willingness to believe your own hype sets you up to promise more than you can deliver today. You might think others are expecting a superhuman performance from you, no matter how much you do to prove your competence. Instead of tiring yourself out trying to accomplish too much, pare back your activities before it's too late. Even if the variety of possible activities makes it difficult to prioritize them, choose anyhow and move on. Whatever you decide will create a life of its own."
capricorn,2015-02-01,"Trusting your senses is tricky business today, especially if you think you should be doing something else than what's on your calendar. It seems unfair that you can't just enjoy the beauty of the moment, but it may not feel right to abandon your chores. Working hard early in the day is one way to alleviate the stress and can help you to justify blocking off time to escape into a fantasy later on. Your future grows from the seeds of potential that you sow into your fertile dreams."
aquarius,2015-02-01,"Your charisma is more alluring than you realize today, as the magical Venus-Neptune alignment heaps an extra helping of radiance onto your plate. Sharing your dreams enables you to transmit vibes that capture others in your web of illusion. Your mind is powerful now and may even affect physical reality. Wizard-like, you can think yourself stronger, taller or prettier -- and magically, that is how you are perceived. Use this special gift wisely for the good of all."
pisces,2015-02-01,"Some things are better left unsaid, so just soak in the pleasure of sweet stillness today and enjoy the unspoken stories of love. Your key planet Neptune sends you to the outer limits of your imagination as it receives a delicious kiss from enchanting Venus. Even if you try to explain what's happening, your words cannot adequately convey your magical flights of fancy. Silence is golden during moments of indescribable beauty."
aries,2015-02-02,"Your drive to explore new territory is countered by uncharacteristic feelings of self-doubt today. An inner voice reminds you to be sensitive to other people's needs over your own. However, the advice won't likely prevent you from acting on a brilliant idea if you have the chance. Just remember to temper your desire for immediate action with kindness so you don't inadvertently hurt someone you love. Taking the high road sets the standard for everyone to follow."
taurus,2015-02-02,"You just might save the day by inventing the amazing plan that everyone has been dreaming about. Ironically, your stroke of brilliance could come at the very last minute. Your logic is sound today, even if it' s unconventional and unexpected. Sharing your idea encourages others to lend their support to your solution. But don't be afraid to take charge now; assume a leadership role until you are sure that everything is running smoothly and can be left in the hands of someone who can take it to the next level."
gemini,2015-02-02,"You are flying at top speed today, yet you still feel something weighing you down. The feeling of carrying too much baggage may be associated with an unpleasant memory that raises issues of self-doubt. However, you can't get very far as long as you're in denial. Thankfully, you can change everything by simply being more aware of your emotions and taking responsibility for your current actions. The dead weight could be dropped in an instant once you accept your past and move on."
cancer,2015-02-02,"You want to express your emotional needs as forthright as possible today, and you expect people to sit up and take notice of your clarity. There might even be one particular person you hope to impress, prompting you to act impulsively in a manner that is completely out of character. Your spontaneous behavior could attract the attention you seek, but maybe not in the way you prefer. Don't try so hard; just be yourself and don't worry so much about the outcome. Speak your truth and let the chips fall where they may."
leo,2015-02-02,"Helping others is a primary concern today, but you prefer to do it sight unseen while the Moon is still visiting your 12th House of Invisibility. Thankfully, you can accomplish something that means a great deal to someone close to you after the Moon's midday shift into your sign. You might not even realize what you did, but your generous actions could bring deep healing to a loved one. Fortunately, grandiose gestures aren't necessary; it's your intention that matters most."
virgo,2015-02-02,"There is no reason to take the fall for someone else's erratic behavior. If a coworker does something that catches you off guard today, just do your best to take it all in stride. Luckily, unexpected twists and turns could open your eyes to a different way to do a routine task. It might seem like a reach at first, but you may discover that you're the only one who has been standing in the way of your success. Changing your perspective gives you new options."
libra,2015-02-02,"You might step away from the spotlight today because you know you're not in control of others while the Sun aligns with unpredictable Uranus in your 7th House of Relationships. You don't mind a bit of anonymity, but it might be time to reexamine your insecurities if you're uncomfortable with a lack of attention. Luckily, you could be more effective now using your talents to help someone else achieve their goals. There's no need to worry if you don't receive the credit you deserve today; the spotlight will return to you soon enough."
scorpio,2015-02-02,"You might feel as if there's no way out of your previous commitments. You're willing to resign yourself to do what you said, even if you're unhappy with how things have developed. Thankfully, everything can suddenly flip as an ingenious idea lights up your brain like a flash of lightning. Prepare for positive change with cheerful optimism since your attitude can make as big a difference as anything else."
sagittarius,2015-02-02,"Fitting into the standard constraints of a traditional relationship is nearly impossible now that your emotions explode with brilliance in their own unique way. You have something very special to offer, so don't be too self-judgmental if your heart refuses to take orders from your head. Fortunately, those closest to you probably already know that your intentions are well meaning. If they can appreciate you for who you are, rather than who they want you to be, it should all work out. But first, you must learn to love yourself."
capricorn,2015-02-02,"You are in direct touch with your feelings now as you attract highly emotional people into your orbit. You often avoid revealing too much vulnerability, but you might be destabilized enough today to open up to someone you trust. Exploring a tough issue gives you a chance to learn more about yourself. Luckily, a difficult situation can rapidly morph into a more pleasant one if you're willing to roll with the incoming waves. Let go of your expectations and embrace the unknown."
aquarius,2015-02-02,"You might believe you're headed for a major conflict today, when out of the blue everything dramatically improves. Don't try to rein in anyone's behavior because your fear of a negative outcome could actually coax it into manifestation. Thankfully, you have the power to sidestep an unnecessary dispute today if you remember that open conflict won't bring you any closer to your goals. Solve your current problems within your brilliant imagination before trying to affect positive change on the outside. The solution is within the grasp of your mind."
pisces,2015-02-02,"It could be safer than you think to jump into the  abyss of the unknown today, as long as you trust that everything will work out for the best. Fortunately, you are able to gather the support you need now as long as you establish clear priorities. Nevertheless, your creative visualizations only take you so far. The power of positive thought still needs to be reinforced with a concrete plan and solid effort. You can turn a long shot into a sure bet if you're willing to work for what you want."
aries,2015-02-03,"It may seem as if you've been coloring within the lines for too long, but now you remember what it's like to be your creative self. Today's showy Leo Full Moon highlights your 5th House of Fun and Games, urging you to express yourself spontaneously, whether or not you are artistically inclined. But even if you struggle finding a source of inspiration, a touch of uncertainty works in your favor today if it prevents you from doing something foolish. Paradoxically, you can dazzle others with your brilliance without going over the edge."
taurus,2015-02-03,"Your professional stability may be under stress now, especially if you also have to manage inescapable domestic responsibilities. The Leo Full Moon falls in your 4th House of Foundations, shifting your focus to personal matters, even without family obligations weighing on you today. When your inner core is tested, you're motivated to dig in your heels and stand firm. Your tenacity serves you well as long as you don't overplay your hand."
gemini,2015-02-03,"You might try to remain incognito today, but casting the spotlight on your contributions isn't such a bad idea. You could even turn out to be a hero if you're willing to take a risk and make a splash. But presenting too many alternatives at once may prove distracting to all involved. The demonstrative Leo Full Moon shines in your 3rd House of Communication, inspiring you to see a viable solution others miss. Simplify your ideas and they will carry you and those around you toward greater success."
cancer,2015-02-03,"Trouble could be brewing if you recently made extravagant purchases that were not within your budget. Your self-esteem is at stake, so you might go ahead and spend more, even if you don't really have the resources. Meanwhile, today's Leo Full Moon lands in your 2nd House of Money, placing extra emphasis on your finances. Being mindful of your current frivolous tendencies may be enough to help you keep your dollars in the bank. The most important blessings are not material ones."
leo,2015-02-03,"Hiding your needs is a futile endeavor today, for they -- along with your idealistic dreams -- are creating observable ripples on the surface. This Full Moon in your sign increases the magnitude of your emotions and complicates your day more than you can imagine. But any attempts to bury your feelings now will just attract bigger problems. Your mantra is ""express, don't suppress."" Just keep kindness in mind when making a few waves of your own."
virgo,2015-02-03,"You could sour a sweet moment by giving it too analytical of a spin today. Just because you are anxious over the lack of clarity, there's no need to ruin a thrilling experience with so many details that you lose the magic. Luckily, the choice is yours because the Leo Full Moon lights up your 12th House of Imagination, reminding you that loose ends have their purpose. Don't try to push a situation to its logical conclusion; let the natural flow of events dictate your next move. There's no time like the present to pursue your dreams."
libra,2015-02-03,"Avoid overstated dramatic gestures today, for it's more important to be in touch with your own feelings than to put on a show for someone else. Anything can happen now, but stress could quickly grow out of hand if you're too rigid about sticking to your plan. Although the Leo Full Moon stirs up drama in your 11th House of Social Activities, relationships can be a significant source of excitement if you're willing to let go of old expectations. Responding fluidly to the changing circumstances creates the most reliable path to satisfaction."
scorpio,2015-02-03,"The difference between what you want and what you must do is greater than normal and you may believe that you've lost your way. The Leo Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Public Responsibility, heightening your sensitivity to the needs of your coworkers. But you're not willing to set your personal goals aside just to satisfy someone else's wishes. Achieving inner peace is nearly impossible if you assume an all-or-nothing attitude to save your pride. You have a shot at obtaining happiness if you know how to practice the art of compromise."
sagittarius,2015-02-03,"Those closest to you are amused and amazed at what comes forth from your mind today. You could be on a roll and believe there's no limit to what you can do while the lively Leo Full Moon brightens your 9th House of Adventure, infusing your imagination with inspirational ideas. However, it's prudent to remember you are as human as everyone else is. Soar to new heights but don't take anything past the point of acceptability. Consider your audience before you open your mouth."
capricorn,2015-02-03,"You may be less certain than usual about your destination, yet, oddly enough, you could be more confident about getting there. Additionally, you are easily confused by other people's outrageous ideas now that the Leo Full Moon joins flamboyant Jupiter in your 8th House of Shared Resources. Although you're excited about new avenues of expression, you are also wary of making a sudden wrong move. If you can't yet determine your next step, it's not time to take it. There is no penalty for waiting until your path clears and your goal is in sight."
aquarius,2015-02-03,"Although you might want to sidestep messy emotional involvements, withdrawing in fear only creates more tension. Stay fully present while others express their feelings, even if you aren't sure where the conversation is leading. However, the melodramatic Leo Full Moon rattles your 7th House of Partners, increasing the odds of someone needing more than you can give now. Establishing clear boundaries enables you to maintain your autonomy while still connecting with someone you love."
pisces,2015-02-03,"Make use of the vibrant Leo Full Moon's presence in your 6th House of Daily Routine to improve your overall well-being, especially if you recently experienced a health concern. Even if you are at the top of your game, you might be susceptible to stress now, so it's still wise to be proactive and watch your diet and get proper exercise. Instead of being overwhelmed by all the big changes on the horizon today, consolidate your vision by first making a list of your tasks and tackling something that is easily manageable. Small steps will lead you to success."
aries,2015-02-04,"Someone close to you may push your emotional buttons today. Although you try to look the other way, you probably won't be able to hide your annoyance while assertive Mars aligns with self-righteous Jupiter. Presenting a smiling face won't be enough to avoid an interaction that could erupt into an unpleasant encounter. Thankfully, you can turn this difficult situation around by transforming your anger into compassion. Showing a little love and a lot of understanding goes a long way now toward making everyone happy."
taurus,2015-02-04,"You might feel as if it's time to set the record straight. You are prepared for a confrontation, if necessary, but everyone seems to mellow as the day draws on. Setting aside logic enables you to ride the emotional waves that originate within your subconscious without trying to suppress them. Although the relentless Leo Moon proves to be inflexible and tricky to handle, sharing an intimate experience can soften the energy and help to overcome your fears."
gemini,2015-02-04,"It's one thing to be absolutely sure of what you want, but fixating on any one particular goal is likely to bring you unhappiness today. You have a special opportunity now to push past an associate's judgment that's bothered you in the past more than it should. More importantly, you can use the power of positive thinking to turn a potentially obsessive approach into one that's certainly more manageable in the days to come. Pursue your dreams with a light touch and a joyful heart."
cancer,2015-02-04,"Your current resistance to change may be an obstacle to intimacy today. It's risky to reveal your feelings, so you might just let the present moment pass without saying anything at all. However, you have a chance to release an old pattern now. Start tentatively and focus on what is in your heart. Ultimately, your willingness to share your vulnerability can deepen your connection with someone you love."
leo,2015-02-04,"You can feel the magic of romance everywhere you go today. However, a dynamic change in a relationship won't likely happen until you're willing to listen to your partner and receive the same support you give so easily. Keep in mind that everything isn't always fun and games and that opening your heart to love also means opening it to heartache. Fortunately, a highly charged emotional interaction could morph into a more comfortable one later on if you're willing to let the process take its course."
virgo,2015-02-04,"You desire a quick resolution to a lingering disagreement and may try to force an issue in order to catalyze an already unstable situation. Don't push your luck by demanding that everyone stop in their tracks and listen to your every word. Paradoxically, your intentional avoidance of a tough issue can be just as dangerous as placing it the spotlight. Allowing your feelings to surface naturally without judging them as right or wrong keeps you on the path to emotional equilibrium."
libra,2015-02-04,"You may feel weary from following the dramas of your friends and associates, yet their stories have somehow become yours. It's no simple task to separate yourself from all the interpersonal relationships that require your time and attention. Although your stress might not disappear overnight, there's movement that brings you some comfort today. Don't try to figure out everything on your own. Leaning on a trusted companion can help just enough to move things in the right direction."
scorpio,2015-02-04,"You can't escape from your powerful feelings, even if it's not easy to integrate them into your day. Although it's usually wise to share what you want with someone you love, it's unfair to make him or her responsible for your satisfaction. Staying somewhat detached from the outcome creates sacred space for an original solution to magically unfold. Practicing just a touch of emotional self-restraint at the right moment can make all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2015-02-04,"You may jump to conclusions today, assuming you can get your needs met without even considering how others might respond to your actions. An irritating aspect between warrior Mars and bombastic Jupiter warps your perspective and could trigger behavior that's out of proportion with the current situation. There's no need to turn a minor setback into a national emergency. Quietly working behind the scenes accomplishes more than making a scene. Just remember, there is no free lunch; prepare to work harder than ever if you want to find lasting satisfaction."
capricorn,2015-02-04,"You might try to resist the pressure to reexamine your feelings today, for self-exploration currently seems like a lot of work without much benefit in return. Unfortunately, your desire to cling to the status quo could cost you dearly if you let an opportunity pass you by. Keep in mind that the real reward won't likely be found in riches or recognition, especially now karmic Saturn is activating the Sun in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. The good news is that you have a chance to experience a spiritual growth spurt, which can bring a kind of happiness that money can't buy."
aquarius,2015-02-04,"A casual discussion with a friend or partner today might raise unexpected emotional issues. Although this conversation may be constructive, it's easy to slip into disagreement over your conflicting needs. Applying a healthy dose of compassion helps you understand that you can have differing perspectives while still supporting one another's dreams. This mutual appreciation is a prerequisite to discovering a treasure that ultimately strengthens your relationship in a surprising manner."
pisces,2015-02-04,"Although it's not easy to comprehend all the forces that brought you to this very moment in your life, you're particularly clear about what you want to happen next. Unfortunately, current circumstances may not be very forgiving, offering you less leeway to respond to a complicated emotional dynamic. Luckily, you can make your decision-making process easier if you're willing to wait for satisfaction. Your patience is the key to ultimately achieving your goals."
aries,2015-02-05,"You prefer to see yourself as unrestrained as an eagle riding the thermals, but your responsibilities might not give you enough freedom today for actual flights of fancy. Even if you believe you know an escape route, it's still quite complicated to break out and make your move. Don't be hard on yourself if you're unable to follow through on your plan. Just relax and sink back into your daydreams until you're ready to make them come true."
taurus,2015-02-05,"Oddly enough, you may be content to engage in a flirtation today without actually making any progress toward cultivating true love. Nevertheless, your weariness builds to a crescendo if others make unreasonable demands of your time, tempting you to make a hasty retreat from the relationship scene. However, facing your fears is one way to push beyond the comforts of the status quo. Communication is challenging now, yet the potential for transformation brings you closer to happiness one conversation at a time."
gemini,2015-02-05,"Your emotions can drag you all over the map today, making it nearly impossible to rely on logic to decide what to do. It isn't that you are being wishy-washy; it's just difficult to make up your mind when staying open to all the possibilities sounds more fun. One minute you are eager to cash in your chips and move on. But the next minute you are trying to figure out how to hold onto what you have already gained. An all-or-nothing answer isn't in your best interest now when there is so much middle ground available to explore and so much at stake."
cancer,2015-02-05,"You have an important lesson to learn at work today, especially if an associate is standing in the way of your progress. Uncharacteristically, your first impulse may be to escalate a minor confrontation into a major fight. But there's no need to prove your superiority now just to make a point. Instead, adopt a spiritual approach that is non-confrontational and less emotionally charged. Taking the high road sets a fine example for others to follow."
leo,2015-02-05,"Everything could seem more complicated than necessary now, but you're not sure how to simplify your life to reduce your current stress. The complexity arises from your heart desiring something you don't know how to obtain. Holding firm to your personal goals now is a smart strategy that should ultimately pay off as long as you're willing to show some flexibility along the way. Discerning what is important and what is not is your ticket to success."
virgo,2015-02-05,"You have your heart set on getting ahead at work, but don't necessarily have enough patience to follow through with your plans today. The Moon's return to your sign increases your emotional sensitivity, leaving you frustrated because it would be easier to focus on your job without so many distractions from your personal life. Unfortunately, your friends and family might not be so supportive when it comes to your ambitions. Don't be afraid to set clear boundaries in order to honor your priorities. Paradoxically, knowing your limits is the first step to success."
libra,2015-02-05,"You may feel trapped by the obligations of your daily life, temporarily blocking your creative flow. But your regular routine could fall apart now, making it all but impossible to think about realizing your dreams. Don't sell yourself short by believing that you can't do the miraculous. You are much more capable of conjuring magic than you know, but you must have faith and practice patience for positive results to manifest."
scorpio,2015-02-05,"You need to decide whether or not you can keep up social appearances today while still remaining true to yourself. However, making the right choices now isn't as trivial as you think because they are part of an ongoing process that can redefine the structure of your relationships. Mental Mercury is arguing with physical Mars, intensifying your feelings as the boundary between platonic and romantic love is tested. There are no wrong paths to take now; no one can blame you for following your heart as long as you allow others to do the same."
sagittarius,2015-02-05,"Someone might give you a hard time about taking yourself so seriously today. Nevertheless, you have a lot going on now and you are not pleased if others disagree with you for no apparent reason. Keep in mind that it could be your own frustration that creates the bulk of your current stress. At least, make certain you continue to meet your obligations at work, even if you're still sorting out how to handle everything else. In the meantime, don't be afraid to laugh at your shortcomings. Let your sense of humor be your secret weapon as you go about your day."
capricorn,2015-02-05,"You might not be a very happy camper if a friend or family member wants something from you that you can't deliver now. Unfortunately, these demands could precipitate a power struggle that won't likely have a clear cut winner because of complicated interpersonal dynamics. Instead of getting ahead at someone else's expense, just focus your energy on being as awesome as possible. Don't waste your energy trying to fix an insoluble dilemma; alter the rules of the game, instead."
aquarius,2015-02-05,"Although you may be motivated to shake up the status quo today, a stabilizing Mercury-Saturn connection means you won't be successful until you acknowledge your current limitations. Fortunately, circumstances won't remain static, even if you don't see a clear path to your destination. Trying too hard now only pushes your goal further away. Paradoxically, loosening your grip on the future is the best way to make sure that you arrive there on time."
pisces,2015-02-05,"You're tired of having to learn hard lessons and may act in a rebellious manner just to see what you can get away with today. You're tempted to stir up a bit of mischief by challenging an authority figure who appears to be overly rigid in his or her approach. Examine your part in fomenting the current tension. Once you stop projecting your internal battles onto anyone else, relationship dynamics become much easier to navigate. Finding peace with others starts by creating peace within."
aries,2015-02-06,"It's nearly impossible to know when to stop, for you are overly enthusiastic about what lies ahead. You are an inspiration to others today, motivating them to join you in the passionate pursuit of your dreams. Nevertheless, it's important to be cognizant of the needs of those around you, for it's easy to forget what other people want when you are so fired up about your plans. Your key to success now is taking the time to see things from a variety of perspectives."
taurus,2015-02-06,"You crave attention now and want to be appreciated for all that you do. It is easy to feel unrecognized, but your perceptions aren't necessarily based on reality today. Instead of putting on a song and dance, hoping that others will notice you, just soak in the current dynamics without laying your expectations on top of everything. It may be awkward at first, but as long as you don't ask to be the star of the show, you can get the recognition you need."
gemini,2015-02-06,"Your ideas may be so outrageous now that others wonder if you've temporarily lost your way. If you are called upon to give a five-minute presentation, you will likely have fifteen minutes of solid material. You are eager to commit more resources than you have at your disposal. Just keep in mind that your scope of vision is widened far beyond your normal view today. Consciously narrowing your focus greatly improves your chances for success."
cancer,2015-02-06,"There's a hard-to-define distinction between following your dreams and tending to your current priorities. It's easy to close your eyes and see the world as a perfect place now, but your vision may only exist in the realm of fantasy. You can set yourself up for disappointment, since your illusions will eventually collide with reality. If you maintain a practical approach to reaching your goals, you will have the potential to be truly inspirational."
leo,2015-02-06,"Although you might believe you're being very concise in your message, your ideas are so big now that others miss your point completely. It's as if your meaning is lost in the translation and all that comes across is your heightened sense of urgency. However, if you temper your hopes and dreams with a bit of hard cold reality, you can  avoid creating any confusion. Speak less and listen more; this rather uncomplicated strategy could not only save the day, you may learn something eye-opening in the process."
virgo,2015-02-06,"You routinely expend a fair amount of energy making sure that all the details are in place, but now every little task takes more time than you expect. Distractions, however pleasurable, pull at your attention from every direction. You may as well abandon your previous plans and just do the best you can to navigate the chaos. Be easy on yourself; whatever isn't completed today can always be finished up later on. Even you virtuous Virgos deserve a bit of respite from responsibility."
libra,2015-02-06,"The more you try to explain your motives today, the less sense you make. Nevertheless, you have a strong desire to garner support from your loved ones and are ready to take extreme measures to get others on your side. If you truly want to be seen in a clear light and appreciated for who you are, unfold your story step by step instead of spilling all the beans at once. Sharing your dreams with someone worthy of your confidence can be a magical journey if you slow down and do it right."
scorpio,2015-02-06,"People at work keep you on your toes today, for their ideas seem to be more ambitious than yours. Listening to others talking about their hopes inspires you to aim higher when making your own plans. In fact, you might feel so confident that you attempt something you've never done before. However, it's prudent to scale back your commitments even if others are encouraging you to take on more. Unfortunately, following someone else's dreams can only set you up for disappointment. Ultimately, you're the only one who knows what your heart truly needs."
sagittarius,2015-02-06,"Although you may be an optimistic person, today you take things to a new level and are a case study in the power of positive thinking. But even if you believe the world is your playground, you're still being tugged in opposite directions. On one hand, you're ready to bail on your responsibilities and spend the day in the pursuit of pleasure. On the other hand, you are fully aware of the needs of those around you and are willing to do whatever you must to help them. Your altruism is admirable but your mission is to find a way to merge the two divergent paths into one."
capricorn,2015-02-06,"You have a crucial role to play today on the job or at school. Your current willingness to work with others encourages them on their personal quests. Your panoramic vision enables you to see how an individual's agenda fits into the larger scheme of things. Nevertheless, you must manage your enthusiasm because your words may inadvertently inspire someone to take on more than they can handle. Tone down your exuberance a notch and you just might end up being a real live superhero."
aquarius,2015-02-06,"Your friends may caution you about the dangers of taking the easy way out of your responsibilities. Nevertheless, your mind is not on work today; your thoughts are consumed by a variety of more intriguing options. Although your exit plan might not be a graceful one, you can squeeze in a bit of extra fun now, even if others disapprove. The trick is to find a middle ground so you don't go overboard in your search for a good time. Moderation is the key to staying out of trouble."
pisces,2015-02-06,"Your coworkers express their needs to you in a dramatic fashion today, but their overblown presentations don't necessarily help you understand exactly what they want. You would like to support them, but the more you listen, the less sense it all makes. Don't be afraid to ask for specifics so that you can make a decision based upon your own priorities. Putting in a little due diligence empowers you to choose with a clear conscience."
aries,2015-02-07,"You try to please others today, but even your best intentions are not good enough if your behavior seems abrasive. Your emotions may run so deep now that it's healthier to err on the side of caution than to reveal your feelings to others. Although you can wait until tomorrow when everyone is less sensitive, you could begin to open up right away as long as you remember to move slowly. Giving your friends the space to integrate what you say is a more thoughtful approach."
taurus,2015-02-07,"Managing relationship dynamics is more complicated than you expect today. Although you might be able to tell there's a lot going on beneath the surface, finding your way through potentially explosive emotional landmines could be tricky business. Don't stick with an agenda that isn't working; instead, respond to each situation as it develops. You can always return to your unresolved issues tomorrow when the coast is clear. Authentic communication doesn't have to be volatile if you consider everyone's feelings right from the start."
gemini,2015-02-07,"Your underlying motives might not be as altruistic as they seem, even if you go out of your way to put others at ease now. However, there's nothing wrong with your desire to be admired by someone you like, especially since you're more productive when you feel appreciated. You fall into the communication flow when there's a healthy balance of give and take. Nevertheless, the best kind of love is offered without keeping score of what you receive in return."
cancer,2015-02-07,"Even if you believe everything is unfolding naturally today, someone close to you may still think you're too controlling. But any manipulative behavior is probably motivated by your fear of someone taking advantage of you. However, there is some truth to both sides; if you can become comfortable with any outcome to the current situation, the need for power struggles dissipates. Building trust is more important now than reaching your final destination."
leo,2015-02-07,"You may obsess about what you're going to do today, but over-planning is likely a waste of time. You could misread the dynamics of a situation and make a faulty assumption by relying on wrong data. Or, perhaps, the circumstances might change without warning, turning your entire schedule upside down. It doesn't matter whether or not you were ever really in charge; unresolved tensions relax when you finally let go of control. Sharing power shakes up the energy and increases your chances of success."
virgo,2015-02-07,"There is no need to overreact if someone makes unreasonable demands of you today. Your best  strategy is to push back with a firm but gentle touch. Mischievous Mercury is still backpedaling in your 6th House of Routine, so misunderstandings might easily creep into the picture if you respond too quickly. Take your time and consider the feelings of others before creating ripples that will spread on their own. Clear communication is key for creating more harmonious relationships."
libra,2015-02-07,"It might seem as if your friends are not being very supportive of your goals at first, but your worries could be unfounded. You may have too much on your mind and too many leftover chores weighing on your shoulders to be objective. But don't expect everyone to rush to your rescue now, just because you're under pressure. Luckily, sticking to your initial plan will actually help you handle your personal obligations on your own. Take pride in your current self-sufficiency, and earn a few admirers along the way."
scorpio,2015-02-07,"Your energy reserve may be on empty today, making you feel rather frazzled if you can't establish a steady work pace. Something slipped just slightly out of alignment and it could take a conscious attitude adjustment on your part to snap your thinking back into place. You're due for a break from whatever you're doing; anything that changes your focus in a healthy way should also help you regain your natural rhythm and passion for life."
sagittarius,2015-02-07,"Saving your pennies isn't your idea of fun, but you wouldn't have to pay attention to your finances today if you took care of your personal business yesterday. You wish you could kick back and fantasize about the unrealized potential in your life and concoct long-term plans, but an immediate cash flow problem demands that you handle it right away. Don't put off the inevitable; the sooner you get started, the sooner you can return to manifesting your dreams."
capricorn,2015-02-07,"You can't decide whether to push ahead more forcefully now or if it's smarter to temporarily retreat. Frustration sets in if you wish you took a different course of action. But what you do next might not matter so much; rest assured there isn't any right or wrong way to go from here. Either way, your path may be temporarily obscured. Your wisest strategy is to bide your time until you receive a clear sign from the universe that tells you which direction to take. Even you ambitious Mountain Goats deserve a day of fun every now and then."
aquarius,2015-02-07,"Your dreams contain messages, whether you remember them as soon as you wake up or if they return as fragmented images throughout the day. However, it's wiser to proceed with caution because your fantasies seem so real that they can lead you on a wild goose chase. Don't just assume that you have enough information now to discern the difference between fact and fancy. Considering these are the last days of Mercury retrograde, maintain a wait-and-see attitude until your clarity returns."
pisces,2015-02-07,"Your intuition is operating on warp drive now, making you even more attuned to other dimensions. In fact, you might even feel as if you're living your life within a dream. However, something weird happens that wakes you up today, reminding you to be more practical when it comes to your priorities. You may not be completely comfortable during this drastic transition, but applying your common sense in the present moment could save you from disappointment later on. Combining both worlds places you in a position of power."
aries,2015-02-08,"Other people may be sitting on fences today and nothing you say or do seems to be enough to push them one way or the other. Rather than working yourself into a state of frustration, stop and reevaluate your part in creating this uncomfortable predicament. In fact, your insecurity might be more of a problem now than another person's ambivalence. There's nothing to be gained by forcing a decision prematurely. Remember, you tend to lead the pack; give others the time to make their own choices at their own pace."
taurus,2015-02-08,"You're concerned that you could miss an exciting opportunity if you don't take proactive steps and share what's on your mind immediately. However, your sense of urgency might not be supported by the facts. Although you may be prone to overreact today, time still could be running out -- just not as quickly as you think. Your enthusiasm is contagious, yet slowing down the delivery of your message increases your chances for success."
gemini,2015-02-08,"Normally, you have the quickest wit in the room, but you could grow anxious today if you can't process your ideas as fast as they pop up. For brief moments you're so sure of yourself that you're likely to jump to erroneous conclusions. Instead of attempting to integrate every thought that surfaces, weigh the relative importance of each idea so you can let go of the less important ones. It's currently more crucial to set sensible priorities than trying to follow every whim. Thankfully, having a practical plan in place inspires you to keep on track."
cancer,2015-02-08,"Your changing feelings about a family matter are easily misinterpreted today by someone who thinks you don't care enough to choose a side. But the nurturing Moon's visit to your 4th House of Domestic Conditions indicates that nothing could be further from the truth. In fact, you may be quite sympathetic to more than one solution, so inform those you love of your current thoughts to avoid any further misunderstandings. There is no hurry to make a decision as long as you're being perfectly honest and allowing others to do the same."
leo,2015-02-08,"You may be cast in the role of a peacemaker today, acting as a shuttle diplomat that goes back and forth between the disagreeing parties. Even if you have your own opinions, keep them to yourself for the sake of harmony. Don't let anyone trick you into taking sides or you could lose your neutrality, along with your ability to assist others in establishing common ground. Your enlightened compassion is the foundation on which others can build understanding."
virgo,2015-02-08,"It's not your top priority to convince others to accept your beliefs, but this doesn't mean you're a pushover if someone tries to persuade you to support a different point of view. However, you might surprise a friend or associate by how quickly you can shut down in order to defend your core values if you're feeling cornered. Ultimately, letting others know your limits right from the start is a better strategy than overcompensating after the fact. Standing your ground is easier than you think."
libra,2015-02-08,"You could believe everything is copacetic with a friend or relative, only to discover that you overlooked an essential fact. Meanwhile, others may lose patience with you because they incorrectly assumed you already knew the truth. However, it really doesn't matter whether the error was of your making or if information was purposefully withheld. What's most important now is that you learn from your mistakes and then move on. There's no substitute for the wisdom of experience."
scorpio,2015-02-08,"You often have more going on behind the scenes than others know about, and today you can take this complexity to an entirely new level. Flashing a smile to cover deeper concerns may not seem honest, yet it's still an effective coping mechanism to make it through the day. You will have an opportunity to clear the air of hidden emotions soon enough, but for now, there's no need to rush the moment. In the meantime, continue to observe your shifting emotional landscape without feeling the need to share your thoughts until you're ready."
sagittarius,2015-02-08,"Although you may already have exciting plans in place, the future is not set in stone. In fact, the Moon's presence in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals indicates there are multiple possibilities on the horizon. You're not tied to one specific outcome anymore, so feel free to envision a variety of adventures in your mind before choosing one to make real. Exploring fantasies about your great escape is the first step to making it a reality. Plant the seeds of tomorrow in your dreams today."
capricorn,2015-02-08,"Playing it cool may not convey what is actually in your heart today. Although you prefer to demonstrate your objectivity and detachment, people could misunderstand your understated approach now, assuming that you care more about your ambitions than about your home and family. Fortunately, you can remain fully engaged without having to be overly emotional. Just be sure to let others know that they mean the world to you while you have the chance."
aquarius,2015-02-08,"Someone close to you might say something that strikes you as rather odd today. You may try to let it go, but you still could become stuck on this awkward moment until you determine the source of your angst. Remember, you don't have to wait for a question to grow into a full-blown problem before you handle it. Express your concerns as they arise, instead of walking away from a potentially uncomfortable discussion. Facing the music is easier the sooner you do it; honesty creates harmony."
pisces,2015-02-08,"Understanding other people's motives is nearly impossible now, for they only offer you specific parts of the big picture. Although useful information may be lurking beneath the surface, you're not interested in spending your precious time peeling layers of the onion just to get to the core. Instead of looking for answers you don't have yet, just work with what you already know. Trusting your intuition is what you Fish do best."
aries,2015-02-09,"You can tell that your most important relationships are evolving, but you still might feel that your forward progress is impeded as interactive Mercury approaches the end of its retrograde period on Wednesday. You may attempt to focus on your work but your mind is wandering around in another dimension today, trying to remember a dream that seems important for some unknown reason. Set aside a block of time to meditate since your subconscious has important messages to reveal now if you're willing to stop and listen."
taurus,2015-02-09,"You know that there is still plenty of work to do, but the long-term outlook appears so rosy that you could get lazy about meeting your current obligations. However, don't wait until it's too late to put your legendary determination to good use. Finding new sources of motivation is key to your success, because if you don't do it, no one's going to do it for you. Claim your power and use it for the good of all."
gemini,2015-02-09,"Buzzing around like a busy bee sounds like a legitimate way to spend your time today, but it's challenging to accomplish as much as you wish. Thankfully, an unexpected energetic surge propels you to prepare for Mercury's direct turn on February 11. Rather than initiating new projects, shift your priorities to completing as many unfinished tasks as possible. Although you might feel frustrated because you cannot do everything you want, it's easier to tie up loose ends now than in the weeks ahead. Nevertheless, mapping out your plans in your imagination sets the stage for the future."
cancer,2015-02-09,"The fevered pace at work may be a lot to handle now, but luckily, the intensity could begin to settle down later in the week. Nevertheless, it's helpful to take some time away from the chaos today. Explore new avenues for growth, rather than only showing up at your job and doing what's expected. Having a good strategy in place empowers you to meet the challenges ahead while also offering you the chance to pursue a new opportunity."
leo,2015-02-09,"You wish you could be footloose and fancy-free today, yet you cannot justify taking time off when there are so many things to do. Complaining about your chores won't help since it only shifts your attitude into a negative space. Take a deep breath and imagine fulfilling your obligations effortlessly and then being free to joyfully follow your bliss. If you can clearly visualize the results of your hard work, it will be easier to accomplish what is most important. A subtle change of perspective puts a positive spin on your day."
virgo,2015-02-09,"Methodically checking off items on your to-do list one at a time produces its own unique brand of satisfaction. However, now you wish you could just spend the day hanging out with a special friend. Your dreams linger on your mind now and you can't help but fantasize about your secret life as a rock star, dancer or artist. Although you've left your natural practicality behind now, it's not wise to abandon your responsibilities. Take care of business today and follow your heart tomorrow."
libra,2015-02-09,"It seems as if you are being pushed and pulled between extreme likes and dislikes, and you can't anchor yourself in the real world. Your desire to navigate a more moderate course is complicated by the evocative Moon's current visit to your sign. Unfortunately, rapidly fluctuating moods make it nearly impossible to hide your emotions for long. Even if you pretend that everything is okay, others can see through your facade now. Stop resisting the ebb and flow of your heart; those who matter most will accept you just as you are."
scorpio,2015-02-09,"Releasing unrealistic expectations can lead to a new lease on love now that sensual Venus hooks up with healing Chiron in your 5th House of Romance. Nevertheless, you might keep your feelings to yourself because you don't want to appear vulnerable. It's tempting to mask your heart by dazzling others with your ingenious ideas. But you're probably less interested in turning your thoughts into reality than using them as a smokescreen. Ironically, expressing your emotions is ultimately more productive than burying them."
sagittarius,2015-02-09,"It's a perfect day to spend time with friends, catch up on the past and talk about the future. Although you thrive conversing about the variety of interesting subjects, discussions can suddenly take you into totally unexpected directions. Don't try to control the topic of a conversation now; you might be pleasantly surprised by what comes up and where it leads if you're willing to go with the flow. You can find inspiration in the most unlikely places."
capricorn,2015-02-09,"You often seem as steady as a rock, which encourages other people to rely on your dependability. Although you want to live up to your reputation, your promises can be much bigger now than your ability to fulfill them. Consider your motives; if you're accepting new professional challenges so someone will like you, think again before saying yes. However, if your commitment is truly for the benefit of all involved, nothing will stand between you and your goals."
aquarius,2015-02-09,"The more you try to explain yourself today, the less clear your message becomes. Instead of wasting time struggling with this communication dilemma, just let it pass naturally. Others might see you as an impractical dreamer now, but it's only a temporary phase. You'll likely be back to your rational self tomorrow and once again everyone will know where you stand. In the meantime, let your imagination wander wherever it wants and see what treasures it discovers."
pisces,2015-02-09,"You're eager to find the lighter side of each moment today, but everyone else seems annoyingly serious. You could grow frustrated if your associates want you to be more thoughtful about how you prioritize your time now. Although you understand their feelings, you still may resist their efforts to change your plans. Reassure everyone involved that once you recharge your batteries you will return to your obligations with renewed enthusiasm. Play now, work later."
aries,2015-02-10,"Managing your schedule is complicated today because seeing things in a clear light is nearly impossible. Although you want to get to the truth, you don't have the time or energy to pursue answers through endless analysis. It doesn't matter whether or not you even have a long-term plan; just set your goals high and do what you can to reach them. Any kind of productive behavior now is more useful than dreaming about what you could do sometime in the future. He who hesitates is lost."
taurus,2015-02-10,"You may be under the false illusion that people are giving you a hard time but, surprisingly, they rush to your rescue if you need their support. However, you must be open to graciously accept what others are offering now, or you could miss an opportunity to receive help over a rough spot. There's no reason to show your superiority, especially when your perspective is out of whack. Don't let pride stand between you and the love that's all around you."
gemini,2015-02-10,"No matter how determined you are to have a good time today, you're still likely to feel overwhelmed by all that's expected of you. Although you may have a plan in hand, sticking to it is no easy matter. The best bet is to just do whatever seems most important minute by minute along the way. Unfortunately, your time is running out. You can have fun another day; put your best foot forward now by finishing one task before beginning another. You may be happily surprised by how much you can accomplish if you start small and work hard."
cancer,2015-02-10,"Taking your mind off work may be tricky business these days, but your desires could drive you to distraction, whether or not they are convenient. Unfortunately, ignoring your feelings isn't a viable option now because they remain persistent, especially if you resist them. Surrendering to the inevitable is more sensible than trying to avoid it. Letting your emotions flow naturally allows your fears to transform into trust -- which, in turn, paves the way to a higher level of productivity."
leo,2015-02-10,"Although you might not have an obvious reason to be more self-confident today, it feels as if you are being guided by a benevolent mysterious force. Nothing is gained by questioning whether or not this ethereal assistance is real, so just listen to your intuition with an open mind. No matter how you choose to rationalize your current experience, rest assured that acting on a hunch that's good for everyone involved is surely the right thing to do."
virgo,2015-02-10,"You're not ready to trust your choices today because you think you're missing a piece of the puzzle, but gathering additional information isn't the answer, either. Nevertheless, you still may want to do more research or, at least seek out the benefit of other people's advice. Even if you're concerned about the current conflict between your head and your heart, it's time to take a risk and let your passion guide you. Forget about finding logical justifications for something you already want to do. Follow your instincts now, for they will lead you in the right direction."
libra,2015-02-10,"Sharing your vision of the future is a powerful catalyst for your friends and associates today. However, no one is interested in receiving more data now, so spouting facts and figures to defend your fantasies is a waste of energy. If you attempt to coerce others to support your plans, they may end up making empty promises just to placate you. Don't rely on anyone else to make your dreams come true when you have all the tools at your disposal to do it yourself."
scorpio,2015-02-10,"There's no reason to add more stress to an already delicate situation, but your forthright response could be tough for someone to handle, anyway. On one hand, everything might seem more difficult than it has to be today. On the other hand, you're willing to follow an over-complicated plan because you have a very clear trajectory in mind, even if it's an unpopular one. Fortunately, you have the ability to elevate the overall mood by simply choosing to acknowledge the good in everything and everyone."
sagittarius,2015-02-10,"You want others to see you shining brightly in the best possible light today because you believe your actions are a source of inspiration. Luckily, you can keep far enough ahead of everyone else now that you appear to be a natural born leader. Fortunately, you don't have to do anything differently from what you have already done in the past. You have the most profound influence if you consistently act on your feelings with honesty and integrity."
capricorn,2015-02-10,"Calculating your options and weighing the various pros and cons to your ambitious plans is your top priority now. Naturally, you want to make the best choices, but the most sensible course of progress grows more complicated with the crosscurrents from other people's opinions. Even if your closest friends and allies are on your side, they might withdraw emotionally once they realize that there's little for them to do. Fortunately, you are feeling more confident day by day, enabling you to continue a reassessment of your goals while waiting out the confusion."
aquarius,2015-02-10,"You're anxious to assume a leadership position today because you intuitively know what needs to happen next. Unfortunately, those around you aren't so quick to relinquish their power now. Caution is advised; you can't just command an authoritative role in order to demonstrate your competence. Avoid direct confrontation at all costs; fortunately, you can use your ingenuity to find an indirect route to achieve your objectives. Creativity is your friend."
pisces,2015-02-10,"Miracles aren't likely to happen out of the blue, even if you woke up anticipating something special today. Nevertheless, serious healing magic can suddenly unfold right before your eyes as long as you don't try to force anything on your own. Above all, don't push your perspective on anyone else. Swim like a Fish in a school and, for now, take the course of least resistance. You might be happily surprised by the power in numbers."
aries,2015-02-11,"Friends might attempt to entice you to go on a little adventure today, and you are more than ready to follow their lead. Be sure to examine all the facts first, whether it's a social engagement or a business venture, since you could be so eager to dive in that you're fully involved before you know the whole deal. Employing a little common sense can save you from having to untangle yourself from a complicated mess. Aries rush in where angels fear to tread."
taurus,2015-02-11,"Even the simplest act can turn into something very wonderful, but it could also grow into more than you want. Your friend or partner may get bent out of shape if you don't deliver on your promises. Normally, your determination would be enough to get you through, but today you are better off by consciously restraining from taking on too much. Realistically evaluating the size of any project before making a commitment is the most reliable route to success."
gemini,2015-02-11,"Life seems to present you with many lovely possibilities, but you need to be careful about saying yes to everything.Even though you see yourself as the supreme champion of multitasking, this is not the best time to spread yourself too thin. Distractions may lead you down a most enjoyable path for a while, but you have too much at stake to be unproductive today. Concentrate your energy and your intentions will bring the positive results you seek."
cancer,2015-02-11,"Your feelings are a source of strength today as the emotional Scorpio Moon harmonizes with vulnerable Venus in watery Pisces. But it's more complicated to integrate your changing moods with your thoughts because the Moon squares the Sun. Although sharing your heart with a close friend sounds like a good idea, you might choose to clam up instead of saying anything. Even if someone pressures you to talk, exercise your free will by setting clear boundaries and revealing your inner process only when you are ready."
leo,2015-02-11,"Discord between your actions and your feelings may be the primary source of stress today. You know what you need, but are unable to express your heartfelt desires easily at this time. However, when you do finally tell others what you want, your tendency is to go overboard and say too much. Pay close attention to how people react to your requests and use their feedback to guide you through the rest of the day. When in doubt, err on the side of caution."
virgo,2015-02-11,"Something intangible may be missing from your life today, even if you feel loved by those closest to you. It's not that you're being unreasonable in your demands; it's just that you know exactly what you want and aren't willing to settle for anything less. Nevertheless, your dissatisfaction can dissipate if you lighten up  and are gentle with others. Remember, other people are probably doing the best that they can -- just like you. Sometimes perfection is an unattainable illusion that stands in the way of your happiness."
libra,2015-02-11,"You're inclined to proudly display your feathers today as big old Jupiter encourages the Moon to strut her stuff. Nevertheless, you may feel conflicted because you want to be appreciated, yet you really don't want to draw too much attention your way. You might be afraid that others will notice the inconsistencies between your head and your heart. Muster up a bit of courage and face your fear; let those you love see you in your truest colors."
scorpio,2015-02-11,"You might slip into a temporary funk as the tumultuous Scorpio Moon intensifies your emotions. However, you won't sink too deep now with the Moon aligning with jovial Jupiter and the radiant Sun. Thankfully, it's not difficult to transform any negative emotional patterns into positive ones today. Journey within to do your spiritual work, but don't forget to return to your center to receive the benefits of your process."
sagittarius,2015-02-11,"Finding that magical balance between rigid pessimism and blind optimism is a bit of a trick today as you're drawn to react with extreme intensity either way. The heavy Scorpio Moon squares buoyant Jupiter, placing you in the middle of a cosmic tug of war. But even if you are unsure of the outcome, taking a risk and expressing your emotions can turn an uncomfortable situation into one based on love and support. A simple disclosure on your part sets a positive example for others."
capricorn,2015-02-11,"Handling your friends' emotional intensity may be quite stressful now, especially if they have strong opinions that sound non-negotiable. Even if you try to maintain a positive attitude, you might not be able to reason with them. Your best tactic now is to sidestep conflicts over trivial issues, saving your interactions for things that truly matter. Instead, practice the art of compromise and focus on the common ground that you share."
aquarius,2015-02-11,"It seems as if every area of your life is touched by trickster Mercury's direct turn in your sign. Interactions with friends and family may get tied up in misunderstandings or, perhaps, a conversation just takes much longer than you expect. You might not be sure you can live up to other people's demands. However, you could be feeling leftover stress from the hectic pace earlier in the week. Nevertheless, you see bright glimpses of hope on the horizon. Staying flexible enables you to successfully ride the waves of opportunity in the days ahead."
pisces,2015-02-11,"This could be a momentous day if you stay in touch with your imagination, but the possibility of being overwhelmed by mundane issues is likely. Nevertheless, the most productive path now is defined by your dreams and not your immediate responsibilities. Naturally, you can't ignore what's on your plate in the present moment, but you can change your attitude and consciously let go of your resistance today. You don't have to surrender your dreams if you remember that you're fully capable of simultaneously walking in both worlds."
aries,2015-02-12,"Naturally, you might wish previous commitments weren't weighing you down today, but there's no escape from fulfilling your obligations. The optimistic Sagittarius Moon encourages you to dream larger than life, but you still could appear irresponsible to someone else who thinks you should focus on the tasks at hand. Don't push your luck. You could get all you want and more if you eliminate the excess noise and take care of business. Channeling your enthusiasm into your work is your ticket to success."
taurus,2015-02-12,"Although you're distracted with big ideas about your future, it's critical to rein in your unrealistic fantasies and be as practical as possible today. It's tempting to ride your adrenaline rush and grab an opportunity that seems to offer big rewards in return. But things look better than they actually are, so it's sensible to set aside your hopes for immediate gratification and work toward improving your stability in the present moment. A carefully made choice now will ensure a happier outcome later."
gemini,2015-02-12,"You're not looking forward to buckling down and doing exactly what's expected of you today, yet this isn't an ideal time to reveal your true feelings by rebelling against authority. You may attempt to sidestep an unpleasant activity now, but you could just create additional problems if you run out on your obligations. Even if others tempt you with an intriguing invitation, save the fun and games for another day and hold up your end of the bargain. You might be surprised by the sense of pride you feel when you look back at your accomplishments."
cancer,2015-02-12,"You may resist the idea of working closely with someone today, but you could be persuaded to venture out of your safety zone no matter what kind of defensive tactics you employ. Instead of jumping through hoops to set up unnecessary roadblocks, soften your self-protective posture and be open to what others have to offer. It's more useful to stay connected with your feelings now than to deny your emotions just because they make you feel insecure. The discomforts of  vulnerability are outweighed by the advantages of collaboration."
leo,2015-02-12,"Your generosity of spirit is appreciated by those who come into contact with you today because your positive attitude can be quite contagious. However, there may be an emotionally charged agenda that creates disagreement among friends and coworkers. Rather than declaring your position and then fighting for it, avoid becoming too attached to any one outcome. Go ahead and make a choice if you must, but be willing to meet others halfway. Common ground is built on mutual respect."
virgo,2015-02-12,"You may have a highly productive day in store, providing you can steer clear of conflicts with authorities. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently provoke a power struggle by doing something your own way. You should be able to minimize stress now if you remain sincere in your intentions and follow through to the best of your abilities. Thankfully, there's no need to prove your proficiency today; lessen the pressure by balancing your work with a little bit of lighthearted fun."
libra,2015-02-12,"You might have assumed that you were directing the show today, but it turns out that you're not the one calling the shots. You may run into someone who thinks he's the boss, yet it's difficult to uncover the whole story about who is in charge. Instead of putting up a fight, just go with the flow while the drama unfolds. Be a careful observer of the dynamics behind the scenes but don't try to make any changes just yet. Once the bigger picture becomes clear, you will intuitively know  what to do next."
scorpio,2015-02-12,"You thought you could finish everything that's expected of you, but your confidence may begin to wane as the day wears on. Fortunately, you can still come through with the goods today because you are motivated by the fact that everyone is depending on you. If necessary, you know how to push your limits to meet your deadlines. Don't be afraid to demonstrate what you can do. However, nothing will be gained by judging anyone else too harshly just because you're the model of efficiency now. Don't waste time comparing anyone's level of productivity to yours when you could be celebrating your success, instead."
sagittarius,2015-02-12,"Maintaining your confidence is critical today because the Moon joins somber Saturn in your 1st House of Personality. You may experience delays or encounter unexpected obstacles, creating bouts of self-doubt. Thankfully, this conjunction is in exuberant Sagittarius, offering some balance if you're willing to eliminate superfluous activities. You're better off if there are fewer tasks on your to-do list now so you have more time for each item. Creating a realistic agenda for yourself enables you to show others the meaning of success."
capricorn,2015-02-12,"You may have several impulsive moments today when you are all too eager to pursue a fleeting whim. However, don't let your desire for instant gratification hijack your day. Even if you want to do the right thing, you're also keeping your eyes peeled for a quick escape. Remember, your key planet Saturn presents you with an extra load of responsibility. Fortunately, concentrating on your commitment to excellence soothes your current wanderlust, enabling you to settle down and be more productive than you ever imagined."
aquarius,2015-02-12,"You're willing to put in long hours and work hard because you want to be considered an integral part of the team. However, you might go out of your way to appear easygoing because you don't want anyone to know how seriously you take yourself now. Ironically, you could sabotage your success by trying too hard. Consciously relaxing just a bit may be enough to let your true nature shine through so others can see the real value of your contributions."
pisces,2015-02-12,"You are driven to demonstrate your competence at work today and go out of your way to fulfill any promises you made. Nevertheless, it's not easy to keep on task with so many planets drifting through your sign these days. You can find additional stability from your interactions with others, but you also need to express your dreams, too. Don't deny your creative and imaginative side. Thankfully, concentrating on your outer goals doesn't require you to ignore your inner world."
aries,2015-02-13,"You may be bored with your daily routine and are tempted to do something drastic about it today. Fortunately, you can get away with making changes that only a few days ago would have created problems. Don't let a current opportunity slip through your fingers. Pushing for short-term gratification now doesn't necessarily prevent you from establishing long-term goals as well. Working both ends of the time spectrum increases your odds of achieving success."
taurus,2015-02-13,"Aiming high is admirable, yet you may be too ambitious for your own good today. Reaching too far sets you up for failure and you could lose sight of what you can actually accomplish. If you fall short of your objectives, don't try to shift the blame to anyone else. Just temporarily scale back your goals and try again. Hitting your mark builds confidence and empowers you to strive for something more. You can produce great results if you're willing to start small and work from there."
gemini,2015-02-13,"You might feel slighted as the spotlight of appreciation shines on everyone except you while the Moon is traveling through your 7th House of Others. But don't lose sight of the fact that the real lessons come from confronting your feelings, and not from unconsciously projecting them on to those around you. Acknowledge your reactions to current circumstances as entirely your own; your behavior is ultimately more significant now than what someone else says or does. Fate is what happens to you while free will is how you respond."
cancer,2015-02-13,"You normally prefer contemplation prior to action, but you're likely to say you can do something now before you even consider the actual steps. Thankfully, you can always renegotiate a promise if your enthusiasm gets the best of you. It is far better to be straightforward and let everyone know what's going on as soon as you realize you are over-committed. No one will fault you as long as you're honest and diligently try to fulfill your obligations. Although you might not be able to move mountains today, your efforts certainly won't go unappreciated."
leo,2015-02-13,"You have excess nervous energy that has nowhere to go today. Unfortunately, if you can't find a way to express it in a healthy manner, you could suddenly lose your temper for no reason at all. However, undertaking a complex project that demands all of your focus is a perfect outlet for your adrenaline. Don't worry about finishing everything you start now; just jump in and get the ball rolling. Your plans will magically come together once you are in motion. Thinking on your feet works in your favor when everything in your world is moving so fast."
virgo,2015-02-13,"Normally, you have more than your fair share of common sense at your disposal, but you seem to have misplaced your sound judgment today. You're striving for a more unconventional approach to a solution, but you may not be able to logically justify your radical ideas. Fortunately, your intuition is probably right on track. Instead of wasting precious time and energy explaining your every move, just do what seems the most expedient. Acting on your instincts now is your most reliable path to success."
libra,2015-02-13,"Your plan to catch up on all the little things that you recently let slide makes it difficult to relax now. But your good intentions may not be enough to shift you into the right gear. Although you know what you must do to reach your destination, all you really want to do is chill. Nevertheless, don't postpone your chores. Making smart use of your time in the present moment is the quickest way to get the rest you seek."
scorpio,2015-02-13,"You may be considering acquiring something you have wanted for a while. However, it wouldn't hurt to do another round of research now that the purchase date is getting closer. You might have set very high expectations, yet suddenly are surprised at how much everything costs. Don't needlessly stress about money because practicality will win out over fantasy soon enough. In the meantime, indulge your dreams because they encourage you to step beyond the status quo and into the unknown."
sagittarius,2015-02-13,"Everyone seems to know your story before you say a word today, prompting you to feel emotionally vulnerable. Nevertheless, the cavalier Sagittarius Moon is hanging out in your 1st House of Personality, putting your emotions right out in the open for all to see. But rather than worrying about someone's opinion of you, change your frame of reference and enjoy being recognized for who you truly are. There is no reason to hide once you remember that your fearless heart is your greatest strength."
capricorn,2015-02-13,Today it's a great idea to change your plans to include a bit of rest and recreation. You expend a lot of energy meeting your obligations and acting responsibly in your daily life. There's nothing wrong with wanting to kick back and take some downtime or run off with your friends. All work and no play isn't a healthy way to live; it's much better to embrace your desires and give yourself permission to unwind while you have the chance.
aquarius,2015-02-13,"Today you long for some good old-fashioned fun. However, you could have so many social activities scheduled that they become more like chores rather than play. The friendly Sagittarius Moon illuminates your 11th House of Friends, making it nearly impossible for you to turn down an invitation. However, selectively eliminating a few invitations now clears your calendar and gives you a better chance for enjoyment. Sometimes the idea that less is more makes sense."
pisces,2015-02-13,"You naturally take charge today without even realizing it because your intuition is so strong. At first, you may not understand why things unfold so smoothly as circumstances seem to fall in your favor. Thankfully, the Moon harmonizes with your key planet Jupiter, bestowing cosmic good fortune upon you. Nevertheless, you must also do your part by remaining open to all of the opportunities knocking at your door. An adventurous attitude serves you well."
aries,2015-02-14,"You want to balance your obligations with your need for fun and games once the Moon enters responsible Capricorn today. Although your regular routine brings you back down to earth, you're not necessarily willing to let go of the idealistic hopes that still brighten your future. Remain cautious and optimistic at the same time; you can skillfully manage the tension if you stay aware of both extremes while the tightrope is stretched between your desires and your commitments. A delicate balancing act serves you well."
taurus,2015-02-14,"A series of reality checks inspires you to regain your footing in the world. But until you know exactly where you stand, you won't be able to get on with the important business of rearranging your priorities and figuring out what you want to do next. Use this time to create a new strategy or improve a practical plan, and then get busy with the work of making your dreams come true. Reach for the stars but keep your feet on the ground."
gemini,2015-02-14,"You might not be used to taking everything so seriously, but thankfully, you are a fast learner. Even if you try to casually make plans, a carefree attitude won't help your cause now. You must set clear priorities and focus on the most critical issues or you could mistakenly commit to the wrong approach. Don't be afraid to make adjustments as needed. Concentrate your efforts through the early part of the day to get a jump-start on what's to follow. A stitch in time saves nine."
cancer,2015-02-14,"Your day may not flow according to plan, especially if you have to deal with an intense person who seems to enjoy pushing your emotional buttons. Perhaps the drama in a personal relationship becomes too much to handle now, or maybe you have a run-in with an old friend or lover that rattles your nerves. Don't retreat into your shell, even if this interaction is stressful right from the start. Something good will come of your persistence because there is a silver lining even in the darkest of clouds. Respond with love and not with fear."
leo,2015-02-14,"There could be positive movement today if you spend time navigating the twists and turns of a rocky relationship. Although everything may not turn out as you expected, there is a definite upside to the current circumstances. One thing is for sure: whatever path you take requires diligence and patience. There is much to discuss about your future and the more you talk things over now, the easier it will be later on. Take the high road and see who follows."
virgo,2015-02-14,"Contradictory currents wash back and forth across your life, making it nearly impossible to get the clarity you want before moving on today. One minute you're mourning a loss and the next moment you're celebrating a victory. You can sense the potential impact of your actions these days, so you may not be in a very playful mood. Whatever you choose to do, don't let go of the reins. Trust your instincts to know what to do next."
libra,2015-02-14,"There are so many intriguing possibilities on the horizon that you can't help but start the day feeling excited. However, the truth begins to settle in as the day unfolds, and your personal situation may not look as sweet. Don't throw in the towel too quickly, for there's still some serious magic brewing now. Be careful; a defeatist attitude could ruin everything. Your unwavering belief in love is the secret to your happiness."
scorpio,2015-02-14,"Playing a specific role in your family dynamics could help you to feel safe and secure today, but you may not be able to restrain your passion. Fortunately, something happens that makes you realize the power of positive thought more than ever before. But consciously applying your faith isn't enough now; you have to scope out the big picture and decide how to put all the pieces together to achieve the desired results. Think cosmically; act locally."
sagittarius,2015-02-14,"Every road appears to lead to nirvana today, but an explosion of great ideas convinces you that each option is better than it actually is. Thankfully, you still can discern the difference between unrestrained optimism and realistic thinking if you pay attention to the signs. Don't question your intuition now; just listen to your inner voice as it guides you through the current obstacle course  toward your destination. Inspiration is just as important as perspiration when it comes to reaching your goals."
capricorn,2015-02-14,"It seems as if you're being bounced all over the emotional map, but this can be a very auspicious period for you now that the Moon is back in your sign. You prefer to do things your way today, which could involve exerting control over those around you. Even if you are striving toward an honorable goal, you might become so committed to your process that you alienate someone you love. You don't have to be so hard on others in order to motivate them to do their best. Praise works better than criticism almost every time."
aquarius,2015-02-14,"If you have too much on your plate today, it's because you said yes one too many times. Nevertheless, you aren't discouraged by the sacrifices you need to make, nor will any obstacles scare you off. You are convinced that your goals are readily obtainable and you're willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve them. Just remember that emotional stability is slightly elusive now, so don't gamble with your self-respect. Trust your integrity to lead you in the right direction."
pisces,2015-02-14,"The good news is that you are strong enough now to overcome any resistance placed in your path. Although you are a natural-born dreamer, you're also wise in pragmatic ways when it matters most. Employ your imagination to visualize your success as a done deal. But instead of relying on the wings of a prayer to carry you along, organize your resources and climb steadily toward your goal. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
aries,2015-02-15,"You truly believe that you're on the right path to success now, but you might not be ready to make all the sacrifices required to accomplish your objectives. Nevertheless, you could do your share of deep soul-searching today as you consider limiting your ambitions and then eliminating the less realistic parts of your plan. Pragmatic behavior is fine, but don't let anyone talk you out of your dreams. Hold tight to your core beliefs, even as they are honed in the fire of everyday practice."
taurus,2015-02-15,"You are operating with a fixed agenda today and you're not interested in taking on any projects that will distract you from your chosen course. If you have decided to spend the day relaxing, then others might give up on you without even trying to get you to do anything at all. But the truth is that you could be talking tougher than you actually feel. However, there's no need to let your ego get in the way. Don't be afraid to admit that you might be willing to change your mind. It only takes a little bit of flexibility to open your day to possibilities you never even imagined."
gemini,2015-02-15,"Demonstrating your confidence is a piece of cake today, as if you know everything will turn out wonderful. Nevertheless, you're not sharing your secrets now that the emotional Moon is hooking up with possessive Pluto. You may choose to downplay your strong feelings because you're worried that telling all could provoke negative consequences. Unfortunately, your discretion might backfire if others sense you're withholding something significant. There's no reason to hide your passion from those you love."
cancer,2015-02-15,"You can easily get snagged by someone's melodrama hijacking your day when the Moon joins suspicious Pluto in your 7th House of Companions. Although it seems as if it's not really your issue, the intensity of your reaction suggests otherwise. Fortunately, you may be sufficiently grounded now, enabling you to engage in a rational dialogue without being overwhelmed. Nevertheless, give yourself enough time to work through any confusion that you might feel along the way. Personal growth is possible only when you're completely honest with yourself and others."
leo,2015-02-15,"Just when you think you know what's real, the ground beneath your feet shifts once again and you suddenly might not be as certain as you were. The practical Capricorn Moon stabilizes your daily routine, but strange things keep happening now that remind you there's a piece of the puzzle you are missing. You don't have to turn your world upside down today; just remain open to a wide array of unconsidered alternatives and explore all your options before making your next move."
virgo,2015-02-15,"Expressing your conflicting desires to someone you love may seem out of context today, prompting you to keep them to yourself. You might believe your feelings are too raw for others to handle. Although you want to be practical about what you reveal, don't be surprised if you spill the beans anyhow. Unfortunately, you could work yourself into a state of emotional turmoil, even if you start with a trivial disclosure. Thankfully, everything will be fine as long as you don't push for resolution now. Answers will come on their own when the time is right."
libra,2015-02-15,"An uneasy pressure weighs on you today, stemming from a subtle feeling of insecurity that continues to build. However, you can prevent this discomfort by talking about your concerns with a friend and processing whatever is bothering you. However, it's tricky business because the cause of your current malaise may not be so obvious now. Luckily, your willingness to discuss your previously unexpressed emotions helps you move through this period of uncertainty with style and grace."
scorpio,2015-02-15,"You can sense the energy rising, as if the internal pressure in a volcano continues to build. It's prudent to figure out how to let the lava flow without waiting for an inevitable eruption. Take responsibility for your feelings without indiscriminately dumping them on others. However, exerting too much self-control can amplify your emotions. When in doubt, stop and count to ten before saying something you might regret. Finding the right time and place to share what's in your heart makes all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2015-02-15,"Your recent inspirations bump into the reality of other people's emotions today, forcing you to reconsider your current strategy. You may feel as if someone has deflated your balloon and you're quickly losing altitude. Luckily, you won't likely crash to earth because the intensity of the current situation brings out your survival instincts, prompting you to concentrate on finding a fix. Deal with the immediate circumstances first, and then plan your long-term strategy later. Rise to the challenge by showing everyone what you can do in the heat of the moment."
capricorn,2015-02-15,"Although you often hold your feelings in check, your uncharacteristic emotional intensity can be so strong today that people are taken by surprise. Unfortunately, overwhelming others doesn't endear anyone to your cause. It's nearly impossible to get your message across now, unless you tone down the tenor of your words. Utilizing a bit of diplomatic charm goes a long way toward establishing a fruitful dialogue, especially if you want cooperation and not competition."
aquarius,2015-02-15,You may want to remain under the blankets today and let the world slip by unnoticed. But staying home might stunt your emotional process; hiding isn't the best strategy if you want to grow from the current challenges. Practice patience and restrain from rushing in to explain your motives or defend your recent choices. It's your right to explore life's challenges on your own. Don't worry about facing your shadow realms; you will be a stronger person for having searched your soul for answers.
pisces,2015-02-15,"You might be somewhat disillusioned today as powerful feelings flood into awareness. Although this intense roller-coaster ride doesn't last long, it could tire you out and cause you to emotionally close down. It's disconcerting at first if anger begins to replace hope, but you can control how far down the rabbit hole you choose to go. Instead of spiraling into negativity now, consciously reconnect with your vision of the future. Don't let your fear of failure stop you from achieving your highest potential. Spread your wings and fly."
aries,2015-02-16,"It seems as if you must step on the brakes today or you could upset the delicate dynamics around you. The truth is you need take other people's emotions into consideration, even if you think you know what you want. However, you can only put off the inevitable for so long since you won't be satisfied until you try to achieve satisfaction. However, it doesn't matter how important your goals are; the ends don't justify the means. Paradoxically, you are more likely to experience personal fulfillment now if you work for the common good."
taurus,2015-02-16,"It's now time to do something that is indulgent rather than productive, especially if you have been on your best behavior. Although you have specific goals in mind, there's less concern about what you accomplish now and more attention on the anticipation of pleasure. But even if you are conflicted about what's ahead, take a risk and temporarily break free from your obligations. Luckily, you can pick up where you left off in a day or two after you've had your share of fun."
gemini,2015-02-16,"Your deeply-rooted wanderlust can't be resolved so easily now because you can't stop dreaming about your next great adventure. It's time to think about going the full distance, but if this kind of journey is outside of your comfort zone, at least reach as far as you can by learning as much as possible about your desired destination. Making the trip sounds lovely, but what's more important today is that you allow yourself to have an experience that stretches your mind."
cancer,2015-02-16,"You are tired of people piling responsibilities on you and are ready to do something about it. Thankfully, your workload could begin to ease up later today when the Moon leaves your 7th House of Relationships. Although a one-on-one confrontation may temporarily resolve the tension, there are still issues about love that concern you at this time. Avoiding an emotional connection isn't wise, especially if you are afraid of your own feelings. Push against your resistance in order to establish new ways of interacting with others."
leo,2015-02-16,"You are standing on the cusp of a major breakthrough, but can't push yourself any faster than circumstances allow. Your own desires have less to do with the speed of change now than the surrounding events. Remember, frustration stems from your impatience; deep transformation works on its own schedule. The days following Wednesday's New Moon will bring in the next round of opportunities. It's time to move your life ahead with a revitalized sense of purpose."
virgo,2015-02-16,"Your ideas might appear to lack ingenuity today, but they're probably more useful than they seem at first. Remind your coworkers that the best solution to a problem isn't necessarily the flashiest one. Don't panic if no one is interested in pursuing your plan. Instead, take the time to talk them through your thinking so they can see the soundness of your logic. Even your strongest adversaries will soften their resistance to your firm but gentle persistence."
libra,2015-02-16,Having fun shouldn't be hard work but it seems as if the good times are elusive now. Even simple romantic adventures could run into delays while you manage logistical problems. Reality itself seems to get in the way of enjoyment just enough to make you realize what you're missing. Hang in there; this is no time to give up. You can overcome the obstacles no matter how ponderous they seem today.
scorpio,2015-02-16,"You could be worried about one-too-many loose ends unraveling today, but you can make things worse by jumping in and trying to fix things before they break. Nevertheless, this is no time to sit around in an idyllic dream state; there's work to be done and it won't happen on its own without your participation. But don't waste your precious time and energy by running around in circles. A plan built on a cohesive strategy is ultimately wiser than rushing in to save the day."
sagittarius,2015-02-16,"You might be extra chatty today, but you must settle in beneath your distracting stories and tall tales to get in touch with the significant issues of the day. Too much confidence is a liability if it prevents you from seeing your shortcomings. It's time to get real, instead of just smiling your way through the day. Act with maturity and engage fully in discussion about the issues as they surface. Honest discussion will reveal the truth you need to know at this time."
capricorn,2015-02-16,"You are not as afraid to spend your money now, especially if you think you have found an amazing bargain. It's even sweeter if you can buy something original that arouses your sense of beauty. But don't worry about what others like; pay attention to your gut reaction, and express your tastes by purchasing something that is special to you. As time marches on, you might just remember the magical feeling that inspired you to make a special acquisition."
aquarius,2015-02-16,"You have a sinking sensation today as you realize that you've fallen behind schedule and you're not going to finish your work on time. Although others might not understand your dilemma, an incomplete job can loom overhead like a storm cloud blocking the Sun. Nevertheless, a high level of self-confidence kicks in as the reflective Moon returns to your sign later in the day. Don't call it quits, even if you're aware of your current workload. Focusing on the possibilities enables nearly anything to happen."
pisces,2015-02-16,"You might spend more time hanging out at the water cooler than actually getting your work done today. You crave a lot of social contact as the Moon passes through your 11th House of Networking. However, if your job requires you to interact with others, you could be at the top of your game now. Sharing your feelings and dreams with your peers can be quite inspiring as long as it doesn't seriously interfere with your performance. No matter what you do, leading by example motivates everyone to do their best."
aries,2015-02-17,"Cooperation from your friends is a blessing in disguise now because it might also make you anxious if you believe the support comes with conditions. Nevertheless, you are able to work together to solve just about any problem -- even longstanding stubborn ones. You may bring this same productive attitude to organizing social events as well. Just be sure to consider the ramifications of your actions before agreeing to something that's not heartfelt. If you walk your talk today, others will follow."
taurus,2015-02-17,"This may not be the best time to share your feelings; in fact, it might seem as if you missed your chance to take a conversation further. However, emotions have a sneaky way of surfacing over the next couple of days. In the meantime, reflect carefully before going out on a limb and expressing what's in your heart. Avoid getting lost in a negative space by optimistically looking to the future. Counting your blessings realigns your perspective."
gemini,2015-02-17,"There are no limits as to where your innovative mind might travel today. Although intelligent people provide the social stimulation that you need now, you don't want to be stuck with those who are overly serious. Instead, you prefer to hang out with friends and associates who can match your clever repartee and fast wit. You shine the brightest when others appreciate the mental games that you love to play so much."
cancer,2015-02-17,"Drama in a close friendship or intimate relationship may turn your world upside down today. Your emotions are unpredictable and you may not feel like you're standing on solid ground. However, it's possible that the game is changing right before your eyes, so it's not a sensible time to glorify the past. Be brave and cultivate ways of authentically connecting with others. You may be happily surprised with the new landscape if you're willing to let go of old expectations and embrace the future."
leo,2015-02-17,"Don't fall into the trap of believing you are on your own just because others are giving you wide berth today. Use this time to create a new vision of the future without trying to meet everyone's expectations. Fortunately, an individualistic Sun-Uranus alignment allows you to consider unorthodox solutions if it helps you gain freedom. Remember that even if you think you're trapped, you're not; your true friends will support you on your current journey of self-expression. It only takes a little imagination now to rediscover your groove and move on."
virgo,2015-02-17,"You are eager to try ingenious approaches to your work, a favorite hobby or a domestic chore. But first you must toss out the old rules today so you're free to create new ways of executing a familiar task. Keeping an open mind prevents you from becoming bogged down in needless discussions of which method is better. Getting the job done now is more important than being right. Sometimes sticking to your principles stands in the way of your success. Flexibility is your friend."
libra,2015-02-17,"Pursuing playful encounters, romantic interests and artistic endeavors are appropriate expressions of today's cosmic energy. Whether you are interacting with children or just having childish fun, the word of the day is play. However, if you feel as if you're under pressure now, take a short walk to get revitalizing oxygen into your lungs and fresh hope into your life. Anything is possible so keep looking up. Open your heart as wide as possible and bask in the joy of being alive."
scorpio,2015-02-17,"Complex issues could slow you down at home today, but only if you let them. You actually have more choices than you realize now, though it might not feel like it. Don't worry if you aren't thrilled with your current options; it's just a temporary loss of perspective. Everything is about to change, so do whatever you can to bring new energy into your life. Even if you have doubts about your direction, focus on your intentions and concentrate your actions close to home where they matter the most."
sagittarius,2015-02-17,"Put your current state of restlessness to good use today by investigating uncharted territory. You have a taste for the unusual now, so get off the beaten track and discover new pleasures. You can enjoy the fruits of your activities if you consciously seek out fresh stimulation. Be thankful for the unique experiences you encounter that sweep away the cobwebs from the corners of your imagination. Free your mind and the rest will follow."
capricorn,2015-02-17,"You might resent the notion that others are free to be weird and off-the-wall while you Goats are often left behind to be the central core of reason. It's like going through life as the designated driver, but the truth is your dependability encourages others to lean on you when times are tough. Luckily, today's cosmic energy provides you with an opportunity to explore the edges of reality and bring back a few wild ideas of your own. The best part is that people trust your innovative thinking now because they know you don't chase every crazy idea that comes to mind."
aquarius,2015-02-17,"You are still in the throes of wide emotional swings now, especially if you're not happy with some aspect of your personal story. However, someone may offer enough hope today that you start to itch for change. It's more advantageous to choose what will happen than wait for it to choose you. If you attempt to hide inside your cocoon of old habits, something will likely come along to shake up your world. Fortunately, you can pick your adventure first if you're willing to spread your wings and fly."
pisces,2015-02-17,"There are tempting goodies all around you but it seems as if you're not allowed to have them yet. It's like standing in front of a store filled with beautiful things and no way to get inside. Naturally, this dilemma can heighten your frustration, but you have the power to turn the entire situation around now by collecting and storing the images in your mind for future reference. These longings are seed ideas that will grow over the weeks ahead when you water them with action. Think long-term goals rather than short-term gratification."
aries,2015-02-18,"Social activities with friends continue to take on a greater role of importance in the days ahead as the Aquarius New Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Groups. You enthusiastically join with others in the spirit of sharing common ideas and long-term goals. But as much as you wish to be an invaluable member of your community, you aren't willing to give up your independence. Maintaining your treasured individuality while still traveling with the larger pack is easier than you expect."
taurus,2015-02-18,"Your career remains the main focus of your life for the weeks ahead as you look for ways to stabilize the foundation you have already created. But don't stop to rest on your past actions; if you have plans for your future, you must act on them in the present moment. The Aquarius New Moon's presence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility requires you to rally others to follow your lead. There's no need for complex philosophies or convoluted schemes. It's lucky for you that keeping things simple and paying attention to the basics are what you do best."
gemini,2015-02-18,"You're not interested in taking directions from anyone else today. The individualistic Aquarius New Moon rocks your 9th House of Adventure, filling your head with radical ideas about escaping from your responsibilities. The more distance you can now put between you and your routine, the better. Although a plan that seems apparently brilliant in theory may not work in practice, you'll never know unless you try. It's better to attempt the impossible and fall short than to do nothing at all. Focus on what you accomplish rather than on what's left to do."
cancer,2015-02-18,"You are tempted to bury your emotions, but this strategy won't work today because the Aquarius New Moon falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Fortunately, others take you seriously when you speak your truth, even if your message isn't easy to hear. Although your current feelings might not be warm and fuzzy, your honesty conveys a lot about your character. Don't let the possibility of a lasting friendship slip away just because your heart is not all a-flutter. Move closer to good feelings and give them plenty of time to blossom."
leo,2015-02-18,"There's a window of opportunity to make a clean break from some aspect of your life that is no longer serving you well. In addition to leaving something behind, consider what kind of relationships you want to cultivate in your life now. The Aquarius New Moon in your 7th House of Partners indicates there is an exceptional depth to your attractions now and it's wise to take your desires seriously. There is great potential to enter into a joint venture -- romantic or business -- as long as you are clear about your intentions. Above all else, remain true to your heart."
virgo,2015-02-18,"You have no tolerance for boredom today, making it crucial to find new ways of doing the same old job today. At minimum, the Aquarius New Moon's presence in your 6th House of Habits infuses a healthy dose of non-traditional behavior to spice up your daily routine. Even if you want to try something eclectic and unconventional now, you still have the ability to impress others with your reliability and your no-nonsense approach to your responsibilities. However, stepping outside of the box is your secret to success."
libra,2015-02-18,"Today is the day to move a creative project back to the front burner where it belongs. The Aquarius New Moon electrifies your 5th House of Fun and Games, triggering your originality while also inspiring your self-expression. Don't be overly concerned with making a profit, since nearly anything started now has the potential to work out well for you -- even if it takes a while for your investment to pay off. Let your inner artist out to play."
scorpio,2015-02-18,There is an ongoing stress between your desire to connect and your need to be separate. A comfortable blanket of emotional detachment overtakes the details of your day as you move steadily into a new phase of reclaiming your independence. The practical considerations of your personal life are temporarily more important than your feelings while today's logical Aquarius New Moon accentuates your 4th House of Home and Family. Don't worry about your current lack of passion; just enjoy the calmer cosmic weather while you have the chance.
sagittarius,2015-02-18,"You're willing to accept the all-too-sensible restraints currently being placed on your life. The restrictions actually bring relief from the hectic pace now that the Aquarius New Moon agitates your 3rd House of Distractions. But instead of wasting energy on outer-directed events, first try to improve yourself and then watch how reality mirrors your new mental posture. Be the change you want to see in the world."
capricorn,2015-02-18,"The universe is sending mixed signals your way today. On one hand, the Aquarius New Moon in your 2nd House of Values requires you to focus on the most basic concepts so you can build your world on a firm foundation. On the other hand, you're encouraged to use your imagination to envision your future. Too much concentration on the mundane might arbitrarily limit your potential. But your dreams don't have a chance if you over-indulge your fantasies. Dancing on the edge is easier if you keep one foot in each world."
aquarius,2015-02-18,"You have a unique opportunity to reset your emotional calendar today when the Aquarius New Moon lands in your 1st House of Self. It's nearly impossible to maintain objectivity because your passions are so strong now. Although there's no need to apologize for a minor meltdown, you might want to think twice before delivering any ultimatums. Don't make any major decisions yet; allow for the full spectrum of your feelings to express themselves before initiating any action."
pisces,2015-02-18,"There's magic in store for you if you're willing to swim through the swirling and healing waters of your own mind. The Aquarius New Moon floats in your 12th House of Spirituality, taking you on a magical mystery tour. Thankfully, you're fully prepared for this journey of imagination. Although you might encounter a bit of turbulence along the way, your current experiences will be of lasting significance."
aries,2015-02-19,"Your dreams inspire you to set lofty goals today, yet the strength of your convictions counteracts any discouragement that may surface if you don't accomplish everything you want. Although your thinking might be spiritually based now, you're able to remain pragmatic about executing your plans. Nevertheless, don't waste time wondering if you are extending your reach too far. Putting all the puzzle pieces in their proper places requires persistence and faith."
taurus,2015-02-19,"Although your unflappable determination will likely pull you through a bout of uncertainty, you may question your motives throughout the day. It's unlike you to blindly place faith in unrealistic visions, but it actually seems possible to reach for the distant galaxies today and pluck one right out of the sky. Unfortunately, you might not be as ready for prime time as you believe, since there's still quite a bit of work in front of you. Fortunately, you can rely on your legendary patience now that you need it more than ever."
gemini,2015-02-19,"Your day begins shrouded in dreams, and you can't help but wonder if they are worth pursuing. In fact, you may become more involved with deconstructing your fantasies in an attempt to make them real. At times, you might worry that you have lost your objectivity. Even if you receive a whoosh of cosmic energy that shouts yes from every direction, resist the whirlwind of impulsive action. The slower you move today, the more successful you will be in reaching your goals."
cancer,2015-02-19,"Stay connected with your inner world today, and the path in front of you should remain clear enough for your continued journey. It really doesn't matter if you run into any unexpected obstacles as long as you keep doing your best to overcome all odds. But don't try to convince yourself that you know what will happen next. Your fate is swinging like a pendulum now; maintaining singular focus on your destination is the most reliable strategy in your playbook."
leo,2015-02-19,"You seem to be an enigma today, especially if you decide to keep your emotions under wraps. Although you might be too thin-skinned for your own comfort now, you feel more secure if your friends and co-workers don't even know enough details to ask you probing questions. Ironically, someone's well-intended support could annoy you just as much as the resistance you face. Thankfully, your troubles begin to fade when you are confident enough to expose your vulnerabilities to a trustworthy companion who can give you a fresh perspective."
virgo,2015-02-19,"You are the source of inspiration for your friends and associates today. If you're participating in a collaborative effort, members of your team look to you for guidance because they trust your judgment. But this isn't a valid excuse to act like you're in charge. Simply respond honestly when asked for your opinion. Paradoxically, your logical and understated approach may be exactly what's needed to instill confidence in others. Trust your instincts to reveal the next steps on the road to success."
libra,2015-02-19,"Sharing your dreams with a close friend or coworker enables you to maintain your emotional equilibrium today. But this isn't an invitation to drift off into fantasies. It's an opportunity to express your concrete vision of an idealistic future that's realistic enough to be possible. However, you may grow impatient with your feelings later in the day, making them harder to express. Don't wait too long; talking about a previously hidden secret could be the necessary catalyst to get the  conversation rolling in the right direction."
scorpio,2015-02-19,"Your natural sense of timing gives you the ability to efficiently organize a complicate project. If your intentions are altruistic, you could even convince others to join your cause. Your uncanny ability to play Tom Sawyer and re-frame an unpleasant situation allows you to make a job sound like fun while still adhering to the truth. Make sure to describe exactly what you see because your current perspective can help people visualize possibilities they might miss without your intervention. Luckily, your positive attitude is contagious, so pass it on."
sagittarius,2015-02-19,"You might appear to be disconnected from reality today, but nothing could be further from the truth. You seem spacey to others at first, but once they stop to listen, your ideas begin to make sense to them. Using your imagination enables you to reach into the future, yet your ability to support your observations with rational thinking takes your vision to a whole new level now. There's nothing wrong with going out on a limb as long as you fill everyone in on how you reached your conclusions."
capricorn,2015-02-19,"Your message is clear and your communication skills are evident, empowering you to hold your audience's undivided attention as you talk about the future. However, you are also in touch with your spiritual core now, so you're not limited to a logical perspective. There's no reason to cling to previous plans while circumstances continue to evolve. Letting go of an old agenda frees up room for a more meaningful one that reflects your current state of mind. The times are changing and you must change with them."
aquarius,2015-02-19,"Although you are adept at moving in two worlds today as you dance between reality and fantasy, you become increasingly uncomfortable with escaping into dreams as the day wears on. Luckily, the currents pulling you back into the rational world are strong ones and there's no need to resist the flow. Starting a new project, job or relationship leads to success as long you don't waste energy looking in the rear-view mirror. Capture this auspicious energy by remaining fully engaged in the present moment."
pisces,2015-02-19,"Interpersonal dynamics are shifting and recent pressures may be lifting now; it feels as if you can finally breathe easily again. One reason for this mood change is your enthusiasm about all the intriguing possibilities everywhere you look. Happily, you believe your goals are within reach. Nevertheless, you can also sense an approaching disturbance in your surrounding energy field. Although you can't yet recognize its source, this looming disharmony bothers you. Trusting your sixth sense is wise now, but don't let your fear of the unknown overpower the potential of the future."
aries,2015-02-20,"No one has a clue about what you might do next because you are ready to reclaim control of your life. Even if your recent visits to the fantasy realms were lovely, it's now time to push your dreams out into the real world. Fortunately, your key planet Mars is back in your sign for the next six weeks, empowering you to draw upon your famous Aries courage to overcome your fears. Just don't expect too much all at once, since it could be another month before your new plans actually begin to take shape. Make the most of this auspicious time and reach for the stars."
taurus,2015-02-20,"You're already shifting gears into a phase where your dreams become just as important as reality. Wandering around in your imagination can be a creative process today, but there may be complications with indulging in too much fantasy. Your beliefs could limit your success if you unwittingly cling to unconscious patterns. Look deeply within and banish any fears that are preventing you from manifesting your destiny."
gemini,2015-02-20,"Tighten your grip on reality today because you're about to receive a jolt of energy in the form of several planets blasting into your 11th House of Friends. You might be resistant to organized social activities at first, but if you let your guard down you could have so much fun that you end up exhausted. The trick is to balance your personal needs with the demands of your companions and associates. You can have fun making wonderful connections this month if you don't take your revelry too far."
cancer,2015-02-20,"Putting your plans into action today is a sensible move if you're thinking about your career trajectory. Fortunately, you have plenty of stamina to apply to your job over the weeks ahead, but you still need to be careful managing your time. You may inadvertently threaten someone -- even your boss -- if you appear too ambitious. Unfortunately, you might waste precious energy resolving conflicts that could have easily been avoided with clear communication. No one can fault you if you simply clarify your goals and start working to meet your objectives."
leo,2015-02-20,"You have a renewed sense of enthusiasm and are eager to plan your future, to travel or to begin an entirely new course of study -- anything that expands your horizons. Action-hero Mars enters a fellow fire sign today, prompting you to take a risk to make the most of this cosmic chemistry. However, you may discover you're defending indefensible positions if you overly identify with your beliefs. It's better to quietly lead by example than to try to convince anyone that your views are the only ones that matter. Pick one practical goal and don't let anything get in your way."
virgo,2015-02-20,"The need to redefine relationships may start to subside now, but new experiences reawaken old issues, even if they are less dramatic. You are motivated to push ahead with your own agenda, yet you're reluctant to offend anyone close to you. Inevitably, your conflicted feelings muddy the waters and make solutions more difficult to find. One thing is for sure: you must rely on other people to reach your destination. The temptation to head off alone only complicates matters more. Nevertheless, the choice is still yours to make. Following your heart is the most authentic path."
libra,2015-02-20,"You are driven to initiate decisive action now -- something that's often a struggle for you. You're more assertive in all types of relationships with warrior Mars and sexy Venus creating sparks in your 7th House of Partners. Don't wait until someone else takes charge; step up to the plate and aim for the fence. As long as you act within a context of cooperation, things will work out for the best for everyone involved."
scorpio,2015-02-20,"A combative atmosphere may reveal a difference of opinions at work today. External circumstances require you to perform at a high level of competence while doing your job. But you want to do some things your own way, only to find your path is blocked for one reason or another. Don't internalize your frustration because you will only stir up more stress if you do. The most obvious solution is to act with integrity and take pride in your work, regardless of everything else."
sagittarius,2015-02-20,"You have no patience with anyone who tries to prevent you from having your share of fun today. But pleasure is not your true goal; your real enjoyment comes from expressing what's in your heart. Fortunately, there's not much that can impede your creativity as playful Venus and Mars skip into your 5th House of Spontaneity. There's no reason to do anything halfway now so don't hold back. This is your chance to show the world what you have to offer. Shine, baby, shine."
capricorn,2015-02-20,"You may not be able to control all the changes in your personal life, yet you're secretly excited about your future prospects. There is a lot to do around the home now and, thankfully, you have the drive to start projects and the energy to complete them. Maintain a low profile today; it's difficult to downplay your emotions, but your discretion is worth it. At least, you can avoid some of the drama that otherwise might arise due to differences of feelings. Staying out of the limelight enables you to accomplish more than you expect."
aquarius,2015-02-20,"Close friends raise the noise level of your daily routine. But you're quite expressive yourself, and your eagerness to converse might unintentionally initiate more conflict than you want. You tend to over-personalize other people's actions today, so don't engage in pointless arguments. An emotional showdown is a complete waste of everyone's energies and won't make anyone happier, no matter who wins the fight. Don't overstate your case; instead, channel your  your passion into your work."
pisces,2015-02-20,"Be cautious about making an impulsive decision today, especially one that relates to how you spend your money. You're inclined to purchase something you don't really need, or you might buy it for the wrong reasons. Unfortunately, problems arise if you over-identify with material possessions. Your current lesson -- even if it's a repeat -- is that happiness comes from within and not from what you own. Take stock of all the blessings in your life, and you may discover you already have everything you need."
aries,2015-02-21,"You might have grown accustomed to repetitive waves of energy that continue to surge through your life these days. But the Moon's current visit to your sign is another reminder of the big changes that are unfolding right before your eyes. You are quite excitable and easily overwhelmed by your emotions today. Opening your heart to a close friend could make you feel uncomfortable at first, but it has the potential to deepen your relationship. As Jim Morrison sang, ""The time to hesitate is through."""
taurus,2015-02-21,"Social commitments pile up on your calendar, making you realize that you don't have much time to spare. You might need to clarify your boundaries by emphatically saying no if you have spread yourself too thin. However, hiding in your cave isn't the wisest course to take just because you have too much on your plate. Nevertheless, avoiding unproductive distractions makes sense today, even if you're feeling restless. Focus on your immediate chores and you will work your way through this tricky territory sooner than you expect."
gemini,2015-02-21,"You want others to think you are happily embracing the future as you smile your way through the day. You might pretend that all is well now, but you're probably afraid of being misunderstood if you tell others how you really feel. Although you're usually adept at steering clear of unnecessary melodrama, your impulsive actions may inadvertently stir up an uncomfortable level of intensity today. Being totally honest about your fears is the first step to healing your lingering insecurities. Your authenticity earns you admiration from your friends."
cancer,2015-02-21,"Although you recently were comfortable swimming in emotional waters, it seems as if you're being hauled up onto dry land now. It's time to act on your feelings instead of just passively experiencing them. Unfortunately, memories of a previous rejection arise when you swing into motion, You may consider pulling back in your shell, but it's healthier to take a few deep breaths and honor your past before pushing through the resistance. No matter what happens next, taking a chance and revealing what you want is your best bet for fulfilling your dreams."
leo,2015-02-21,"You are handed a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card today, and your confidence soars as you imagine all the possibilities ahead. There's little that can hold you back as the fiery Aries Moon joins rebellious Uranus in your extroverted 9th House of Big Ideas. You have more than enough momentum to make new plans for the future, even if you haven't fully processed what is occurring in the present moment. Thankfully, you don't have to figure it all out yet; methodically reassess your options and let time work its own magic."
virgo,2015-02-21,"You might be frustrated with your own fluctuating moods today. You're itching for new experiences even if you're constrained by promises you made in a relationship. Nevertheless, something unexpected reawakens buried desires and inspires you with the excitement of living in the moment. Paradoxically, you can't just forget about your previous commitments, leaving you conflicted about how to spend your time. Although you may surprise others with your joie de vivre, you deserve a chance to pursue pleasure just as much as anyone else."
libra,2015-02-21,"The line between commitment and codependency is hard to define today because it's your natural inclination to make other people happy. But the Moon's presence in your 7th House of Relationships is a stark reminder of how difficult it is to be true to yourself when someone else is an integral part of your life. Although fulfilling your own needs could create stress, taking care of yourself also makes you a better partner in the long run. You can't love anyone fully until you love yourself."
scorpio,2015-02-21,"You are exploring new territory close to an unfamiliar emotional edge today, but it might be smart to keep your feelings to yourself. Your patience has run out and you are nearly ready to do something that you'll probably regret. Thankfully, it's totally your choice; you don't have to do it. There may be too much at stake to tempt fate with unnecessary risks now, so try working off your anxiety through physical exercise instead. Channel your nervous tension into something positive and you won't have anything to apologize for later."
sagittarius,2015-02-21,"You're feeling lucky enough to win the lottery today, which could tempt you to gamble more than is prudent. Maintaining a positive attitude is always a wise strategy, but your unflagging optimism might be too much of a good thing now. Risk-taking won't automatically lead to loss, but taking a tried and true path improves your chances for success even more. Don't be greedy and overextend your resources; establish realistic goals and then be diligent in your effort to reach them. Less is more."
capricorn,2015-02-21,"You can see the distant horizon now and your ambitions propel you toward your destination. However, your foundation may be weak if you don't trust your own perceptions. You might be so self-critical that you doubt your ability to sustain productivity when you move into unfamiliar territory. You could exhaust yourself by trying to prove your invincibility. Ironically, slowing down today can actually help you achieve success quicker than you expect. Believing in your tenacity makes the journey one of personal growth."
aquarius,2015-02-21,"You may spend your day running around in circles, distracted by one thing after another. Anything that's new and different reminds you that breaking free from routine is always an option. But you don't need to wait for additional reasons to make your move. Exercise your right to be as creative as you please. Just remember that your current decisions aren't necessarily about life-changing matters. Consider how best to express your unique sense of style in every moment and make your choices accordingly."
pisces,2015-02-21,"You might be having trouble completely letting go of your past and fully immersing yourself in the next phase of your journey. However, it's crucial to accept the feedback you receive from the universe at this time. There's no reason to allow discouragement to overtake the promise of the future; the current challenges are meant to help propel you toward your goals rather than stopping your progress. If everything is coming up roses, don't go looking for the thorns."
aries,2015-02-22,"You are anxious to make your move today because you believe you will lose your opportunity if you don't act right away. However, you could overextend your resources if you don't stop to think first. Even if you are quite sure of yourself, this isn't a smart time to test your limits with Saturn in the picture. Start slowly for a change; accruing experience is more reliable in the long run than acting on false confidence. Wisdom wins over inspiration."
taurus,2015-02-22,"You tend to see your world through a spiritual lens today, empowering you to reassess a problem with a healthier perspective. Although it's likely the circumstances haven't changed, a new and improved attitude makes a huge difference. You may be tempted to share your new outlook with everyone you meet, but too much talking could dissipate your energy. Instead, maximize your current potential by channeling your highest intentions into constructive action."
gemini,2015-02-22,"Although you may have been in a rut for a while, you're finally making progress on a personal issue. You're ready to take a gamble with your heart, but revealing a longstanding problem can be scary because you don't know how others will react. Nevertheless, your impatience serves an important function, prompting you to bring someone into your confidence. If you allow the current opportunity to pass, you could be left with regret tomorrow about what you didn't say today. Act now while you have the planets cheering you on."
cancer,2015-02-22,"You may experience a sense of relief today because you are eager to move beyond an old pattern of keeping your feelings quiet. Your world seems to be more supportive of your emotions now, giving you the chance to shift the dynamics of a significant relationship. Unfortunately, your current optimism won't last unless you take immediate action to show that your intentions are honorable. Thankfully, a carefully calculated risk could bring the positive change you seek."
leo,2015-02-22,"Your future seems brighter today since the resistance you were previously facing has faded away. You can't contain your impatience; if something exciting isn't already happening, you are eager to fuel the fire with your optimistic energy. It's crucial to seize the day because your enthusiasm might not last once stern Saturn makes its presence felt tomorrow. You have the potential to help others enjoy themselves while you express your own joy."
virgo,2015-02-22,"Although your motivation to succeed hasn't disappeared, you're not as worried now because your goals are actually within reach. You aren't home free yet, but you might be able to slow down today and catch your breath. Enjoying a bit of time off can be rejuvenating, but don't let too many hours slip away. You may have another hoop to jump through before you achieve satisfaction. Wiling away your day in dreamland won't help you get your work done any faster. Take a well-deserved break but don't forget your mission."
libra,2015-02-22,"Others may inspire you with their creative flair and sense of beauty while artistic Venus hooks up with energetic Mars in your 7th House of Companions. Perhaps a friend or partner becomes overly enthusiastic about a project, encouraging you to become more involved. Although everything outside of your original plans might seem like a distraction, this is not the full story today. Stay flexible enough to head off in an entirely new direction; anything you start now gains greater significance in the weeks ahead."
scorpio,2015-02-22,"Throw away the recipes and forget the rules; follow your gut instincts today when it comes to doing a task in an entirely new way. You are less restrained by old habits now, empowering you to analyze your work methods in a different light while you have the time. Your plan might not produce tangible results right away, but you won't know what is possible until you give it a try. Even if you're not immediately successful, don't give up; hitting your mark may require multiple attempts before you get it just right."
sagittarius,2015-02-22,"It seems as if nothing will hold you back today because you can see the sunny side of every street. However, you may be so enthusiastic that you forget to consider the consequences of your actions. Luckily, the creative Venus-Mars conjunction lands in your 5th House of Spontaneity, minimizing your chances of making a bad decision. Nevertheless, Saturn's proximity requires you to analyze all your options before committing to one path. Proper planning increases the likelihood of success so put your ducks in order and aim for the stars."
capricorn,2015-02-22,"You need to attend to a domestic matter today, even if you are yearning to get out and do something different. Nevertheless, this could be an excellent time to take care of personal business, whether you have to do some chores around the house, manage your finances or resolve a family squabble. Just don't turn a minor matter into a major concern. If you are working on a big project, give it an extra boost of energy now. Nearly anything you do today carries extra weight, propelling your actions even further into the future."
aquarius,2015-02-22,"You may be so busy with a wide variety of chores today that you don't even have time to think about anything else. Ironically, the hectic pace might be enjoyable because it keeps your mind fully occupied and your thoughts off your troubles. Don't hold back; jump in and give everything you do one hundred and ten percent of your attention. But don't forget to take some time to rest later in the day so you're ready to meet your responsibilities tomorrow. Life is a marathon, not a sprint."
pisces,2015-02-22,"Your current strategy might not be the absolute best one now, but you are more than likely to succeed anyhow if your actions are in harmony with your core values. You may even believe your attitude is more important than hard work. Unfortunately, this kind of blind optimism isn't healthy if it encourages poor choices. Reaching for a distant star is a great idea as long as your plan is sound and you have sufficient fuel to get to your destination."
aries,2015-02-23,"Your career goals are on your mind today as you process your fears that previously held you back. No matter how much resistance arises from your subconscious, facing your shortcomings is inescapable now. You might try to keep the big picture in mind as you attempt to avoid the details. Unfortunately, you can't just sweep uncomfortable feelings into the past before you acknowledge the truth. The sooner you commit to completely clearing the air, the quicker you can get on with the next stage of your journey. Out with the old, in with the new."
taurus,2015-02-23,"You may believe you finally discovered a workable mix of practicality and creativity, but you're secretly afraid it won't last. Although your dreams contain messages about your future, you're not sure you can trust them. You want hard, cold facts, not inspirational visions. Nevertheless, your intuition is a reliable guide now if only you have more faith in the process. Sink slowly into your imagination while you have the chance, for your momentum in the real world will continue to build over the days ahead."
gemini,2015-02-23,"You can feel the tension between your professional aspirations and the hopeful expectations of others. You are fully capable of making big decisions now that responsible Saturn is squaring the Sun in your 10th House of Career, but it seems as if there isn't a sensible way to reach your goals. Don't panic, even if your self-doubt lingers; instead, recognize this delay as a temporary setback. You are being called upon to show a higher level of excellence. The resistance will fade when your preparation is sufficient, allowing you to make new progress."
cancer,2015-02-23,"Your efforts could pay off as they reach critical mass today, especially if you have been putting in long hours on a big project. Unfortunately, you may have to make a choice now, knowing that none of the current options will bring you exactly what you want. But this crossroads is not about taking the easy way out. Rather, it's the realization that a single choice can't completely fix the complex circumstances of your life. Don't make decisions based on your fear of failure. Be courageous and act on your hopes for a brighter future, instead."
leo,2015-02-23,"The joy in your heart may be dampened by somber Saturn's heavy square to the radiant Sun today. You can feel the weight of your own limitations while the storm clouds are raining on your 5th House of Fun and Games. Rather than faking happiness now, apply your mental capabilities to analyze the reasons you cannot easily get to where you wish to go. If you rethink your strategy, things will lighten up sooner than you expect. Rise to the challenge and use this as an opportunity to shine."
virgo,2015-02-23,"Your nervous system continues to receive numerous messages that are coming in on many open channels. Unfortunately, you may be simultaneously overloaded with work and overwhelmed with family challenges, making it nearly impossible to separate out the relevant data from the noise. Don't give up in frustration. Instead, lean gently into the pressure until it gradually releases over the next few days. Persistence is your friend."
libra,2015-02-23,"Your schedule is overloaded with one too many commitments, leaving you rather frazzled and frustrated. Although friends and coworkers may appear to be standing in your way now, it won't be productive if you unleash your pent-up stress at them. But if you bury your anger, you may just end up hotter under the collar. Keep your emotional energy moving by staying busy with your work. If you concentrate your efforts you'll accomplish more than you ever imagined possible. Your positive attitude is key to your success."
scorpio,2015-02-23,"Warm and fuzzy feelings quickly evaporate as you encounter the cool rejection of a partner or coworker who is unwilling to accommodate your needs. Instead of expressing your disappointment with someone else's behavior, find your own creative voice and sing your own song. Clarify your core values by reevaluating what is most important to you without focusing on anyone else's shortcomings. Be true to your convictions and create a routine that's centered on actualizing your dreams."
sagittarius,2015-02-23,"You're walking on an emotional edge today, agitated by little things that normally wouldn't upset you. Although this internal stress won't last long, knowing that it's a short-term influence still might not help you feel better in the immediate moment. Nevertheless, it's crucial to practice self-restraint while the Sun is squaring stern Saturn in your sign. Staring longingly toward the distant horizon doesn't get you anywhere now. However, patiently taking one step at a time enables you to go as far as you can imagine."
capricorn,2015-02-23,"An authority figure could be cramping your creative style today. Even if you think you have all the answers, someone might put you in your place by belittling your ideas. Or, perhaps, other people are having trouble with your attempts to control them through indirect channels. Either way, you are bumping up against the walls of constraint as you try to express yourself in a simple and straightforward manner. Fortunately, reality is not an all-or-nothing proposition. Even if you aren't happy about it, tempering your urge to do things your way now can help you attain your goals in the long run."
aquarius,2015-02-23,"You may feel pressure from your friends or coworkers, especially if they are expecting more from you than you are willing to give. The more you think about their demands, the angrier you become today. However, there's no direct way to vent your feelings without creating more trouble than it's worth. Paradoxically, your current stress is a vicious circle and practicing patience helps you regain a calmer state of mind. You don't have to fix anything now; a workable solution will magically appear once you stop struggling over things that don't matter."
pisces,2015-02-23,"Although you might be carrying a heavy load of responsibilities on the job, you are currently well-equipped to handle the extra work. Unfortunately, you will likely fail if you try to do everything all at once. Tackling one small chore at a time is the best way to work with the energy of Saturn. Before you know it, you will have made more progress than you ever thought possible. This isn't about flashy demonstrations of brilliance today; it's about steady effort that will pay off in time. Imagining your success inspires you to soar to great heights."
aries,2015-02-24,"Taking a setback in stride today casts you in a favorable light. However, you have a better chance of succeeding if you stop long enough to listen to the messages you're receiving from your peers. The resistance is probably occurring for good reason, even if you choose to avoid it. Thankfully, the obstacles could become manageable once you understand why they are appearing in your path. Remember, it's less crucial now to reach your destination than to integrate the current lessons. Everyone is a teacher when you're ready to learn."
taurus,2015-02-24,"You could feel complacent with your current trajectory in life, making it more difficult to shift into gear, even if you have a lot to accomplish today. Thankfully, you can sustain your efforts with ease once you finally get moving. But once you find a workable pace, you won't want to slow down no matter what stands in your way. Overreacting doesn't enable you to make faster progress, so remain open to another point of view to widen your perspective. More awareness means more options."
gemini,2015-02-24,"Conserving your energy is a good idea today; practicing moderation prevents you from wasting valuable resources. However, it isn't wise to think of this as a retreat; instead, you need some quality downtime to solidify your recent gains. Remember, you could jeopardize your work if you react impulsively without considering the consequences. Luckily, you can make significant progress if you concentrate on your long-term goals and believe in your future success."
cancer,2015-02-24,"You want to keep your feelings private today, but someone's erratic behavior is likely to push your buttons and prompt you to respond. Even if you try to let the annoyance pass, your thoughts seem to have a life of their own. Just remember that when you do finally choose to express yourself, speak your truth as clearly as you can. Taking full responsibility for your words helps to avert an unnecessary argument. No one can find fault in what you say if you come from a place of love."
leo,2015-02-24,A close friend or partner might seem emotionally distant today if he or she acts without taking your feelings into consideration. But you may jump to an incorrect conclusion because you don't have all the pertinent information at your disposal. Don't react too quickly; listen closely to what others have to say now or you could miss your chance to improve your game. Deliberating on your long-term plans could save you from experiencing short-time grief. Haste makes waste.
virgo,2015-02-24,"You're not as isolated from others as you think, even if you are singing the blues today. Thankfully, your truest friends come through with the support you need. However, they still may not be as warm and nurturing as you wish. Nevertheless, your loved ones show up for you if you don't push them away with your false assumptions about how they should react. If you are feeling insecure, give others the benefit of the doubt. They may warm up if you don't give them the cold shoulder first."
libra,2015-02-24,"You may think that someone isn't being very responsible today and it falls on your shoulders to pick up the slack. You could quickly grow to resent a friend or co-worker who pressures you to make a decision on a subject you're not yet ready to address. You're not interested in cooperating with those who appear to have their own agendas. Nevertheless, it's healthier to observe your discomfort now and express your dissatisfaction another day once your emotions have settled down. Good things come to those who wait."
scorpio,2015-02-24,"You have significant goals that grow more refined day by day, but you're not willing to discuss them with anyone else. A positive outlook on your future is a blessing, yet your feelings may be so intense that you could overwhelm someone when you stand up for your beliefs. Fortunately, you are able to avoid a needless argument if you simply remember to tread softly and carry a compassionate stick. It's not necessary to get bent out of shape over something that ultimately isn't that important. In the meantime, channel your emotional passion into your work."
sagittarius,2015-02-24,"Don't dismiss someone's concerns too quickly, because it's less critical to you than it is to the person who confides in you. You might lose out on an opportunity to move a relationship into new realms of intimacy if you're unwilling to participate in a heartfelt discussion. However, total resolution isn't necessary yet. Find a way to be supportive without getting swept up in a false sense of urgency. There really isn't a rush as long as you are sincerely engaging in the process."
capricorn,2015-02-24,"There's more going on than meets the eye today, judging from a difficult interaction with a friend or coworker. Even if you can tell that a power issue is lurking just around the corner, you don't know how to work with the apparent imbalance. You could create more problems than you solve by confronting the resistance. However, you will only contribute to the awkward energy if you just let your feelings slide. Although the conversation may be uncomfortable at first, it's still better to talk about your uneasiness before it gets worse. Honesty is the best policy."
aquarius,2015-02-24,"Whatever feelings you might try to hide today, the current situation is actually your own doing. Harboring resentment about someone at work could provoke you to lose your temper if you don't say what's on your mind. Thankfully, you may receive more support than you expect. Don't isolate yourself from others now; lean on your family and friends to help you process your emotions so you can get on with manifesting your dreams."
pisces,2015-02-24,"You are learning to find your emotional footing on ground that isn't as stable as it once was. Nevertheless, your spiritual foundation is stronger than ever, inspiring you to express your newly discovered confidence. However, your bravado may set up a competitive dynamic now if others are threatened by your apparent success. Keep your optimism to yourself today; softening your stance to the world can gently relieve tensions before they reach a point of no return. Moderation helps you create your own destiny."
aries,2015-02-25,You can make child's play out of the most complicated projects today. You're wired to navigate multiple paths that simultaneously converge on your desired destination. Reliable Saturn's smooth connection to your key planet Mars empowers you with the authority you need to make things happen. Just be careful because you may be so clever that you end up confusing an issue that was already resolved. Trust your intuition but bring your ideas back down to a practical level. You can't go wrong as long as you keep your feet on the ground.
taurus,2015-02-25,"Although you are quite appreciative of your friends and associates today, you also might be too idealistic about your relationships in general. Avoid floating off into fantasy realms, even if you're tempted to take things to a spiritual place. Make all decisions based on hard, cold facts now, rather than on your hopes and dreams. Thinking too much about the future distracts you from the present. Save your precious time and energy for the real work at hand so you can be proud of yourself at the end of the day."
gemini,2015-02-25,"Those you work with may claim to be watching out for your best interests now, but this might not actually be the case. Things aren't necessarily what they seem to be with the Sun hanging out with illusory Neptune in your 10th House of Career. Nevertheless, you are fully capable of cutting through the fog and navigating your way to success anyhow. The versatile Gemini Moon enables you to quickly adapt to new information as soon as it arrives. Don't depend on other people's empty promises; trust their actions and not their words."
cancer,2015-02-25,"Your idealism grows throughout the day, but taking any concept too far could bring a swift and sobering response. You may have a fairly rigid idea about how everything should run in your life, and believe that sticking to your plan is a smart strategy. However, being flexible at the right time about your goals can help smooth out the rough spots today. Ultimately, your uncharacteristic objectivity offers the best chance of achieving success."
leo,2015-02-25,"You're eager to get to the bottom of a mystery involving complex feelings about a business partner or close friend. Thankfully, your dogged determination will likely lead you in the right direction today. However, you might reach a point where the amount of effort required to find answers just isn't worth it. You can prevent facing disillusionment by knowing when to back off. In order to keep the magic alive, some things in our lives are better left unknown."
virgo,2015-02-25,"You want all your friends to feel comfortable today while you put your personal needs on the back burner. Paradoxically, there may be a selfish motivation to your seemingly altruistic actions now that the boundless Sun-Neptune conjunction lands in your 7th House of Others. If those around you are enjoying themselves, the odds for you being happy are greater, too. Fortunately, you are in top form, able to accomplish nearly anything you set your mind to now. Don't hold back; make this a memorable day however you can."
libra,2015-02-25,"You might have unrealistic expectations about how much you can accomplish today, but a little advanced planning goes a long way. Compensate for your dreamy state of mind by putting extra structure in your schedule. Making commitments that involve friends or coworkers now helps you stay on track since taskmaster Saturn harmonizes with energetic Mars in your 7th House of Others. Knowing when to depend on someone else could make the difference between failure and success."
scorpio,2015-02-25,"Your creativity knows no bounds today, yet, paradoxically, you can work comfortably within nearly any situation. Although the surreal Sun-Neptune conjunction falls in your 5th House of Self-Expression, practical Saturn is lending you support just when you need it most, preventing you from getting lost in your dreams. There's no need to worry about taking an idea too far; every time you step dangerously close to an edge, reality will gently nudge you back to safety. All you need to do is pay attention to the signs."
sagittarius,2015-02-25,"Setting realistic goals is naturally wise, but you can outperform all of your expectations now as self-directed Mars trines hardworking Saturn in your 1st House of Self. You have the ability to turn a creative idea into reality today because your mind is capable of organizing a project into distinct tasks. However, you must stay aware of your feelings or self-doubt could creep into the mix and impede your progress. Acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses before moving on. You current success depends on striking a healthy balance between indulging the uncertainty and cultivating your positive attitude."
capricorn,2015-02-25,"You can make a wish and have it come true today because you're cleverly working in two worlds at the same time. Although your mind is actively pursuing fantasies now, this process is not about distracting you from your work. Instead, it's your way of exploring the possibilities ahead of you. Thankfully, super-hero Mars is busy collaborating with your key planet Saturn, empowering you to focus on the most practical aspects of your daydreams. Your imagination is revealing important clues about what's around the next bend; all you need to do is take the time to listen."
aquarius,2015-02-25,"Accepting a social invitation or connecting with a friend could be more important to your professional progress than you think at first. Although you might not be clear about your own priorities today, interacting with your peers brings clarity to your goals. Don't be afraid to share your beliefs; but make sure to be open to the feedback you receive. The practical advice that comes your way now is like a lighthouse beacon in a storm that you can use to set your bearings."
pisces,2015-02-25,"A variety of little things seem to be playing out in your favor now that the Sun is aligning with otherworldly Neptune in your sensitive sign. Normally, this conjunction might trigger warning alarms because you could easily fool yourself, believing that your fantasies are real. However, you're also receiving a cosmic reality check today from serious Saturn, reminding you that a dreamy illusion is not a substitute for logic and common sense. Fortunately, a bit of humility and a lot of hard work can make your wildest dreams come true."
aries,2015-02-26,"You might not be ready to let go your attachment to the anticipation of an upcoming experience. Nevertheless, you still long for a more easygoing day. You may be oblivious to the irony of being attracted to the adrenaline rush of the unknown while simultaneously wishing you could take a more laid-back approach to life. Entertaining your fantasies is one thing; how you live your life is something else. Thankfully, you can do both."
taurus,2015-02-26,"You think your day is well planned, but you can't foretell how it will actually unfold. It's tempting to believe that everything will go your way, but it's challenging to adhere to a predetermined schedule when your priorities are in flux. Fortunately, the pressure to be productive should ease throughout the day. You don't need to have the final answer now. Quickly adapting to unexpected changes gives you the best chance of coming out on top."
gemini,2015-02-26,"You may be convinced that this is the right time to reinvent yourself because you can imagine so many alternatives. Even if your creativity is running strong today, you could possess more self-confidence than clarity. Instead of making concrete plans, give yourself permission to dream. The whimsical Gemini Moon reminds you that you don't have to be practical at this time; you can always turn your fantasies into action on another day. For now, simply follow your thoughts wherever they take you and enjoy the ride."
cancer,2015-02-26,"Your irrepressible desire to go on an adventure may become slightly obsessive today. However, you might feel your fantasy vacation begin to slip away before you can actually manifest your dreams. Everyone seems critical of your ideas because they think you're being too idealistic, but their judgments of your impracticality aren't in your best interest now. Keep your hopes alive and stick to your belief they will come true. Just don't exhaust yourself by trying too hard to make it all happen right away. The universe has an uncanny sense of timing."
leo,2015-02-26,"The emotional landscape of your life is undergoing metamorphosis, no matter much you attempt to hold onto the status quo. But a business partnership or a romance may grow less practical over the days ahead. Thankfully, there's still an excellent chance of a successful collaboration, but it's not be wise to assert yourself too strongly now. Curb your impatience; instead of trying to force an issue, keep your dreams alive for the time being by imagining your relationships just the way you want them to be."
virgo,2015-02-26,"Seeing your partner or coworker in a rational light is nearly impossible now because your illusions are spilling over, onto others as the radiant Sun joins confusing Neptune in your 7th House of Relationships. Your intentions carry a strong emotional charge that arises from deep within your subconscious mind; you might not even realize what's going on behind the scenes today. But paying close attention to your feelings empowers you with a fresh perspective as long as you don't project your desires on to anyone else."
libra,2015-02-26,"Complaining about your plight at work won't help your cause today. However, the Sun is joining surreal Neptune in your 6th House of Work, fogging the details and obscuring your path. Instead of attempting to focus on your responsibilities, surrender to the flow and share your vision of what you could do once you finally finish your chores. However, talking about your plans isn't enough, so roll up your sleeves now and get busy right away. The sooner you start, the sooner you can move on."
scorpio,2015-02-26,"Sharing romantic fantasies with someone you love isn't all that simple now because there is much more drama than appears on the surface. Fortunately, the idealistic Sun-Neptune conjunction occurs in your 5th House of Love and Creativity, indicating pleasurable times ahead. Nevertheless, caution is advised because you're more persuasive than ever. Don't be greedy; asking for more than you need only complicates your life. The current key to happiness is having realistic expectations and an open heart."
sagittarius,2015-02-26,"You might get away with skipping the minor details today and heading right for the finish line without any additional planning. Although you may be quick to grasp the general concepts, you will not have much interest in all the little things that have to be in order for your dreams to be realized. Instead of trying to micromanage anything, allow your mind to extend as far as it can. Take several deep breaths and let a few days pass before you return to the drawing board."
capricorn,2015-02-26,"You may be called upon to manage several small emergencies that crop up today. Fortunately, you can produce a lasting positive effect on your immediate environment while smoothing out the bumps in the road. Nevertheless, an unexpected event could open a whole new dimension to a current situation. Everything is more complicated than you think now. If you are missing some facts, be proactive and fill in the details with your imagination."
aquarius,2015-02-26,"Your innate intelligence comes in handy today because you can rely on logic if you're not sure of where you stand on a specific issue. However, your beautiful daydreams still could distract you, delaying the resolution of a complex problem. Don't run away in pursuit of your perfect fantasy; instead of starting a new project, work diligently to improve something you already started. There's no need to draw attention to your efforts; just make sure your actions are aligned with your values to achieve the best results."
pisces,2015-02-26,"Your perspective is bent out of shape today, with your dreams so close that you believe you can touch them. However, it's tricky business to bring your idealistic visions out of the clouds and all the way back down to earth. You may be spinning wheels in your mind and working overtime to analyze illogical scenarios. But your current preoccupation with turning your fantasies into reality isn't obvious to everyone else. Ironically, the complexity of your current situation will quickly resolve on its own once you stop the unnecessary struggling and go with the flow."
aries,2015-02-27,"Relationship issues are making you more impatient by the day, and you might not know which way to turn now. You really don't like feeling so vulnerable; in fact, you often prefer to be independent of the responsibilities that come along with a relationship. Nevertheless, you're still aware of the great potential for growth, even if you must confront your own discomfort along the way. Unfortunately, logic won't help you decide what to do today. Ultimately, your best strategy is to just follow your heart."
taurus,2015-02-27,"Your desire for emotional connection with others could conflict with your need for solitude today. This dichotomy can be frustrating and might provoke you to strike out at someone who is actually supportive of your goals. However, your inner process doesn't have to be the main focus of the day. Clarifying your personal and professional responsibilities enables you to respond in a more sensible manner. Thankfully, you can accept assistance while still maintaining your personal boundaries by simply being honest."
gemini,2015-02-27,"You could get a much-needed reprieve from the hectic pace of your life today. You might as well settle into the silence gracefully without stirring up new action because you won't likely make much progress now, even if you try. However, an unexpected emotional outburst on your part could trigger someone to overreact in turn. Avoid being sideswiped by your own unconscious feelings. Expressing your needs as they arise leaves no room for unnecessary drama and needless confusion."
cancer,2015-02-27,"Although you might realize that you're at the edge of a new emotional cycle, you're not yet ready to forge ahead. Thankfully, you will have a good shot at reaching your goals as long as you take whatever extra time you need. The Moon's return to your sensitive sign today will only make you more frustrated if you push too hard because you could inadvertently agitate a hornet's nest of unwarranted worries. Be patient; it's smarter to chill out now and try again once the energy settles down. Timing is everything."
leo,2015-02-27,"Your friends may tempt you to take a risk at work now, even if you know better. Other people's eloquence inspires you to act more spontaneously, but the power of the present moment isn't all that matters when you have your hopes pinned on the future. Ultimately, it's wise to remain silent today and tell everyone else about your innovative ideas on another day. In the meantime, stretch your imagination every way you can and explore all your options. Today's dreams could turn out to be the fuel for tomorrow's ambitions."
virgo,2015-02-27,"Standing back from your current obligations enables you to reevaluate your long-term goals, especially if you feel pressured to take a specific action today. Rather than being coerced into a bad decision, withdraw just enough to maintain your position. You recently learned an important lesson and now you can teach others how to achieve success. Integrate your feelings into your social interactions by sharing what's in your heart. Don't miss this opportunity to let down your guard and open up to someone you trust."
libra,2015-02-27,"You might face a stressful emotional dilemma as the cautious Cancer Moon creates anxious aspects with several planets today. Your unexpressed negativity intensifies if you try to make light of the current situation. Although your defenses are probably strong enough to keep others at bay now, you will still feel better if you let someone special into your heart instead of just trying to pretend you are okay on your own. People rely on you for support often enough; it's your turn to ask for help and lean on them."
scorpio,2015-02-27,"It may appear as if relief is on the way now, but there are no angels coming to your rescue just yet. Therefore, you are wise to take care of yourself as best as you can without waiting for reinforcements. Luckily, following your instincts will steer you in the right direction today if you don't waste too much energy worrying about something you can't control. Your friends will show up when you least expect it. In the meantime, take each event as it comes by responding from your gut and not your head."
sagittarius,2015-02-27,"You might have to acknowledge your disappointment today if you want a logical reason for everything that happens to you. Unfortunately, quick explanations aren't forthcoming now, turning up the intensity of your frustration. Luckily, you're not really worried about whatever you didn't receive; the real source of your discontent is about being coerced into saying more than you're prepared to reveal. Remember, you're not required to comment on your feelings until you're ready. Silence is golden."
capricorn,2015-02-27,"The flames of romance or of friendship may be rekindled today while the emotional Cancer Moon is hanging out in your 7th House of Relationships. The excitement could be especially intense if the feelings are shared with someone new. Nevertheless, you could grow annoyed if the other person withdraws just as you're ready to engage the enticing energy. Instead of overcompensating by demanding more attention, sit back and relax. Your sense of urgency isn't quite as pressing as it currently seems. Giving others the room they need improves your chances to deepen the connection over time."
aquarius,2015-02-27,"You have a lot on your plate now and wish you could avoid emotional distractions. However, you may not be able to make it through the entire day without encountering stressful relationship dynamics. Spontaneously jumping in to help someone handle their personal crisis might be unavoidable. Nevertheless, don't waste too much time on other people's dramas; redirect your energy and finish as many of your chores as possible. Focusing on the mundane keeps you occupied with constructive activities that show results right away."
pisces,2015-02-27,"No matter how many demands are being made on your time now, you are secretly planning your weekend to include plenty of relaxation. Unfortunately, your wishes may conflict with the current circumstances. However, no one can take away your fantasies if you keep them to yourself. Dreams are only constrained by reality if you attempt to manifest them. Using your imagination, fill in the details of your ideal escape. Although reality might not live up to your expectations, you could be pleasantly surprised if you focus on the potential and not the limitations."
aries,2015-02-28,"You might incorrectly assume that you have to solve everyone's problems today. Luckily, you can still be the strong and capable one while also being vulnerable enough to feel someone else's pain. However, you are not required to find a solution right away; neither must you avoid the dilemma. In fact, an alternative approach is to open your heart and experience the predicament without trying to fix it. The best move you can make is to listen closely and acknowledge another person's feelings. Just showing up for a loved one counts more than you realize."
taurus,2015-02-28,"A relative or friend might bug you so much today that you think he or she is trying to pick a fight with you. But don't let a non-issue grow so important that it leads to an unnecessary argument which becomes the focal point of your entire day. If you can successfully sidestep a confrontation now, you should be able to enjoy the fruits of your self-restraint later once they ripen. Remember, you are the master of your own destiny; taking the high road allows you to sleep well at night."
gemini,2015-02-28,"Balancing your unflagging need for mental stimulation with your current yearning to chill out can be tricky business. It's not that your interest to interact with others disappears; it's just that you don't want so many distractions when your sensitivity is on high alert. If you are feeling overextended in any part of your life now, take time to recharge your batteries so you are up for the challenges of next week. Even if everyone looks to you to set the social agenda, some quality time alone will do you good."
cancer,2015-02-28,"The raw power of your feelings could stop you in your tracks now that the evocative Moon is back in your contemplative sign. However, she also reminds you of how isolated you feel when you don't express your emotions. Unfortunately, it's difficult to communicate your experiences because you worry that your intensity may be too much for others to handle today. To prevent any unwanted drama, share on a need-to-know basis only. Luckily, staying in touch with your inner world is possible if you simply remain silent and offer a mysterious smile."
leo,2015-02-28,"It's tempting to hide your feelings today, especially if you're not as optimistic as everyone expects. The moody Cancer Moon is hanging out in your 12th House of Secrets, making it nearly impossible to reveal your uncertainty about the future. Paradoxically, sharing your vulnerability demonstrates your true strength. It takes extra courage to act on your gut instincts, especially if they appear out of step with the circumstances of your life. Being so transparent isn't as easy when your truth is hard to swallow, but honesty is still the best policy."
virgo,2015-02-28,"Being receptive and responsive to your friends and family may prove to be an enriching experience today, but you must first get over your fear of  rejection. Sharing your feelings can set you up for disappointment if others don't react as expected. Nevertheless, you'll never know what might develop if you don't take the risk. Opening your heart allows everyone to know your authentic self. Be willing to go to the edge without going over it."
libra,2015-02-28,"You may try to avoid the public eye today, yet you could be needed by others in a way that puts you front and center with everyone's attention on you. Oddly enough, it's not that you want to remain unseen; it's just that you feel awkward in the spotlight now. Whether you like it or not, it's time to choose between hiding out and stepping up to the plate. Finding balance is one of the recurring themes in your life; seek a comfortable place between being the star of the show and remaining a complete unknown."
scorpio,2015-02-28,"You can look off into the future and see your distant goals quite clearly now, but you still may be at a loss as how to best reach your destination. Unfortunately, you don't recognize any routes that lead directly to where you want to go. Fortunately, you are drawing on a very deep well of persistence and faith. Your willingness to wait for the right moment will clear the way for your success. Trust your intuition to lead you in the right direction."
sagittarius,2015-02-28,"Although it's always wise to deliver on your promises, you have other things on your agenda now as your creativity overflows with passion. You want to amaze others with your originality, but turning down the volume on your self-expression makes more sense than striking out on your own. You can still perform awesome feats, but sustaining your efforts throughout the day produces more positive impact in the long run than creating a flash of excitement by pulling a rabbit out of a hat and expecting everyone to applaud."
capricorn,2015-02-28,"You're confronted with an ambiguous message now, as others say one thing yet do another. You're encouraged by the loving support you receive, but it feels as if something still isn't quite right today. The unspoken judgment is that you're not doing enough, even if you have no idea of what else you could do. Don't let self-doubt creep into your life; focus on the positive feedback to propel you to the next level, instead. Ultimately, you can move mountains if you believe in yourself."
aquarius,2015-02-28,"You're extremely intuitive when it comes to what your close friends want today, enabling you to initiate helpful tasks before anyone even asks you for assistance. Unfortunately, you may also harbor resentment toward those who aren't willing to give you straightforward direction. You probably don't mind the extra work, but might feel frustrated about the lack of acknowledgement and appreciation. Instead of keeping your feelings quiet, talk to someone before your unhappiness gets the best of you. The more everyone knows now, the better the outcome."
pisces,2015-02-28,"You may feel more alive today, revitalized by the tidal Cancer Moon as she refreshes your pools of emotions. If you're attempting to recover from a recent schedule overload, set new boundaries while you still can. Thankfully, you won't have to relinquish any power, nor must you defend your personal right for taking a solitary path. Quietly basking in the delicious healing waters of your own compassion is sufficient for now. Creating inner peace ripples outward to others."
aries,2015-03-01,"Taking a few moments before you react to an emotional situation could prevent you from landing in a heap of trouble as you go about your activities today. Trying something new just because you're bored with your current circumstances isn't necessarily in your best interest. Your impulsive attraction to the unknown builds throughout the day, so it's best to remind yourself of what you have instead of coveting what you don't. Counting your blessings may be enough to elevate your perspective."
taurus,2015-03-01,"Your own optimism may be a bit disconcerting today; the uncertainty makes you nervous even if you're excited about the future. You prefer to sit back and indulge in some of your favorite pastimes, but are too restless to settle down. Your sense of instability might provoke you to rigidly cling to the status quo. However, resisting change can lead to dissatisfaction. As long as you are moving in the right direction, everything should turn out fine. More than ever, trusting the universe is the key to a happy life."
gemini,2015-03-01,"The logistics of stabilizing your finances may become more complex as the days go by, leaving you feeling somewhat rattled. The problem is that your satisfaction is dependent upon what you say now, rather than what you own. Let your fiscal responsibilities slide for a day or two if you can, while you shift your attention to the significant relationships in your life. Concentrating on the big picture today prevents you from becoming mired in unnecessary details while you develop a strategy that works to your advantage."
cancer,2015-03-01,"Communication issues are brought to the forefront today, especially if someone pushes you to do more than you can. You might feel as if this person is trying to manipulate you, but don't let yourself get pulled into emotional struggles that are not yours. Saying no may not seem natural, but your current unwillingness to over-commit can save both of you in the long run. Standing up for your position now is easier than attempting to do it later on. Speak up or forever hold your piece."
leo,2015-03-01,"A casual discussion may turn into an unnecessary argument today unless you make a conscious effort to be more flexible when defending your opinions. It takes real strength to walk away from a disagreement since your determination to stand up for the truth makes it difficult to justify keeping quiet. However, your life might be more enjoyable if you relax your pride. Show everyone your higher self by choosing to be amused by your moral self-righteousness instead of getting swept up in believing it."
virgo,2015-03-01,"As paradoxical as this sounds, you need to plan your spontaneity today. By scheduling time to be with your loved ones and letting them take the lead, you can be as frivolous as you wish without totally relinquishing control. Although your logical mind is still your best friend, there's no need to analyze how you could improve the events of the day. Shift the energy from your head to your heart; just go along with others and enjoy the ride."
libra,2015-03-01,"You have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish today, but your words might not accurately communicate your intentions. You can't help but make everything sound better than it is now, but convincing someone to join your cause could create more disruption to the routine than it's worth. Avoid being over-insistent, even if you are committed to your path. Slow down the pace and take it easy; accommodating the needs of others is more your style, anyhow."
scorpio,2015-03-01,"Your future seems so bright when you think about all the possibilities ahead, but you might not have the necessary discipline now to realize your goals. Paradoxically, your optimism creates complications because you can see success at the end of every path you consider, making it nearly impossible to choose your direction. Go easy on yourself today and continue to explore the various options without trying to pursue any one of them. Your current ideas will likely mellow within a few days so don't make any decisions you might regret."
sagittarius,2015-03-01,"It's all too easy to get annoyed with someone close to you today, especially if he or she can't comprehend the larger scheme of things. And, it only grows more frustrating if you try to explain your perspective again with the hope to be understood. It's possible that no amount of logic will get your point across, for the response you receive is more emotional than rational now. Accept the differences and just move forward with the goal of establishing middle ground later on."
capricorn,2015-03-01,"You have a rare opportunity to push your way through any subconscious fears that have been keeping you from your dreams. This is a great time to take a leap of faith and trust your feelings, even if they seem erratic to everyone else. Saying what's on your mind can surely trigger strong reactions from others and even temporarily destabilize your emotional security. However, the risk is worth it; relationships have the potential to be healthier than ever once the truth is on the table for all to see."
aquarius,2015-03-01,"You may find yourself at odds with a close friend now, especially if he or she is pushing you to do something that just doesn't hold your interest. However, you can't keep your negativity to yourself or it will fester and grow. Share your truth without expecting anyone to immediately understand your attitude. Revealing your secrets can act as a catalyst to get things moving again in the right direction. Practicing the art of compromise works in your favor if you keep an open mind."
pisces,2015-03-01,"You might feel as if you're arguing with yourself today, but others won't likely be aware of your inner turmoil. Your thoughts may grow intense, but there's no reason to shy away from them. Something that touches your core is arousing your intellect and your gut reaction doesn't fit into the current set of circumstances. Consciously deciding what to share and what to keep private is the best way to exercise your free will now. The key is to increase your personal space without pushing anyone away."
aries,2015-03-02,"You're inspired by your own creativity today, and quite pleased that your projects appear to be moving along on schedule. You know that the tide has shifted and things are flowing your way now. Although the present moment is always the best time to learn a lesson about life, it's currently more important to seize the day and have some fun. The truth is your best work is done when you are happy."
taurus,2015-03-02,"There's no fast track to success; nevertheless, you can develop a practice that synchronizes your head and your heart since they are often tugging in different directions. Even if you know exactly what you're feeling now, circumstances might still require you to act in a specific manner. Don't beat yourself up if the most logical solution isn't the ideal one. Stay open to all the voices coming from within. The stress will resolve on its own accord, allowing you to commit fully to a single path when you're ready."
gemini,2015-03-02,"You may hold onto unexpressed ideas that are difficult to bring out into the open. However, you still feel a primal need to take a necessary risk in order to be heard today. Unfortunately, the current circumstances are more complicated than you prefer to manage at this time. Although you usually enjoy having multiple choices, saying what's on your mind can be the catalyst that brings more simplicity to your life now."
cancer,2015-03-02,"Trusting others isn't always the easiest thing to do, but you're willing to open your heart to gain intimacy now. However, you don't want to sacrifice your stability just to feel connected to someone special. Fortunately, you may have a chance to gain financial and emotional security without giving up on the priceless intangibles. Make a commitment to honor both your need for safety and your desire for love. Don't hold back; you deserve it all."
leo,2015-03-02,"You are probably sowing your oats now that the provocative Moon is back in your sign for a visit. In fact, you're feeling it all -- the good, the bad and the ugly -- at a louder volume than usual. It may be challenging to keep your emotions quiet, yet a fortunate outcome is indicated if you honestly share your heart's desires today. Just make sure that communication travels in both directions. Take the time to acknowledge the special gifts that others bring to the table. The spotlight is big enough for everyone."
virgo,2015-03-02,"You are receiving an unexpected burst of energy now, but it's not without some complications. You're eager to take a trip -- in the real world or within the realms of your own mind. In either case, you have a multitude of details to attend to and are anxious to get started. But before doing anything else, you must be in the right frame of mind. You can't step into the next adventure until you finish what's already on your plate. A positive attitude makes all the difference in the world."
libra,2015-03-02,"Your current concerns may stem from your uncertainty about using your recent accomplishments to solidify your position at work. Naturally, you don't want your past efforts to be for naught, yet circumstances are changing swiftly and you must change with them or be left behind. Concentrate on the best parts of your past achievements and consider how to repackage your skills for the future. Your mental agility is your key to success."
scorpio,2015-03-02,"It seems as if everyone is depending on you today, making you eager to deliver on all of your promises. However, your good intentions may fall to the wayside if you believe that someone is taking your contribution for granted. You're not interested in playing hard to get now; you truly want to do your part and more. Instead of letting your feelings sour, be honest and let others know what you need from them, too. You might be pleasantly surprised when they respond in a way that goes beyond your greatest expectations. The more open you are, the better."
sagittarius,2015-03-02,"Your much-anticipated travel plans are finally beginning to take shape now. You're at the threshold of a great adventure without knowing any of the details and previous resistance continues to fall away. You receive an extra burst of energy now as there are six planets moving through active fire signs. Fortunately, a lunar trine to realistic Saturn in your sign encourages you to concentrate on one single goal and work to make your dreams come true. Nearly anything is possible if you can narrow your focus and follow your heart."
capricorn,2015-03-02,"You are surfing on a creative high, but it's nearly impossible to find a sustainable pace. Luckily, you have the capability and stamina to handle even the most complicated projects now. Although someone else might be pulling the strings today, you still have enough latitude to move as you desire. Just remember that your determination is your greatest ally. Nevertheless, don't try to accomplish too much at once; as you well know, a methodical approach leads to your best work."
aquarius,2015-03-02,"Sorting out relationship dynamics may take more energy than you have to offer today. Although you set high expectations, you don't seem to get the results you want. Paradoxically, the more you know, the less certain you are about what you want. Step out of the rational world of knowing and into the illogical realm of feelings. Even if your emotions are less comfortable than your thoughts, this is an excellent opportunity to express what's in your heart in a new and innovative way."
pisces,2015-03-02,"Trying to distinguish your subjective needs from what makes the most sense can be tricky business. On one hand, you realize there are specific things you want to do today, and you won't be satisfied until you do them. On the other hand, you may lose patience with playing games and could lose a significant opportunity for fulfillment if you're unable to compromise. Just remember, this isn't about choosing one side or the other. There's plenty of room for several shades of gray between the black and the white."
aries,2015-03-03,"Although you have an abundance of innovative ideas today, you could squander your gift of ingenuity if you aren't careful. However, you might not know exactly what to do with your excess physical and spiritual energy. Wasting your time on something unimportant can be draining, but, fortunately, you won't likely be distracted for too long. You are at the peak of your creative cycle now, so go ahead and jump into every experience with the intent to maximize the opportunities that come knocking at your door."
taurus,2015-03-03,"You might not understand all the complex dynamics that are impacting your family relationships while the futuristic Uranus trines expansive Jupiter in your 4th House of Roots. Nevertheless, you can feel the electricity in the atmosphere now so you know something big is brewing. Don't get discouraged by your current lack of clarity. Maintaining your previously established course could be tricky today, yet being patient is still your best strategy until the energy settles down. Being the dependable one isn't always easy, but it's often the role you play the best."
gemini,2015-03-03,"You may be so overwhelmed by the wide array of tasks you need to complete today that you can't decide where to begin. As soon as you pick a specific plan, something unexpected happens that requires you to reconsider your strategy. Although your choices should prove to be the right ones in the long run, temporary frustration can set in if you don't get what you want right away. There are no absolute answers that will solve everything now. Nevertheless, your positive attitude is your most useful tool if you're not afraid to use it."
cancer,2015-03-03,"Stability seems highly overrated today as your optimism reveals potential success stories every which way you turn. But don't dive into a new project just because it looks like an easy cure to your restlessness. Too much searching for the next big thing can blind you to the joys of the present moment. Instead of feeding your current penchant for change, dig in your heels and create a little excitement right where you are. The magic begins within."
leo,2015-03-03,"Everyone seems to think your heart is like an open book now that the evocative Moon is moving through demonstrative Leo. However, chances are that no one actually knows your true desires, even if they attempt to convince you that they do. Unfortunately, your emotions can get in the way of your words, so you might not be very effective when you try to explain what you want. Tone down your expectations and practice flexibility; asking for less could ultimately bring you more than you need."
virgo,2015-03-03,"You may have been suffering in silence for too long with hidden tension at home or on the job. Taking a calculated risk to put things back in order is a good idea today because you have invisible cosmic helpers working on your behalf. However, you might feel so lucky that you can reach too far in pursuit of perfection. Remember, there's no reason to cling to the status quo; change the emotional dynamics in a relationship by putting your feelings out on the table and then wait for others to do the same."
libra,2015-03-03,"You feel blessed to have wonderful friends who are enthusiastic about being an integral part of your life. However, you may grow annoyed if they are more of a distraction now than it's worth. Nevertheless, your responsibilities are probably more negotiable than you realize. There's no need to take yourself so seriously; no one will fault you for enjoying yourself as long as you eventually return to your obligations. Spread your wings and fly while you have the chance."
scorpio,2015-03-03,"It doesn't matter how ingenious your thoughts are now; they aren't likely grounded in experience or logic. However, your intuition won't lead you astray; it's wise to act on your desires because the odds for fulfillment are high. But don't expect someone to show up out of the blue and deliver your fantasies. Enjoy playing out the possibilities in your mind without feeling the need to make them real just yet.

aquarius,2015-03-03,"A close friend or ally might offer you extra support today as brilliant Uranus harmonizes with the big-hearted Leo Moon in your 7th House of Others. Even the most casual conversation could bring forth a flood of new ideas. However, no matter how hard you try, you cannot possibly pursue every path. Don't waste energy defending your strategy to the wrong audience. Stop walking on eggshells to avoid conflict; gently find a peaceful solution, instead. Follow your bliss and the rest will fall into place."
pisces,2015-03-03,"Although you might butt heads with someone at work, you won't likely get to the source of the squabble today. Your interactions with your coworkers aren't as simple as they seem on the surface, for unspoken feelings make attempts to clear the air awkward. Thankfully, you can reduce the emotional charge of an unpleasant situation by considering the larger picture, instead of only focusing on what's in it for you. Cooperation breeds success."
aries,2015-03-04,"Your passions are aroused today and you are anxious to tell the world what you want. Expressing your feelings in an acceptable manner can lead to a memorable outcome as romantic Venus joins unpredictable Uranus in your spontaneous sign.

Nevertheless, be adventurous now, live outside the constraints of negativity and open your heart!"
taurus,2015-03-04,"There is something about the experience of pleasure today that makes you purr with contentment, no matter what else is occurring in your life.

gemini,2015-03-04,"If you want to spice up your life today, make a few phone calls and put some fun on your calendar. Today is not a day to idly sit by and watch others enjoying themselves when you should just jump in and join the party. But don't be satisfied with superficial interactions now when sincere conversations leave you with more enduring and honest connections. Speak from your heart; if you're lucky, you get out of a relationship whatever you put into it."
cancer,2015-03-04,"Even if you continue to ride the emotional roller coaster today, it won't carry you away from a very sweet encounter that's already on your radar. Getting together with a loved one to share a special meal might ignite romantic sparks. However, your fear of intimacy could close the door to a magnificent experience before it even occurs. Happily, if you commit to following your heart now, the potential love that is all around you has a chance to take flight."
leo,2015-03-04,"Wonderful news could be a welcome surprise today, but you must be receptive to the message or it might pass you by unnoticed. The current reward or acknowledgment probably won't be what you expect now, which makes it even sweeter. You may even receive an unexpected cash windfall or meet a very special person. Keep your eyes peeled, but don't try to control the flow of events; just enjoy the good fortune while it lasts."
virgo,2015-03-04,"It's much healthier to express your feelings than to keep them to yourself, especially now that the sensitive Moon is back in your sign. It's worth going out on a limb, even if you're nervous about the reaction you might receive. Although your assertive behavior is contrary to your natural tentative style, trying a totally new approach to life today gives you a fresh edge.

scorpio,2015-03-04,"Your confidence is the ultimate key to your happiness today, even in the most difficult situations. In fact, it's as if you don't even have to work that hard for recognition and money. Naturally, it helps if you love what you're doing, since your attachment to the routines over a long period of time is what really pays off now. However, if you're not thriving in your current lifestyle, it's time to figure out a way to bring the missing pleasure back into your life. Do whatever makes you feel good about yourself and success will follow."
sagittarius,2015-03-04,"You can feel the emotional buzz and you can't wait to see what's around the next corner. If this cosmic energy doesn't bring love or romance, find other ways to express your creativity as bountiful Jupiter receives a delicious kiss from beautiful Venus today. Even if you have struggled recently, your enthusiasm is contagious now. Nearly everyone is more optimistic while in your presence, prompting them to seek you out for fun and games. It's a tough job being the life of the party, but if invited, just say yes."
capricorn,2015-03-04,"It's not about accomplishing more in the outer world now; it's simply about engaging your senses in new and different ways. You don't have to impress anyone with your success story. You only have to give yourself permission to relax and let down your guard. Entertain the notion of breaking the rules for once. Remember, this isn't a long-lasting transit, so you can get back to being more goal-oriented tomorrow. Even you reliable Goats need to kick up your heels now and then."
aquarius,2015-03-04,"You might feel as if no one is watching you and you can get away with some mischief today. However, don't push your luck too far or your day could implode when you least expect it. Thankfully, even if you go overboard, you may be able to put everything back on track quickly. Your charm works in your favor now, so joyfully accept the love that is all around you. Just don't be greedy and expect more than is available. Show your gratitude by seeking satisfaction from your current blessings, rather than longing for something else."
pisces,2015-03-04,"Everything at work may be going so well now that you're secretly concerned about which good feelings you should really trust. You might want to hold something in reserve in case things don't turn out as you planned. Fortunately, your destiny is within your control if you decide to consciously wake up and take preemptive action. Don't wait for something unexpected to occur; imagine the best-case scenario and then make it happen. Opportunity may be knocking, but you must actively let it in or go out and meet it halfway to produce the results you want."
aries,2015-03-05,"You can't figure out why you feel anxious today, so you might as well stop trying. It's as if the prescription lenses on your glasses keep changing, making it impossible to trust your vision. Although you may think you know exactly what is going on, the facts don't add up correctly. Forget about comprehending the big picture now that the Virgo Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Details. Rather than knowing a little bit about everything, you are better off understanding a lot about the specific work at hand."
taurus,2015-03-05,"You might feel like a little kid today, eager to play hooky and follow every whim while the Virgo Full Moon highlights your 5th House of Play. You can see things in new and unusual ways and you're not afraid of taking an experimental approach to experiences now. Even if the outcome is not what you expect, you probably won't have regrets when all is said and done. Nevertheless, you can still run into trouble if you choose to bury important facts because they could impact a significant decision. Remember, ignorance is not bliss, so pursue the truth no matter where it leads."
gemini,2015-03-05,"Paradoxically, you might benefit from a bit of unexpected stress today as the picky Virgo Full Moon in your 4th House of Emotional Roots conflicts with your not-so-picky Gemini Sun. However, this personal dilemma motivates you to reach a critical decision. You are at a fork in the road and must choose one path. Although you will have to live with the consequences of your current choice, you don't need more time to think it over. You have enough information at your disposal; the moment is now to use your knowledge for the good of all."
cancer,2015-03-05,"You want others to be as responsible as you, but you're not in a position to judge them for their shortcomings. The critical Virgo Full Moon brightens your 3rd House of Communication, prompting you to talk about your concerns with your closest friends. However, an honest discussion might reveal that you are tempted to walk away from your obligations; your initial observation is likely more about yourself than anyone else. There's no need to further rationalize your emotions now. Just don't be so hard on someone who is simply doing what you wish you could do yourself."
leo,2015-03-05,"You may be spinning in circles today because there are hidden influences destabilizing your world. However, you have no one to fight if you're unable to see your enemy or hunt down the source of a problem. The Virgo Full Moon accentuates your 2nd House of Core Beliefs, testing your values by confronting you with uncertainty and confusion. There's no need to try to control something that is beyond your current reach. Happiness might just be your reward for remaining open to the mysteries of the universe."
virgo,2015-03-05,"Your feelings are all over the map today as the Full Moon in your sign heightens your emotional sensitivity, no matter how much you want to be rational. Your moods aren't very stable now, especially if you are trying to build a relationship on a false assumption. Although your current changes aren't necessarily long lasting, you would be wise to pay close attention to anything that is falling apart. Don't get pulled off track; demonstrate your strength of purpose by focusing on whatever needs to be fixed and ignoring the rest."
libra,2015-03-05,"Your emotions might not conform to other people's expectations today, creating both excitement and frustration. Don't worry if the Virgo Full Moon's presence in your 12th House of Imagination means that you cannot neatly fit into a compartment that someone has created for you. Your unconventional energy will eventually settle back down, but it could take a few more days before you return to your regular routine. In the meantime, continue coloring outside the lines and your closest friends will support your burst of inspiration in due time."
scorpio,2015-03-05,"Your friends may question your actions today if you close your eyes and check out of a conversation. Contrary to their beliefs, you are not engaging in escapist behavior; rather, you are doing important creative work. The Virgo Full Moon sparkles in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, activating dreams of future times and distant lands. But even if you're drifting in and out of your imagination, you can set the stage for what's ahead by bringing your thoughts back down to earth and being as practical as possible when executing your plans."
sagittarius,2015-03-05,"You might feel lost as you try to bridge the gulf between your professional obligations and your philosophical approach. Today's analytical Virgo Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Career, temporarily demanding that you set aside your personal feelings while you attend to business. Nevertheless, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition. Consciously acknowledging your inner process supplies the necessary key that helps you navigate through the outer turmoil. Peace begins at home."
capricorn,2015-03-05,"It's no simple task to keep your goals in perspective today because the narrowing Virgo Full Moon shines in your expansive 9th House of Big Ideas. The tiniest detail might suddenly become your ultimate concern as a current project morphs into something entirely different from your expectations. Your role at work is changing, but there's no need to get bent out of shape. Radical reactions won't help you in the long run; keep calm and carry on."
aquarius,2015-03-05,"You might be struggling with existential questions about reality today as the Virgo Full Moon lights up your 8th House of Transformation. A current relationship may become unmanageable now as the power dynamics shift suddenly. Profound changes make it nearly impossible to figure out what to do next. However, this uncertainty isn't a result of any shortcoming on your part, so push away all self-doubt. Postpone important decisions until next week when your clarity returns. In the meantime, take one tiny step after another. Even small gains now will eventually add up to success."
pisces,2015-03-05,"Even the best relationships seem like an enigma today as the perfectionist Virgo Full Moon rattles your 7th House of Others. A close friend or partner might suddenly become overly demanding of your time or critical of your work now, and the most casual interaction could be emotionally overwhelming. Thankfully, retreating into your imagination offers everyone a bit of much-needed breathing room. Paradoxically, taking care of yourself first deepens your well of compassion for the rest of the world in the long run."
aries,2015-03-06,"There's no reason to waste words rationalizing your actions now, since it appears the more you share your thoughts, the less clear others become. It isn't that you're on a wrong track; it's just that you can't explain yourself very well today. Channel your copious energy into your work because it's critical that you live up to your commitments without further excuses. Promise less and then surprise others by delivering more."
taurus,2015-03-06,"You wish you could garner more support from your coworkers today, but you might be feeling so outrageously confident that you inadvertently ask for too much. Thankfully, your charming nature is quite endearing as long as you don't take someone for granted. Respect other people's limits while acknowledging the constraints of the current circumstances. Being true to yourself is your best strategy now, as long as you give others the chance to do the same for themselves."
gemini,2015-03-06,"You logically know that narrowing your focus can help you accomplish more at work, but you still can't resist checking out every new distraction that comes your way. You're curious about every person you encounter and are eager to engage in an interesting conversation over performing another boring task. Unfortunately, you might have to bite the bullet and postpone expanding your horizons for a little while. There's no reason to complain when you have so many options at your disposal; just do your job today and return to your explorations tomorrow."
cancer,2015-03-06,"Your coworkers might well-intentionally make promises that are impossible to fulfill today. Rest assured no one is trying to mislead you on purpose; it's just easy to be swept up in a moment of sheer optimism. It's wise to take commitments with a grain of salt now, without assuming that others will follow through on what they say. However, you can still be responsible for your own actions so you don't need to directly involve anyone else and then feel disappointed if they let you down."
leo,2015-03-06,"You can make even the most boring chore sound like a ton of fun today, but it will still be a drag, no matter how much you dress it up. Your natural ability to dramatize the facts might also be useful for creating an excuse if you want to avoid an unpleasant task now. Nevertheless, be careful not to stretch the truth so far that you get caught in your own web of deceit. Sometimes it's more magical to accept things as they are than to transform them into something else."
virgo,2015-03-06,"Although you are usually quite exacting in how you put facts together like puzzle pieces, you're tempted to bend reality in your favor today to make them fit. Ironically, you might not even be aware of your current subjectivity. Luckily, you're intelligent enough to strive for an objective approach. There's no need to exaggerate; the truth is more powerful than any story you could ever make up. Take the highest road possible and just be honest."
libra,2015-03-06,"Although your senses may be overstimulated today, your irrational fascination with a new idea could steer you into the weeds. The attractions of your key planet Venus are still pulling you all over the place because she is traveling through spontaneous Aries. However, the single-minded Virgo Moon prevents you from fulfilling your fantasies. Reaching satisfaction later this evening when the Moon is back in your sign."
scorpio,2015-03-06,You are tempted to sweeten a bitter pill with a spoonful of sugar today because you think you might have a better chance of being heard if you're extra nice to everyone. But your strategy of playing the role of the perfect messenger is tricky business. Don't jeopardize your credibility by embellishing your story for the sake of temporary harmony. It's better to be acknowledged for telling a difficult truth now rather than being admired for creating a work of fiction.
sagittarius,2015-03-06,"You might not think you can reach your goals now, especially if you let self-doubt creep into the picture. Normally, your unflagging confidence carries you through periods of uncertainty so you don't feel lost. But you could get so hung up on an unimportant detail today that it casts a shadow on the big picture. Fortunately, you don't have to fall victim to your current obsession if you simply remember to keep your eyes on the distant horizon. Dramatically altering your perspective gives you more a wealth of options and improves your chances for success."
capricorn,2015-03-06,"Your current enthusiasm about your latest new project might stir a lot of interest today. Nevertheless, you must have valid data to support your plan or others will abandon you just as quickly as they initially joined in. Don't make waves; finish out your workweek by delivering on your commitments. If your current idea is really as lucrative as it sounds, it will still be waiting for you next week. Remember, the tortoise, not the hare, wins the race."
aquarius,2015-03-06,"Following a hunch out of the blue often works in your favor, but today a sudden change of direction might create more trouble than it's worth. You can visualize the potential in almost every situation now, but your optimism makes it difficult to see things as they truly are. Take a little extra time to objectively analyze the circumstances before signing on to be part of the team. It's wiser to see everything in its true light than in the rosy glow of your idealistic dreams."
pisces,2015-03-06,"Your unflagging loyalty is a real gift to your closest friends, but your exuberance can grow out of hand now. Although everyone appreciates your vote of support, it's wise to save your approval until you have done the necessary research to flush out the facts. Performing a reality check is more important than ever. Recognizing the truth today can save you from unnecessary discouragement tomorrow."
aries,2015-03-07,"An urgent issue continues to overshadow your day, and you may feel as if you can't put off addressing it any longer. But be careful about taking the quick and easy way out; whatever you do, don't stop short of making your point. The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Companions tempts you to hold your tongue for the sake of someone else's feelings. There's no need to push too hard for immediate resolution today but make sure that you share whatever you need to say as clearly as possible. Telling the truth is an act of kindness."
taurus,2015-03-07,"It seems as if the hand of fate is in control of your interpersonal interactions today. Something odd is happening and you can't put your finger on it. The more you try to remember the specific issues that set your feelings into motion, the less certain things become now. Although there could be unknown factors influencing your day, don't give up. Your positive attitude is still enough to sway circumstances in your favor. When push comes to shove, you're the master of your own destiny."
gemini,2015-03-07,"A lighthearted conversation could get sticky today, especially if everyone tries to cling to their positions without being open to negotiation. Even a discussion that appears to be heading somewhere productive might quickly bog down as soon as you assume your perspective is the best one. However, your resistance begins to fade when you accept that individuals can have differing valid points of view. Entertain the magical potential of each alternative instead of worrying about what might go wrong. Variety is the spice of life."
cancer,2015-03-07,"You can appear even-tempered today, even if your moods are more extreme. A minor power struggle at home could generate an emotional tidal wave, yet you might not let on how much the stress is affecting you. Releasing your attachment to your dreams enables you to remain honest without having to hide your feelings. Projecting objectivity is a sensible strategy that helps to alleviate the tension and open the channels of communication."
leo,2015-03-07,"It's all too easy to just acquiesce and go along with someone else's agenda today even if you're aware of the imperfections in their plans. You're more accommodating now and are willing to make allowances for other people's shortcomings. However, don't just say yes to everyone who asks you for a favor. It's a real gift to support your friends by offering a helping hand as long as you don't set aside your own goals along the way. Your generous spirit won't go unappreciated by those who matter."
virgo,2015-03-07,"You believe that a straightforward approach to your chores is the most productive route today, but your intensity might be bothersome to those around you. You're quick to turn a complex set of tasks into a simple concrete plan, leaving others in awe of your practical wizardry. Nevertheless, you're still likely to cause trouble now by stepping on someone's toes as you proceed. Being efficient is an admirable goal, but it isn't worth the risk of upsetting friends and family. You can create a win-win situation by taking the time to include those you love in the process."
libra,2015-03-07,"You might sound more easygoing than you actually feel today. Someone may even think you're so ambivalent that you can't make a simple choice on your own. However, the gracious Libra Moon gives you the wisdom to go along with others for the sake of establishing a stronger bond. You're prepared to express your opinions once you're comfortable with the dynamics of the situation, which may take a while longer. But rather than engaging in an unimportant squabble, speak up only when it really matters. Trust your instincts when it comes to sharing your heart."
scorpio,2015-03-07,"A window of opportunity appears to be shutting today, yet you are not quite ready to make a leap of faith. Although you are usually capable of asserting your will when necessary, you're reticent to express what you need now. Fortunately, a friend may provide a spark of encouragement that enables you to move past your own resistance and reach for the stars. Following the advice of a trustworthy ally makes all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2015-03-07,"Alternating waves of uncertainty and confidence finally give way to calmer waters today. Luckily, your feelings are bolstered by your friends and family. Instead of struggling to justify your choices, all you need to do is show up and others seem to approve. The positive feedback may seem puzzling at first, but there's no room for self-doubt; the time to act is now. Be grateful for your support network and keep your focus on the future."
capricorn,2015-03-07,"You are cool-headed today, possessing the strategic objectivity of a master chess player. Your skills are highly marketable, which is useful when pursuing your ambitions. In fact, you have an excellent chance of reaching your goals now. Although your emotionally detached logic may be appropriate at work, it comes across as cold and unfeeling to family members or friends in a domestic setting. Take time and connect on a heart-to-heart level for satisfaction that's beyond measure."
aquarius,2015-03-07,"It's as if you are lifted high above the chimney tops and humdrum worries of the mundane world as your imagination soars to new heights. But you may be hesitant to relinquish your earthy subjectivity because you're afraid you might not be able to return to ground level when duty calls. Nevertheless, worrying about being practical isn't in your best interest today; your responsibilities will still be there tomorrow. In the meantime, explore the amazing possibilities that lay dormant in your dreams just waiting for you to discover them."
pisces,2015-03-07,"Relationship dynamics continue to shift, making it nearly impossible to figure out where you will land. On one hand, your dreams are more colorful and vibrant, putting you directly in touch with the supernatural realms. On the other hand, your visions also seem more real and reachable than ever. Don't panic; your common sense will keep your feet on the ground now even when your thoughts drift off into space."
aries,2015-03-08,"You may wish you could be a hermit today, but previous obligations to others might stand in your way. You don't mind being in the company of someone you admire, but you're not interested in playing a supporting role in anyone else's drama now. Even if you are socially oriented by nature, it's healthier to get back in touch with your own needs than to be distracted by trying to meet another person's expectations. Spending some quality time alone enables you to cultivate deeper connections later on."
taurus,2015-03-08,"Although you might instinctively know that slowing down is wise, you still could resent the limitations that your current commitments place upon you. Instead of stubbornly fighting against the resistance you face today, just let go of your personal agenda for a while. Your path is in the process of opening and will continue to do so if you don't pressure everyone to follow your plan. Relax and go with the flow if you want others to support your efforts. Keep calm and trust the process."
gemini,2015-03-08,"You're not very interested in listening to other people's criticism today. It isn't that your self-image is based upon idealistic illusions; it's just that you can see the flaws in your relationships as well as anyone else. Thankfully, you know your feelings come and go, like the rising and falling of the tides, so it's pointless to struggle against strong currents when your efforts would be futile. Wait for the tide to change before announcing your ambitious intentions for the future."
cancer,2015-03-08,"Although nearly everyone seems to go out of the way to be nice to you now, you can intuitively sense if they're being shallow. You don't like it when anyone says positive things just to get your attention. However, other people may genuinely want to be your friends. Moving past your fears and expressing your concerns will force the issue, enabling you to see if your initial suspicion was well founded. Be honest; maintaining your integrity is more important than anything else."
leo,2015-03-08,"There may be noticeable forward movement concerning family dynamics today, but resolution still isn't progressing as fast as you wish. Everything is taking more time than it should, so your actions don't seem to have the desired impact. But rather than being too self-critical or becoming frustrated, a smarter strategy now might be to take a step back and retreat. Stop chasing your tail for no reason; instead, be kind to yourself and replenish your energy reserves while you have the chance."
virgo,2015-03-08,"An inkling of self-doubt could lead you to reconsider a recent decision, especially if you were not realistic about assessing your abilities. Your assumptions may be totally irrational now and your expectations markedly exaggerated. However, you will begin to see things in their proper light again very soon. Don't quit prematurely; you might feel discouraged today, yet the situation will likely work out beneficially in the long run. Believing in yourself is the first step to success."
libra,2015-03-08,"Your emotional expression might be blocked today, but you are probably willing to shift your attention to long-term career goals. Make sure that your interest in professional aspirations isn't just a means of escaping from your personal problems. Paradoxically, you may reflect back on this time with appreciation for everything you had to endure as circumstances required you to make constructive changes. Don't waste energy fighting the inevitable. Letting go of control now helps to make room for new opportunities around the next corner."
scorpio,2015-03-08,"You may be a harsh judge of yourself or others, and could inadvertently push a long-time ally away. But regardless of what you actually do today, fate ultimately plays a deciding role in the outcome of events. It's not worth the effort to limit your options, even if you can't see the positive possibilities of the current situation. Thankfully, most minor problems seem bigger now than they actually are and will resolve naturally in just a few days. Instead of placing so much weight on the future, just go along for the cosmic ride and see where you land."
sagittarius,2015-03-08,"The tables are turned and you might be having a tough time keeping up with everyone in your life now. Some of your closest friends or relatives appear to be moving faster than you are today, yet you're not feeling particularly motivated to catch up. Everyone has a different role to play in this life, so you don't have to maintain a hectic pace unless it's warranted. Acknowledging you can't do it all might make you feel uncomfortable. Nevertheless, letting go of dreams that have not panned out gives you the chance to find ones that will make you happier in the long run."
capricorn,2015-03-08,"Your persistently practical outlook on life enables you to be less emotional about cutting your losses  and moving on. However, it's not a good idea to react too quickly because vulnerable Venus bumps into somber Saturn today, subduing pleasure and delaying gratification. You might sell yourself short now, so wait a few days before making any significant decisions. Although the odds don't appear to be in your favor yet, the energy will shift in response to your good intentions and unwavering heart."
aquarius,2015-03-08,"It isn't wise to pin all your hopes for personal satisfaction on a romantic relationship because you would be better off now to aim for a higher expression of love. Sensual enjoyment is not completely out of the question, but a deeper friendship and a more spiritual connection bring you greater happiness at this time. Nevertheless, even if the fulfillment of a wonderful fantasy seems out of reach today, don't let that stop you from aspiring toward becoming a more compassionate human being. Instead of searching for the perfect partner, strive to be the best person you can be."
pisces,2015-03-08,"Maintaining a cheerful attitude can be challenging today, especially if you are feeling as if you have missed your chance to achieve satisfaction. Don't give up on your old dreams, even if you are disappointed by the current course of events. Your vision is being tested now; it's not a viable option to take the easy way out by just discarding what's important to you. Keep the faith, no matter what. Honoring your values rather than your goals is the fastest way to rediscover your center."
aries,2015-03-09,"You can't help but say yes to a special invitation today, even if you think you should be more practical. You get along famously with others while your key planet Mars is harmonizing with joyful Jupiter. Nevertheless, don't take the easiest path just because you can; putting in a little extra effort could turn a wonderful opportunity into the most extraordinary one ever. The more fun you have, the more progress you make toward reaching your goals. Go for the gold and give it your absolute best."
taurus,2015-03-09,"You might be needlessly licking your wounds from an emotional disappointment yesterday. Although warrior Mars is waving his banner today, you don't have to go to battle to achieve a victory. The truth is you only need to be honest and speak from your heart. However, be ready to back up your words with action, if needed. There's no reason to look behind you when there is so much potential just ahead."
gemini,2015-03-09,"You are motivated to make a name for yourself by climbing the ladder of success today, and it appears as if your efforts will soon be rewarded. However, your outward accomplishments may not be as important now as your recent change of attitude. Even if reaching your goal takes longer than you expect, your confidence allows you to shine like a star. Friends and coworkers support your ambitions because they respect and admire you. Don't abuse anyone's trust by making false promises. Your authenticity is the key to your success."
cancer,2015-03-09,"Although you are often happy to play the role of a nurturing friend, you have a tricky time balancing your feelings due to the deeper emotions that are working their way to the surface today. It's as if there are contrary sides to your personality vying for recognition. This inner conflict may be just as confusing to you as is to others. Nevertheless, you can avoid a misunderstanding if you're straightforward about your complicated intentions right from the start."
leo,2015-03-09,"Ironically, you feel good about what you see in your future, but you may be missing an important piece of the puzzle. Instead of only concentrating on the approval you receive from others and the good fortune coming your way now, look within yourself to create a more meaningful existence. Reconsider your basic values, analyze your recent assumptions and uncover hidden issues, even if there are more thorns than flowers. Everything is less scary in the light of awareness."
virgo,2015-03-09,"You are highly capable of managing your business affairs now, but unexpected assistance from a good friend or friendly advice from a coworker could make your life a lot easier. Naturally, you can be your own superhero, but today's cosmic energy is so positive for relationships, it's not smart to go off and do something important by yourself. Involving others in your activities encourages camaraderie and makes the day one to remember."
libra,2015-03-09,"You can express yourself with an assertive flair today, especially through artistic creation or spontaneous behavior. Unfortunately, words might fail you now, so don't bother trying to explain your emotions; follow your instincts and demonstrate your feelings, instead. When all is said and done, your actions really do speak louder than anything else."
scorpio,2015-03-09,"You don't need to tone down your intensity today; your powerful emotions are compelling and your friends and acquaintances will probably want more of you rather than less. You are so highly attuned to sexy Mars that it's nearly impossible to wipe that all-knowing smile off your face. Luckily, exuberant Jupiter encourages you to take charge. Just remember to consider your desires carefully before sharing them with someone else. Otherwise, you might receive what you wished for, even if it's not in your best interests."
sagittarius,2015-03-09,"Your high spirits are inspirational today as optimistic Jupiter raises new possibilities everywhere you look. The secret to your success is to align your heart with energetic Mars and act on your desires. Thankfully, expressing your emotions moves you closer to someone you really like. Although love is favored now, don't become so sure of yourself that you miss the obvious signals right in front of your face."
capricorn,2015-03-09,"Sometimes you aren't the greatest communicator in the world, especially when it involves sharing emotions that make you feel vulnerable. Nevertheless, you tend to fare better today if you can steer clear of more rational realms. You're willing to reveal your feelings, even if you don't know where the other person stands. It's not time to be shy when it comes to acknowledging what's in your heart. Softening your established boundaries can open up new possibilities for love."
aquarius,2015-03-09,"You may believe you're slipping and sliding down a slippery slope of emotions now as you share your ambitions for the future. However, this journey of revelation is not about furthering your career goals or finding your life purpose. It's more about an illogical attraction, a warm and fuzzy feeling that often acts like a warning sign -- especially when your heart mean business. There's no valid reason to keep your dreams to yourself; take a risk and tell someone special how much you really care."
pisces,2015-03-09,"Your enthusiasm may be over the top today, or, perhaps, you are experiencing someone else's positive attitude. In either case, there's more going on than meets the eye, and, fortunately, what comes to the surface now can be quite pleasant. Don't try to hide your feelings, even if you're worried that things could turn out badly. Be courageous and put your wishes out in the open for the world to hear. If you don't gamble with your heart you'll never know what could happen."
aries,2015-03-10,"You have set your agenda in stone and won't be easily distracted from your goals today. Your unrelenting drive might seem obsessive to your peers; however, you should still be able to present a more lighthearted demeanor, even if you're secretly freaking out. Although your unwavering determination is a powerful asset, it's still wise to know when to call it a day. Thankfully, time isn't running out as fast as you think now, so take a moment to acknowledge how much progress you have already made."
taurus,2015-03-10,"Your tenacity can help you win a tough argument today, but the price you must pay could be too severe. The Moon's shift into your 7th House of Companions raises the stakes in an intense disagreement. Your victory will likely be hollow if an emotional drama drains you of your energy. Make the best case you can for your point of view, but then be willing to shift gears and meet others halfway. Connecting on common ground creates a sense of camaraderie for everyone involved."
gemini,2015-03-10,"Manipulating reality can be as simple as choosing your words carefully. You are extremely clever at smoothly altering other people's perceptions without anyone being aware of your shenanigans. Unfortunately, you might not realize the lasting impact you can have on those around you. Thankfully, reconsidering your objectives before saying anything avoids accidentally hurting someone near and dear to your heart. Use your power of persuasion for the good of all."
cancer,2015-03-10,"Expressing yourself with unrestrained intensity and unwavering certainty is empowering today. You're finally ready to let someone at work know exactly how you feel, but it's still tricky to bring your complex emotions out into the open. Your feelings may be bouncing all over the place, and no single action can describe all the nuances. Stepping outside your comfort zone requires courage. Nevertheless, taking a risk by sharing your perspective reliably chips away at the walls that separate you from your peers."
leo,2015-03-10,"You can see the positive side of nearly anything today, even in a situation that others think is hopeless. It's not that you are in denial; it's just that you're simultaneously optimistic and pessimistic now, giving you an advantage when collaborating with your coworkers. Fortunately, they will be more than willing to follow your lead once they realize your intentions are completely authentic. Trust your intuition to steer you in the right direction."
virgo,2015-03-10,"You are at the top of your game today, applying your intelligence to navigate your way out of an emotionally intense predicament. At first, you may worry that you're being lured into a situation that could trap you. But upon a more detailed analysis, you return to the power of positive thought. Don't allow temporary limitations to prevent you from achieving success; instead, face the obstacles and let your adrenaline fuel your growth."
libra,2015-03-10,"Although you may be hopeful about the trajectory of a current relationship, your emotions are running on high alert today. You prefer to minimize the drama, but the stress seems to follow you now wherever you go. Instead of avoiding involvement, remain open to another person's process without feeding your own fears into the story. Ultimately, your optimistic attitude can tilt the scales in a positive direction. Being a good listener could be enough to alleviate the current intensity and calm everyone's nerves."
scorpio,2015-03-10,"You might be inexplicably fearful of what you don't know today. The Moon's visit to your sign indicates a couple of days of heightened emotional activity, yet the changes you experience now are of long-lasting significance. You may react defensively by clinging onto an old relationship or memory that is no longer serving your best interests. But don't be reckless; suddenly dropping someone or something of value can be counterproductive. Take your time to see where the current energy leads before making a decision you can't undo."
sagittarius,2015-03-10,"You are tempted to hide your anger today as the inscrutable Scorpio Moon worms her way through your 12th House of Secrets. Nevertheless, your compelling attraction to someone special could lure your feelings out of the shadows while driving away any lingering negativity. You may resist taking a long, hard look at all your options because you are afraid of the depths you might have to explore. Just remember, anything that is buried now will likely work its way to the surface in a few days. Examining your heart isn't easy but the truth will set you free."
capricorn,2015-03-10,"Close friends and relatives might not realize what an invaluable source of strength they are for you now. The good news is they don't have to go to heroic measures to demonstrate their support. Just knowing that you have a team to lean on in a pinch is quite reassuring. Thankfully, you don't need to be rescued today. Nevertheless, graciously accepting assistance at the right time can catapult you to the next level of success."
aquarius,2015-03-10,"Your apparent optimism may be confusing today. Nevertheless, everyone sees you as a walking inspiration because your cheerful disposition motivates them to make an extra effort on the job. Although you're able to accomplish a lot of work on your own, you still might think you missed your mark. Getting stuck in your personal dissatisfaction won't help your cause. Instead, concentrate on the good you can do for others and your confidence will return quicker than you expect."
pisces,2015-03-10,"It seems as if there is a flock of angels watching over you today. Perhaps, someone or something is clearing a path for you right through a complicated situation. Rest assured that your choices are being supported by the cosmos, so be bold and reach out to help someone else. In this manner, you can be an energetic conduit, receiving blessings and then, in turn, passing them along to those who could use a little magic, too."
aries,2015-03-11,"Although everyone may appear to be going nuts, you feel as sane as ever. Then again, you may not be the best judge of reality now that your key planet Mars connects with crazy Uranus and passionate Pluto. You might not even realize that you're driving against the flow of traffic because you believe you possess super powers today -- and maybe you do. Nevertheless, it's not wise to assume you can magically escape the laws of the physical universe. Follow the rules by choice, not because it's required. If anyone can create order out of chaos, it's you."
taurus,2015-03-11,"You might not have a solution for a tense social dilemma yet, but you're able to keep relatively calm in spite of the pressure. Perhaps you realize that you can't single-handedly change the current instability, so you don't need to invest a lot of energy in trying to fix the situation. Naturally, you must do whatever is necessary to survive, but you can actually contribute positively by being the anchor in someone else's storm. People count on your dependability more than you know."
gemini,2015-03-11,"The current excitement at work gets your adrenaline going, but you're probably not as happy if you have to hide your feelings. Oftentimes, all you want to do is share the information that you have before moving on to what's next. However, a stormy emotional component makes everything more complex now. Maybe it's time to act as if you're the lightning and strike with unexpected brilliance and force. Telling the truth can upset the status quo but also clears the air of tension."
cancer,2015-03-11,"Your mind is chock full of original thoughts and you are eager to act on every single one of them. Unfortunately, you may need to get your plans approved by someone who doesn't seem so friendly to your cause right now. If you can't figure out how to get your share your ideas, you might discover that negative emotions quickly replace your intelligent visions. Don't let your feelings bottle up or you could ruin a good thing before you know it. Being your authentic self is more important than ever."
leo,2015-03-11,"You want everyone to know about your emotional turmoil now, but you don't want to go through the process of explaining everything to each person. Although actions speak louder than words, it's a mistake to believe that anyone will understand your true intentions if you just swing into motion without saying anything at all. Just remember that it's not their fault if you choose to hide your vulnerability. No one can come to your rescue if you don't ask for help."
virgo,2015-03-11,"Nothing much has changed since yesterday, but you might feel more playful today. Instead of worrying about everything you can't control, you have surrendered to just letting go. But it would be incorrect to say that you have thrown in the towel. You're simply reconsidering your strategy and changing your tactics because you must. However, don't lose track of the final destination if you want additional freedom in your life. Even if it appears that you are experiencing a setback, a delay only increases the energy and propels you even further."
libra,2015-03-11,"You may as well toss your calendar aside today because it only brings you frustration if you try to stick to your previously conceived schedule. But this doesn't mean that you can also shirk your responsibilities. Although you will still be held accountable, it's much easier to be creative if you do it on your own clock. Flexibility is your secret weapon in the war on mediocrity."
scorpio,2015-03-11,"There is no stopping you today because of the powerful stress generated by the catalytic alignment between your two key planets, Mars and Pluto. Fortunately, you are able to express your creative brilliance as long as you keep bringing your focus back to the business at hand. You don't have to live up to anyone else's expectations now; you can get away with being totally unconventional if you so choose. Somehow, even your most radical behavior seems acceptable to others. Walk on the wild side while you have the chance."
sagittarius,2015-03-11,"You might believe you already missed your opportunity to add an outrageous activity to your day. However, the truth is you can still act on an off-the-wall plan if you make it happen soon. Others are looking to you for inspiration, hoping you will pull a rabbit out of a hat. Don't worry about what everyone thinks; expressing your most brilliant ideas needs to be satisfying for you and not anyone else."
capricorn,2015-03-11,"You can't maintain the status quo by simply declaring your intention to do so. However, even your most concrete plans can't prevent the changing tides from wreaking havoc and raising self-doubt. Intellectually, you realize that risky behavior can pay off handsomely, but you're hesitant to gamble on anything yet. Maybe you are motivated by fear; maybe it's common sense. Either way, listen to your intuition and don't try to logically rationalize what doesn't feel right in your heart. You will know when the time is right to take a leap of faith."
aquarius,2015-03-11,"Your schedule seems totally unmanageable today and the more you try to reassert control over your daily routine, the faster you spin in circles. Fortunately, you can simply change the game entirely by loosening the reins and allowing the chips to fall as they may. You may be happily surprised with the results when you acquiesce and trust in the wisdom of the universe."
pisces,2015-03-11,"You have a significant decision to make today; you can either take preemptive action or wait for changing circumstances to force your hand. Fortunately, being the lightning bolt feels exhilarating, while being struck by it is a frightening experience. You are keenly aware of the stress, fiscal or emotional, and you can no longer pretend that it will resolve on its own. Thankfully, you don't need to have a solid plan in place. Just shake things up enough so they cannot possibly settle back down to the way they were. Any movement now is better than holding on to the status quo."
aries,2015-03-12,"It's in your best interest to cool off your overheated emotions, but common sense is hard to come by today. You may be cruising for a fight but unfortunately, there is no obvious target for your aggression. You just need a healthy outlet for your anger if circumstances aren't going your way. Nevertheless, don't bury your negativity or there will be a price to pay; just keep in mind that you don't have to act unconsciously on your fears. Thankfully, expanding your awareness increases your options."
taurus,2015-03-12,"You're longing to make an escape, but even if you can't get away for the day, spend some time in solitude when you get the chance. Try taking a walk during your lunch break, meditate someplace quiet or strike a yoga pose in the privacy of your office. Even dancing to your favorite music could help settle your nerves. One way or another, create space so you can hear your inner voice rather than the stressful demands of everyone around you."
gemini,2015-03-12,"You are still juggling a variety of scenarios, so it's nearly impossible to relax. Thankfully, there is light at the end of the proverbial tunnel. You can sense that big patterns are changing, but there won't be an overnight turnaround. You might continue to feel like others are blocking your progress, but resist any temptation to spill your resentment onto inappropriate targets. But neither should you ignore the situations that have created these feelings. Seeking a middle path is nearly always your best alternative when you have extreme choices to make."
cancer,2015-03-12,"You might feel as if you're ruling the roost today, but there is an unexpected distraction that prevents others from perceiving you as the nurturing mother hen. Perhaps you are slightly more insistent than usual. Or, maybe it's the chicks who are the more demanding ones.You might just need to demonstrate that it is indeed you who's in charge now. Thankfully, you know how to assert your authority while still being kind."
leo,2015-03-12,"Although a relationship looks good on paper, there are a few things that come to light today that you hadn't previously noticed. Emotional conflicts between you and others may surface now because you are so driven to succeed at this time in your life. Unfortunately, your admirable ambitions could be running amok. Consider tempering your goals with a healthy dose of moderation. Finding the right balance between work and play allows everyone to breathe easier."
virgo,2015-03-12,"An opportunity to express yourself creatively is slipping away now and there isn't much you can do about it. Although you may see signs of the end of the long winter freeze -- this is more about the end of a phase for you. However, nothing is gained if you try and push the river. You can't demand others to move faster than they are willing because it only increases the stress on everyone's minds. In fact, moving into the next cycle will only happen when you are ready, and not a moment sooner."
libra,2015-03-12,"Confronting the widening gulf between your thoughts and feelings grows more pressing as the day unfolds. These internal conversations don't require another person; they occur naturally now as you continue to observe the conflict between two active voices. Of course, you may inadvertently project your dilemma outwardly onto a relationship if you think denial is a viable strategy. Even in your interactions with other people, steer clear of situations that require you to stay strictly in the logical and rational realms. Lead with your heart and don't look back."
scorpio,2015-03-12,"You may be feeling restless, eager to act out on the aggressive side of the equation today. The truth is that your unexpressed fears could make the current situation even more complicated. But you are growing weary from what might seem like a fight for your life. However, it's time to salve any open wounds and consciously begin to slow down your emotional roller-coaster. Whether it's apparent or not, you are the one in charge of this ride."
sagittarius,2015-03-12,"There are emotional issues that have been stewing for the past few days, yet you appear to be finally passing through the eye of the storm. Perhaps you are still being battered by the winds, but it's nearly impossible to know for sure which direction you will be facing once the dust settles. Whatever you do, stay focused on the horizon now. Your persistence pays off if you hang in for the long haul. However, if you do lose patience, a minor meltdown can be extremely cathartic today as long as you know when to call it quits."
capricorn,2015-03-12,"You could unknowingly drive an emotional wedge between you and someone at work today. It really doesn't matter how good your intentions are unless you continue to follow through with your efforts. However, you could make matters worse if you alienate others with your heightened sense of urgency. Don't push too hard toward achieving your goals in the real world. Acknowledging your desires doesn't guarantee success, but it's the first step to reducing the current stress. Sometimes people just want to be included in the process."
aquarius,2015-03-12,"The current confusion is finally morphing into a more stable situation. Your old spark has returned, so fire up your intellect and prepare for the show. Your day may be hijacked by heated conversations about your responsibilities or endless evaluations of your work habits. But avoid negotiations that require objective analysis, since it's difficult to separate your rational thoughts from your irrational needs today. Nevertheless, you can enjoy the lively dialogue once you gain a fresh perspective on your feelings."
pisces,2015-03-12,"You need to find an outlet for your current wanderlust or it might drive you to make a decision that undermines the gains you've already made. Luckily, you are a sight to behold once you have made up your mind. Ask your friends for guidance, but don't be afraid to trust your heart. Listen with your entire being and not just your head; your spirit already knows which adventure is best for your soul."
aries,2015-03-13,"Defending your ideas against someone with a different agenda than yours can turn into more of a debacle than you want. You just want to hold your ground, but could end up angering someone in the process. However, the emotional outburst may not be as intense as it appears at first. If you feel like you are being pushed to a breaking point, stop arguing and change your mindset instead. Thankfully, once you reclaim your center you won't need to fight for the approval of anyone else. Striving for self-sufficiency is what you Rams do best."
taurus,2015-03-13,"Your hopes for the future are fueled by idealistic fantasies today. Unfortunately, your reality doesn't necessarily support your inspirational dreams. Your work is cut out for you now because you must find a way to harmonize your desires with everyone else's, making it difficult to just follow your heart. Nevertheless, satisfaction isn't as elusive as it might seem. Hold your torch high and keep your eyes fixed on your long-term goals. Today's setbacks evolve into tomorrow's success stories."
gemini,2015-03-13,"Your greatest challenge today may involve choosing which tasks to complete and which ones to postpone for a later date. It isn't that you made too many promises; instead, it's others who are asking more of you than you can accomplish at this time. In fact, noisy Mercury could overwhelm you with too much information now. Do whatever you can to help, but don't be concerned about someone else's judgment once you have established your limits. Setting healthy boundaries enables you to do your best work."
cancer,2015-03-13,"You might have made a commitment that's weighing heavily on your mind now, and there appears to be little you can do to prevent someone's disappointment. Don't waste energy doubting yourself as you contemplate your next move. The current stress isn't meant to point out your weaknesses; its real purpose is to highlight how much you already have on your plate. Rely on your good intentions and emotional fortitude to navigate these confusing times. Changing your attitude is an act of free will and is the first step toward improving your circumstances."
leo,2015-03-13,"Staying in touch with your inner spirit takes extra concentration when you're feeling stressed. Fortunately, you have a deep reservoir of determination and resolve. However, others seem to thwart your efforts, regardless of your tactics. Attempting to undermine someone's authority won't help your cause now, since this strategy only impedes your forward movement. Instead, graciously acknowledge whoever is in control and then get on with the business at hand. Dazzle your adversaries with your kindness and your competence."
virgo,2015-03-13,"You're stuck between two uncontrollable forces without an apparent way out today as clever Mercury locks horns with unpredictable Uranus and unrelenting Pluto. Unfortunately, the more you struggle, the worse it gets. Instead of trying to escape, stick around and learn the truth, even if you think it could be unpleasant. Your willingness to uncover the facts now will steadily resolve the tension over the days ahead. Perseverance is your friend."
libra,2015-03-13,"Someone's hidden motives come to light now, adding to the stress between you and others. Your coworkers might not like what they learn today, but the awkward energy should begin to shift once the truth is revealed. Whatever the disagreements of perspective, common ground can be established, even if it takes more time than you prefer. Have patience; the process of healing works best on its own timetable. All you can do is make it clear that your intentions are pure and you're more than willing to do your part to move forward."
scorpio,2015-03-13,"You are usually up for a good challenge when you know that you're doing the right thing. But now as communicator Mercury aggravates your key planet Pluto, make sure that you're not being played as a pawn in someone else's game. If you think that you are being manipulated today, step back from the struggle and reconsider your options. Temporarily disengaging from the dynamics of the current situation allows you to detach from your feelings long enough to make the most logical decision."
sagittarius,2015-03-13,"You might secretly believe you're fighting for a losing cause today, but holding firm to your fading optimism may still be the best thing you can do. If you begin questioning your long-term goals now, you could start a spiral downward into worry or despair. Stay aware of what's going on, but don't focus on the dark side or it will be impossible to be productive. There is a silver lining to the rain cloud that is yours to discover if you keep an open mind and a receptive heart."
capricorn,2015-03-13,"You are feeling extremely passionate about your life now and are eager to work hard just to keep all the balls up in the air. However, this isn't the best time to start a new venture, since loose ends may fray faster than you can tie them back together. Remain focused on your goals with a singular purpose, even if you feel overwhelmed in the present moment. The positive impact of your current efforts will be seen as early as next week. Keep the faith; the rainbow is closer than you think."
aquarius,2015-03-13,"Your nerves are on edge today, making it nearly impossible to complete what you start because you can't concentrate. Your current impatience prompts you to talk before your thoughts are fully developed as cerebral Mercury anxiously aligns with unorthodox Uranus. Unfortunately, your radical thinking may upset your colleagues now, so it's wise to consider other people's feelings before saying too much. Using your common sense helps you avoid unnecessary confrontations with those who would make better allies than enemies."
pisces,2015-03-13,"Uncertainty rises from the hidden depths of your subconscious and your initial impulse may be to clamp down on your fantasies and become uncharacteristically rigid now. Unfortunately, your inflexibility won't help you manage the stresses of the day. However, the pressure begins to abate when you accept that you don't need to know where you are going just yet. Loosen your grip on reality today and your desired destination might magically appear closer than you expect."
aries,2015-03-14,"Although you have come to the conclusion that practicing patience is your smartest strategy now, you still might feel as if you're jumping out of your skin. You're enthusiastic about the future, yet you can't decide whether to laugh joyfully at the possibilities or scream out of frustration at the delays. Your coworkers might be concerned about your erratic behavior, but their worries will likely turn into respect as you pick up steam over the next several weeks. Have faith; your time will come."
taurus,2015-03-14,You might appear somewhat subdued today as you settle into a steady pace and go about your chores. You're not concerned about receiving recognition for your individual contribution now; you're more driven just to get things done right. Your friends and relatives see you as a real team player because you're happy to trade anonymity for the overall success of a group project. The joy of sharing in a common goal is worth the personal sacrifice.
gemini,2015-03-14,"You wish that being observed by others didn't make you feel uncomfortable today. You might think that you would be happier once you escape public scrutiny. Whatever you do, you seem to garner more than your fair share of attention now; however, you might end up growing more accustomed to the spotlight as the day wears on. Unfortunately, your dramatic performance could make someone uneasy. Thankfully, you can play a starring role in the current project and still share the recognition with your coworkers so that everyone feels appreciated."
cancer,2015-03-14,"Following the rules might not make sense to you now, but it still isn't advisable to bite the hand that feeds you. Be respectful and work within the existing constraints even if they seem illogical. You can always question authority later, especially since rebellious behavior today won't likely make you any friends or influence those who matter. Think twice about your message before you say anything; even a minor slip of the tongue can start a verbal battle that you would be wise to avoid. If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
leo,2015-03-14,"You probably know better, but it's so tempting to say what's on your mind today if you think you can balance the score by uttering a few clever words at exactly the right time. However, you might believe that some things are better left unsaid. Don't waste energy by holding a grudge if you have unexpressed anger that needs venting. Just remember to be kind in your delivery. Steering clear of blaming anyone else for your feelings garners you more support than you expect."
virgo,2015-03-14,"You are usually quite rational in your approach to solving problems; however, a friend or partner could confuse you with their stories, even if you think your logic is sound. At first, you may doubt your ability to accurately interpret what you hear, but as you listen further you realize that you aren't the cause of the current misunderstanding. Nevertheless, don't wait until you are trapped by an emotional drama; avoid conflict, even if it means walking away without resolution."
libra,2015-03-14,"You may be at odds with someone today, and you don't understand how the warm and fuzzy feelings could have cooled off so quickly. Thankfully, a lover's quarrel or a business conflict won't last long if you can maintain mutual respect, no matter how strongly you disagree. But don't force the issue now because tempers might flare without warning. Instead, return to the discussion next week after everyone's emotions have settled down. Focusing on the strengths of a relationship helps to retain the magic."
scorpio,2015-03-14,"A heated debate with an acquaintance can rattle your nerves today and pull you off track. Although you may be tempted to settle the score right away, it's impossible because there's actually no single correct answer. Fortunately, you're probably easily persuaded to accept the difference of opinions if you feel like your words are heard. Don't fight to win; just speak your piece as clearly as you can and give others the courtesy of doing the same. Take the high road and move on."
sagittarius,2015-03-14,"You may believe that cooling your jets now will help you stabilize your position with someone you like, but the idea of new projects at home spark your interest before you slow down enough to matter. If you are wise, you won't take off with an intriguing idea until you give it plenty of time to develop. However, you could become obsessed with your scheme and try to launch it prematurely. Downplay your plans until next week after you've had a chance to perform due diligence. Haste makes waste."
capricorn,2015-03-14,"You might decide that being patient is more prudent than climbing mountains today, trying to achieve impossible results. You could exhaust yourself if you attempt to force a river to flow uphill now that the Moon has returned to your ambitious sign. But it's pointless to fight the inevitable, even if you feel the need to stand your ground. Bide your time and wait until the cosmic energy shifts in your direction. In the meantime, concentrate on completing any unfinished business so you are ready to jump when the time is right."
aquarius,2015-03-14,"Oddly, you are more certain about your feelings today, even if a close friend or relative thinks you're barking up the wrong tree. Luckily, you're wise enough to recognize that there can be differing methods to successfully handle the same issue. Establish common ground and then agree to disagree on the specifics. Rather than arguing about the divergent approaches, focus on your similar values and build from there."
pisces,2015-03-14,"Although you're in an agreeable state of mind today, a conflict could erupt if you say more than is necessary. Ironically, your attempts to avoid an argument only seem to agitate it. Unfortunately, you may be more confused about an important issue than you realize, and your lack of clarity fogs your communication now. If you're not one hundred percent positive, simply admit it; being transparent prevents headaches and invites intimacy."
aries,2015-03-15,"You may think you're being unfairly attacked today by someone who is simply trying to improve your overall efficiency. But don't overreact by compromising too quickly and changing your behavior to accommodate others. There's no need to pretend you're willing to alter your approach just to avoid a confrontation. Thankfully, you will be less likely to provoke trouble now if you're honest about your motives right from the beginning. Ultimately, it's in your best interest to give others the benefit of the doubt."
taurus,2015-03-15,"Although your desires may conflict with someone else's today, the disagreements will probably be minor ones. Still, there's no reason to feed the fire with your insecurities. Instead, make use of the strategic Capricorn Moon's intention to plant your best thoughts, and then nurture them until they slowly take root for future growth. You might think that you have to disclose all your ideas now, but this assumption can complicate matters even more. Patience is one of your innate virtues, so slow down and let everything unfold organically."
gemini,2015-03-15,"You're usually at the top of your game when your world is buzzing with so much mental stimulation. However, you're so exuberant today that you may blurt out something that's better kept to yourself. You intuitively understand that your plans could change several times before the day is done, but you might forget about where you are in the process. Practicing meditation or deep breathing enables you to settle your busy mind. Taking the time to calm your nerves helps you avoid moments of regret."
cancer,2015-03-15,"Someone may share an ingenious idea today that sounds totally sensible, but it just won't fit into your tight schedule. Unfortunately, analyzing all the facts again might not help your decision process. You could listen to other people's stories all day long while still resisting to help them out. Or you can just jump in with an open heart, even if it means putting your own issues on the back burner. Go for the assist; it won't be as time consuming as you think and the intangible rewards make it worthwhile."
leo,2015-03-15,"You may be struck with the lightning of awareness today, but you must make the effort to follow through and do something with your brilliant idea. This arrangement seems fair, but if someone else suggests another plan, why are you still the one who has more work to do? Unfortunately, changing these inequitable dynamics appears to be beyond your reach. Although you want more control of your own life, it's wise to do what's expected of you now. You'll have a chance to put things back in balance soon enough when the spotlight is back on you."
virgo,2015-03-15,"You are grateful that you have your common sense to fall back on today because without it you might be swept up by every idea that comes down the road. Although one part of you is bored with your regular routine now, you might not be ready to break free just yet. Others are counting on your stability, so bolting isn't necessarily an appropriate move. Hold on to your horses; choosing the right time to initiate decisive action bodes well for your success."
libra,2015-03-15,"Understanding how your fears influence your judgments isn't an easy task, yet this inner emotional journey can push you toward making one decision or another. Keep in mind that your integrity is more important than what anyone thinks of you. Don't let your own intellectual noise lure you off track. Believe it or not, your thoughts pick up speed over the days ahead, making it harder to reclaim your peace of mind. Make the most of this moment while you have the chance."
scorpio,2015-03-15,"You have set your heart on a much bigger prize today -- an emotional treasure buried deep beneath the observable surface. A minor irritation can provoke you to withdraw and escape into your imagination, but turning inward now may stir old fears that impede your progress. Unquestionably, it's better to deal directly with an annoyance before it morphs into something larger that becomes untenable, adding another detour to your important search. A stitch in time saves nine."
sagittarius,2015-03-15,"Use your authority as effectively as you can today by sharing your real-world experiences instead of just trying to boss others around. You have recently returned back to reality from a trip to the outer limits of possibilities. Luckily, you can again hear the voice of common sense, even though it clips your wings in the process. Keep both feet on the ground until you see tangible results from your heartfelt efforts. Leading by example is your key to success."
capricorn,2015-03-15,"Although you might believe that time is running out, the game is far from over. Don't trust your senses today because a trick of light warps your perceptions to match your unexpressed desires. There is a lot more going on than meets the eye as the evocative Moon and secretive Pluto in your sign remind you that simple logic won't necessarily override your passion. Denial isn't a viable strategy, so keep an open mind until your head and your heart are in agreement."
aquarius,2015-03-15,"You don't want anyone to notice how serious you feel today because you believe their assumptions could paint you into a corner. You are scared of being stuck in a role you don't want to play. Reassessing your options is advisable while mischievous Mercury squares heavy-hitter Saturn over the next couple of days, throwing a few unexpected curve balls your way. Don't be overly concerned about the opinions of anyone else; the only expectations you need to conform to are your own."
pisces,2015-03-15,"You could willingly play the part of the conscientious person who honors everyone's interests today, even if you sacrifice your own point of view in the process. The responsible Capricorn Moon's visit to your 11th House of Teamwork enables you to keep your preferences to yourself in the name of community spirit. Just remember that your feelings are important as well, even if they are temporarily subsumed by the needs of the larger group. Fortunately, you don't have to lose your individuality to be an integral member of the tribe."
aries,2015-03-16,"Frustration arises as your most ingenious ideas meet the stone cold reality of unchangeable circumstances today. However, facing insurmountable resistance might not be enough to stop you from trying to get your way anyhow. The lesson you need to learn now is critical, even if you don't want to hear it. Your point of view isn't the only one that matters. Be open to the feedback you receive and incorporate other people's perspectives into your own. Being brilliant is easy if you take the time to listen."
taurus,2015-03-16,"A communication problem comes back to haunt you today, especially if it escalates into a major disagreement. In fact, this could be such a drawn-out power struggle that you might need to retreat to gather your thoughts. You won't likely find a quick solution, but your dogged persistence may win your opponent over in the end. The right amount of stubbornness can be just what the doctor ordered. But you must know when to call it quits if you really want to move forward."
gemini,2015-03-16,"Your life takes a definite turn for the better, but not until you first face a problem or two that might take the wind out of your sails. You may not normally be so serious, but you're not likely to be happy-go-lucky when you're struggling with obstacles that you have set in your own path. Stick to the facts today without assuming the worst. But be willing to step into unexplored areas on the map to gain the most from this tumultuous cosmic storm."
cancer,2015-03-16,"Being satisfied with your current circumstances might endow you with a somewhat lazy attitude early in the day. Nevertheless, a little restlessness could be a strong motivational factor by the afternoon. Even if you don't think you're ready to embark on an adventure to the unknown, at least you can be the one who stirs up a bit of excitement at home. Anything that catalyzes a larger shift helps you gain a renewed passion for life."
leo,2015-03-16,"You may feel as if your life is separated into two opposite parts today. The first piece of the puzzle can be rather serious as you deal with a difficult situation at work. Others might see you as a stick-in-the-mud now, but you're not ready to surrender your position, however unpopular. Luckily, the other part comes into play if you maintain your integrity and pass this test of character with flying colors. The joy in your personal life is more than enough of a reward for your extraordinary efforts."
virgo,2015-03-16,"The real world impinges upon your fantasy life today, forcing you to rein in your imagination. However, cerebral Mercury won't leave you alone with your thoughts, making it twice as hard to follow your heart. Your inner voice judges nearly everything you think now, making it difficult to let your mind roam. But you might feel stuck, even when you try to stay on track. Ironically, accepting your own limitations empowers you to break free from the current restraints. Fly, baby, fly."
libra,2015-03-16,Steer clear of any friends who tell you what to do today because they can end up costing you valuable time and energy if you listen to them and ignore your own common sense. It's not that others are purposely misleading you; it's just that they don't understand your scheduling constraints. Your previous commitments are more extensive than anyone else realizes and how you manage your day has wider ramifications than the present moment. Set the tone for the future by establishing practical boundaries and adhering to them no matter what temptations you encounter.
scorpio,2015-03-16,"Although it seems as if your choices are limited today, you can still make the most of the present moment if you're willing to adjust your expectations as you go along. But you may be in a weird mood because you don't know whether you can trust your own instincts now. In theory, it's safer to rely on the facts until your intensity settles back down. However, in practice, you might not be able to wait. Make a list of all your options along with the pros and cons of each before making any drastic moves you regret."
sagittarius,2015-03-16,"There are so many creative ideas you want to pursue these days, it's nearly impossible to contain your exuberance. Unfortunately, you can't follow every road just because it might lead to another rainbow. Rather than attempting to fit everything into your tight schedule, be flexible about what you include. Although you can't control all the variables at play, conserving your energy today increases your chances for long-term success. Powerful cosmic dynamics are at work now, so willingly go with the flow instead of fighting it."
capricorn,2015-03-16,"Thankfully, you won't have to spend the day playing catch-up if you've been doing your job all along like a responsible Capricorn. Instead, you can finish your obligations pretty quickly today and then have the chance to dive into something new. However, you might not feel free to do exactly what you want. If an emotional issue surfaces with a family member now, take the time to resolve it thoroughly before moving on. A closer connection is possible if your intentions are pure and your conscience is clear."
aquarius,2015-03-16,"When friends and peers expect you to do something in particular, you often rebel. You prefer doing things your own way in your own time. However, you may not have an opportunity to choose today. You can work yourself into a state of frustration by resisting other people's demands. Nevertheless, it's much easier to just do what you should so you're free later to do whatever you wish. A little cooperation goes a long way toward cultivating an atmosphere of mutual respect and trust."
pisces,2015-03-16,"It's time to take your work to the next level, no matter how much you have already accomplished. Unfortunately, you can't just wish your way up the ladder of success. You must be persistent while demonstrating your competence. But if you do encounter an insurmountable problem, just view it as a sign that you must make a fundamental change to your current strategy before proceeding further. It's much more effective to have your ducks in a row prior to attempting to manifest your dreams."
aries,2015-03-17,"You currently like the idea of having a few days to chill out, but might be surprised at how quickly you get bored with nothing to do. Or, you may need to face the reality that rest and relaxation are harder to come by than you imagined. Nevertheless, aggravation won't have a chance to take root if you're willing to accept things as they are, rather than as you wish. Honestly, it's not so much about what happens to you; your true test of character is determined by how you respond."
taurus,2015-03-17,"An old familiar memory rushes back into your thoughts today. But rather than feeling nostalgic, you can see glaring similarities mirrored in your current life. It's comforting to know that you can recreate a sweet feeling from the past without losing touch of the present. But don't fall into the trap of expecting the outcome to be the same. Although your flexibility is refreshing, your willingness to be surprised is your ticket to true satisfaction."
gemini,2015-03-17,"You might suddenly realize today that your life trajectory isn't going to change as fast as you had hoped. It might be rather jarring to have your expectations dashed, but it's crucial to understand that bigger issues are still in play. Fortunately, reality is not as set in stone as you think. You don't need to reinvent your plans or redefine your goals; you only have to revise your schedule, giving the transformation more time to come to fruition. Today's failure leads to tomorrow's success."
cancer,2015-03-17,"Everything boils down to adopting the proper perspective today, especially if you are feeling like you're not making enough progress in your career. Oddly enough, you're able to maintain your optimism, even if one thing after another seems to slow you down. If you have recently changed directions, hold to your new course. If you haven't yet put your ideas into motion, it's time to take initiative and make something happen. But don't think the current situation is all-important; it's just another step on your amazing journey to realize your potential."
leo,2015-03-17,"The good news is that you are on the receiving end of more encouragement now than you dreamed possible. However, the bad news is everyone seems to have an agenda that's different from yours. You would love to embrace their support, but you don't want to alter your plans for any reason. Although there's no quick solution to this dilemma, it's best to graciously accept the assistance rather than to fearfully push it away. Thankfully, the full story will come out sooner than you expect, clearing the air once and for all."
virgo,2015-03-17,"You begin to see the possibilities ahead through a wide-angle lens today. Happily, this is not pie-in-the-sky dreaming, for your practical approach to planning keeps you on a straight and narrow path. Nevertheless, you might have trouble regaining your center because you are willing to entertain a variety of options to carry you into the future. Although this ambiguity is unsettling to you discriminating Virgos, don't make any definitive choices too quickly. The longer you can sustain multiple scenarios, the more satisfied you will be with the final outcome."
libra,2015-03-17,"Although relationship dynamics might be more complicated than ever, you have a particular goal in mind and are confident you will reach it one way or another. If fact, you may be feeling more certain about a recent decision, but your current optimism can backfire on you if it prevents you from seeing things in their true light. Proceed carefully when separating your fantasies from reality. Dreaming big is a wonderful exercise as long as you keep your feet on the ground."
scorpio,2015-03-17,"You can rely on your closest friends to come through with flying colors on your behalf now. However, you may need to ask for what you want, even if you think that someone close to you should be able to decipher your thoughts. But the practical side of communication shatters this mind-reading myth. Take the guesswork out of the picture by being as precise as possible. The more specific you are in your disclosure, the better your chances of feeling fulfilled at the end of the day."
sagittarius,2015-03-17,"Your work routine carries an uncharacteristic appeal these days. Perhaps the regularity with which you do your tasks is simply reassuring. Or maybe you're just thankful that you have something productive to do now. Eliminating bad habits and improving your lifestyle adds more stability to your life. Not only will you feel rejuvenated once you upgrade your daily regimen, you will be better equipped to make the most of the days ahead."
capricorn,2015-03-17,"The innocent side of love is captivating to you these days. Although you are ready to reduce the complexity of your life, downsizing is more challenging than it sounds. Nevertheless, walking away from a stressful situation might be part of the larger plan. But this is not the time for a Houdini-like disappearing act; instead, you are learning the subtleties of patience. Romance need not be a house of cards held up by fantasy; a down-to-earth approach to love is more likely to result in a happy heart."
aquarius,2015-03-17,"You may be more of a homebody these days -- at least that's how it appears to everyone else. But even if you enjoy the idea of retreating into your private world, you probably won't be able to pull it off for long. There is too much going on in your personal life now to disappoint your best allies. Show up and express your gratitude for those who only wish you the best. The real treasures in your life are your friends."
pisces,2015-03-17,"You feel more emotionally secure now if you're living life to your fullest potential. Obviously, your sense of independence is not subservient to anyone else's, especially when the stakes are so high. You know exactly what you want and possess an uncharacteristic unwavering determination to own it. You won't be swayed from your course today, even if your goals are not concrete yet. Give your dreams time to develop as they will continue to evolve in the weeks ahead. In the meantime, count your blessings along the way."
aries,2015-03-18,"Pay attention to every single thought today because nearly every hope and dream you visualize has the potential of actually coming true. Although this sounds like wonderful news, it's possible to squander these auspicious times on transient pleasures. Instead of seeking satisfaction only through your senses, raise the stakes by including someone you love to share in your good fortune. For it is in giving that one receives the most."
taurus,2015-03-18,"Think twice or even three times about what you want to divulge to your friends today because they are diligently listening to every word you say. You may not realize how significant your ideas are now, but your message can be quite inspiring to those who hear it. Nevertheless, being practical isn't your main concern now. Your current role is to assist others by dreaming out loud as colorfully as possible. If you take a risk and reach for the stars, a loved one might just follow."
gemini,2015-03-18,"Being confined by your job is definitely no fun, since your creativity is soaring to new heights now. Even if you can focus on your work for short periods of time, it's tough staying on a straight and narrow path. It's much more enjoyable to meander through your fantasies than to concentrate on your chores. Nevertheless, don't be too concerned if you aren't very productive today. Entertaining as many possibilities as you can feeds your imagination from all angles."
cancer,2015-03-18,"You may be quite pleased with yourself if you find time to sneak off and daydream today. You're enchanted with all the messages that you receive from the depths of your subconscious, but it's confusing if the veil between reality and fantasy grows too thin. Fortunately, there's no need for worry now; your intuition won't let you down as long as you're willing to leave on a magic carpet ride without yet knowing your destination. Embrace the unknown."
leo,2015-03-18,"It's nearly impossible to be sure if you're growing closer to someone special or if the entire relationship is a figment of your imagination. Although the dividing line between fact and illusion is blurry today, you still want to know the truth. However, it might not be such a bright idea to push too fast or you could upset the magical balance. Instead, be joyful in the present moment because today's positive attitude improves the dynamics of tomorrow."
virgo,2015-03-18,"It seems as if everyone except you is living in a dream world now that rational Mercury dances with surreal Neptune in your 7th House of Others. However, it's crucial to consider your contribution to encouraging the fantasy, even if you believe someone is misleading you today. Seek the deeper lesson in this spiritual experience rather than fretting over what could go wrong. When you recognize the recurring patterns in your life, you have a better chance of being free from falling victim to your own emotional trap."
libra,2015-03-18,"You may not have a very clear self-image today, especially if you're experiencing any physical symptoms that elude diagnosis. You might be so hypersensitive now that subtle stresses in a relationship could manifest as pain. Don't ignore the discomfort; finding its source enables you to eliminate it. Once you acknowledge the reality of the situation and engage in honest communication, it's easier to relax and connect with someone in a more meaningful manner."
scorpio,2015-03-18,"You could be setting yourself up for disappointment today by idealizing romance. It's all too easy to be blinded by your own fantasies with the Moon, Mercury and Neptune brilliantly lighting up your 5th House of Love and Play. You may even temporarily lose touch with reality. However, facing the truth highlights your innate ability to see beauty where someone else would be distracted by the imperfections. Just recognizing the potential for magic without blowing it out of proportion might be enough for now."
sagittarius,2015-03-18,"You can't help but look at a family situation through rose-colored glasses today, making it tricky to discern the reality of what's going on. It's difficult to separate the current circumstances from similar events in the past, but it's critical to draw the distinctions between then and now in order to clarify your perceptions. Seeing the truth exactly as it is in the present moment is the first step toward resolution. Changing awareness is the key to changing everything else."
capricorn,2015-03-18,"You can sidestep trouble today by going out of your way to honor all of your commitments. Although it's not your usual pattern, you might miss an appointment or forget to return a call. Unfortunately, it's the simplest misunderstandings that play havoc with your day. Take time to manage your schedule now before it runs away from you. Thankfully, a sincere apology is all it takes to make things right. Your reputation for reliability precedes you, so others will give you the benefit of the doubt."
aquarius,2015-03-18,"A minor glitch in your personal finances could cause major annoyance today and avoiding the issue only makes it worse. Fortunately, a simple solution is possible now if you are willing to think outside of the box. But don't hide your head in the sand. Taking responsibility for the problem is your only viable course of action, whether the situation was created by a judgment error or just an unexpected expense. Clean up your mistake before it turns into a mess."
pisces,2015-03-18,"You may choose to spend your day playing in Fantasyland while trickster Mercury hooks up with nebulous Neptune, bending your perceptions out of shape. This may be a mixed blessing, but your logic isn't limited by reality now. Instead, your current thinking is colored by your subconscious desires. Although this surreal feeling makes it even harder to wend your way through the real world, it also bestows upon you the ability to enchant others with your words. Use your magical powers to spread love and hope in a world that needs both more than ever."
aries,2015-03-19,"Unrealistic fantasies spin out of control today as the Moon agitates your 12th House of Imagination. As much as you try to focus on all of your responsibilities, some of them may have to wait for another day to be fulfilled. You wish you could just continue living in your dream world now, although you will likely pay the price for your escapist behavior. Instead of wasting your time and complaining about how much there is to do, just finish your chores quickly so you can return to your reverie as soon as possible."
taurus,2015-03-19,"You can amaze yourself in a blink of an eye today by remembering something about a dream of the future that's been eluding you. It's as if you found a missing clue without even searching for it. Your new point of view will probably still go through some ups and downs as your strategy continues to develop. Be prepared for your elation to fade into disappointment once you realize how much hard work is in front of you. Nevertheless, your enthusiasm returns once you start to see that you're making solid progress toward reaching your goals."
gemini,2015-03-19,"Your desire for freedom on the job now may be exacerbated by previously made promises, placing you in the middle of a dilemma of your own making. Of course, you want to take care of your personal obligations, even if heading out into the big wide world sounds more exciting. Don't run away just because the grass looks greener on the next hill. Remember that your newly found independence won't mean as much unless you also maintain the peace at home."
cancer,2015-03-19,"You may be lost in your fantasies as you embark on an incredible inner adventure today. You could grow so confident that you actually believe that anything is possible now. Unfortunately, something unexpected might happen to remind you that you're not as free as you think. Don't wallow in your own discouragement. Scale back your vision just a notch instead of setting off in search of the impossible dream. Small steps lead to success."
leo,2015-03-19,"Relationship stress might build to a crescendo today, especially if your friend or partner loses his or her temper. Something may be said that surprises you, but being caught off guard isn't the real problem. Even if you think the interpersonal dynamics are stable, you suddenly realize that you weren't looking very deep beneath the surface. Don't let your narrow vision trick you into missing the big picture. Keep in mind that taking everyone's perspectives into consideration now is better than being forced to negotiate later on. Resolution is possible if you strive to establish common ground and ask others to do the same."
virgo,2015-03-19,"You feel as if others can't be trusted today because they just don't seem to care as much about integrity as you do. You aren't easy to please, especially if your expectations are unrealistic; nevertheless, you don't think your ideas are all that extreme now. Allowing for someone else's shortcomings helps everyone to relax. Ironically, this simple act of generosity can improve the overall quality of all your relationships."
libra,2015-03-19,"A shocking bolt of lightning-like awareness may require you to abandon your previous plans. The current flow of events might not make as much sense once the circumstances begin to change. If you are willing to let your schedule fall apart, a sequence of events can be put into play quickly, allowing you to move forward with your new agenda sooner than you expect. Setting clear priorities helps you reclaim your center and refine your strategy."
scorpio,2015-03-19,"Taking an emotional risk and revealing what's in your heart can raise your anxiety to an uncomfortable level. However, the potential romantic or creative rewards could make your vulnerability more than worthwhile. The Moon's activity in your 5th House of Play suggests that a little fun is in order today. Pushing past your regular limits brings uncommon enjoyment as long as you remember to come back down to earth when reality calls."
sagittarius,2015-03-19,"You are controlled enough on the outside to fool everyone else into believing that you are unflappable now. However, denying your true feelings can backfire as a sudden bout of fearful self-restraint makes you appear less authentic than usual today. Expressing a little uncertainty works in your favor by reminding your friends that you are human, too. Others don't know you need help unless you ask. You might be surprised at who rides to your rescue if you are willing to be honest."
capricorn,2015-03-19,"Your life seems to be working out just as it should now, but for some unknown reason you still secretly wonder if everything is going to be okay in the long run. This odd juxtaposition tells a story of what can happen if you hide your feelings from those you love. Even if you have a clear view of your path ahead, sometimes it's hard to know the best way to reach your destination. Don't let go of your vision of the future. Focusing on your goals enables you to find your way when you feel overwhelmed. Sharing a burden makes it lighter to bear."
aquarius,2015-03-19,"Life may feel somewhat unstable today as your self-esteem soars one moment and then dips the next. It's nearly impossible to find solid ground on which to plant your feet, even if you want to build a strong foundation of security now. Obviously, this is a time of great transition. Don't try to play it safe by standing in one spot; you'll be happier if you can just float along with your mood swings until they begin to settle on their own. Once your logic returns, you will know what move to make next."
pisces,2015-03-19,"The lingering uncertainties make decision-making extraordinarily challenging these days. You're under pressure to shift your perspective or invent a new plan, but you are more comfortable now when maintaining the status quo. Don't worry if someone demands that you declare your intentions today; it's not prudent to say more than you know. Stick to your truth and make your choice known only once you are ready. Take whatever time you need to unravel the mysteries of your heart."
aries,2015-03-20,"It's as if you have just arrived at a four-star restaurant a few minutes before closing time, anticipating to sit down to a five-course meal. You might be served whatever you wish, yet your bad timing leaves an unpleasant taste in your mouth. The Pisces New Moon Eclipse occurs in your 12th House of Endings today, so release your feelings of guilt and just enjoy yourself. Although it's up to others to let you know if you have overstepped their boundaries, you can prevent an embarrassing moment by thinking before you act unconsciously. Tread carefully in your pursuit of pleasure."
taurus,2015-03-20,"Motives are muddied by passion today, so don't assume that you know how others are feeling unless they explicitly tell you. The Pisces Solar Eclipse shakes up your 11th House of Friends, indicating it would be wise to closely examine your own shortcomings before taking your negativity out on anyone else. Reassessing your own goals and considering alternate strategies is more constructive than causing an unpleasant scene. Ultimately, no one other than you is responsible for your emotional response."
gemini,2015-03-20,"Your emotions may be out of whack now and they could precipitate an awkward situation at work unless you deal with your insecurities first. The Pisces Solar Eclipse rattles your 10th House of Public Status; if you're worried about someone stealing your thunder, it's wise to react to reality instead of creating a problem before it manifests. If your efforts are being undermined, then it will be fully appropriate to take defensive action. Until such time, there's no reason to stress about things that might never happen, anyway. Shine your light for the world to see and the rest will fall into place."
cancer,2015-03-20,"It may seem rather hopeless today to plan for your adventure when you still have so much work on your plate. You would rather be making long-term plans now that the Pisces New Moon Eclipse activates your 9th House of Future Vision. Unfortunately, there are too many chores to finish in the present moment. If you are feeling overwhelmed, don't attempt to do everything at once. There's no room for discouragement if you narrow your focus and complete just a few things well. Be kind to everyone, especially yourself."
leo,2015-03-20,"Even if you aren't the overly jealous type, someone's actions could make you turn green with envy today as the Pisces Solar Eclipse polarizes your 8th House of Intimacy. Of course, emotional possessiveness won't lead anywhere worthwhile, but knowing that it's unproductive won't necessarily change your feelings in the moment. Don't get stuck in an unbreakable cycle; relinquishing control might just be the most reliable path to happiness. Trust is the hardest thing to find and the easiest to lose."
virgo,2015-03-20,"Someone's emotional disclosure can be rather upsetting to you today, especially if you feel even partially responsible for the current instability in your relationship. However, it's crucial to separate your compassion for someone you love from your desire to fix what's wrong as the Pisces Solar Eclipse triggers your 7th House of Partnerships. However, simply listening and acknowledging what you hear might be the kindest thing you can do now. Remember, you cannot change anyone's reactions but your own."
libra,2015-03-20,"Although you have many things to do today, you lack clear direction in setting your priorities. It's even more challenging than usual to make up your mind with the dreamy Pisces New Moon Eclipse dissipating the energy of your 6th House of Daily Routine. Nevertheless, you feel increasing pressure to make a choice as soon as possible. It may surprise you to realize that it doesn't matter where you start; just decide on a destination and begin. Thankfully, each step will become easier once you're in motion."
scorpio,2015-03-20,"You could be feeling quite satisfied with your life today, but more immediate concerns distract you from your desire for fun and games. You yearn to express yourself in spontaneous ways while the Pisces New Moon Eclipse mobilizes your 5th House of Creativity, but can't find the time to make your definitive statement. The real question isn't about what you should do; it's about what your heart wants. Color outside the lines and see what happens; play now and pay later."
sagittarius,2015-03-20,"Unsettling energy on the home front is not yet about to disappear as the Pisces New Moon Eclipse jars your 4th House of Security. You might be frustrated, yet you really don't know what to do about the current stressful dynamics. Perhaps it's time for you to accept that some things are beyond your control. Don't try to make everything better for everyone else just because you feel uncomfortable. Taking full responsibility for your own state of mind is your top priority. Your legendary optimism might be just what's needed to turn things around."
capricorn,2015-03-20,"You prefer having your day mapped out in detail, but your current schedule won't likely withstand the shifting pressures. Unfortunately, even your most sensible plans will be turned upside down today because the Pisces Solar Eclipse rocks your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Crossed messages may contribute to delays or even a cancellation of a scheduled event, prompting you to think deeply about how you spend your leisure time. Rolling with the unexpected waves of change allows you to turn any setback into an exciting opportunity."
aquarius,2015-03-20,"Current complications drive you to reconsider your old ways of managing your finances as today's Pisces New Moon Eclipse lands in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. On a deeper level, your relationship to money is likely tied to what you feel you deserve. If you are struggling with issues of self-acceptance now, a positive change in your attitude could directly impact your net worth. When you value your contribution with confidence, others will be more willing to pay you accordingly."
pisces,2015-03-20,"It's up to you to put closure around recent events so you are free to move on and embrace the future. The Pisces Solar Eclipse amplifies the cosmic energy in your 1st House of Self, marking an end to one significant phase of your life. Don't be afraid to feel the intensity of an emotional loss, especially if it helps you work through your unresolved issues. Remember, elimination is a necessary natural process that is required prior to renewal. A caterpillar must lose what it has to become a butterfly."
aries,2015-03-21,"Including people in your plans today is more complicated than it sounds because everyone has such a variety of individual needs. Four planets playing in your 1st House of Personality places you in the center of your own world. However, you may grow annoyed when others can't keep up with your frantic pace. Remember, you have an excess of energy now, but you can burn out just as easily as anyone else. Although conserving your resources doesn't come naturally, it creates greater harmony in your relationships."
taurus,2015-03-21,"You may be more excited about the prospects for the day than you let on. Others think you are willing to go along with the plans of the group, but you aren't as agreeable as everyone assumes. Don't just say yes to prevent an argument since taking the easy way out only fuels your resentment. Thankfully, there's no need to overstate your case, either. Just let everyone know your preferences and then act on your desires, even if it means striking out on your own. There' s no substitute for being true to yourself."
gemini,2015-03-21,"You are plugged into the bigger picture today and able to set aside your personal agenda for the good of the group. However, you may be so wired that you could blow your circuits by overdoing the social networking. Knowing when to acknowledge your limits requires vigilance, but you can establish clear boundaries if you put your mind to it. Balancing your needs with those of everyone else helps you maintain a healthy perspective throughout the day."
cancer,2015-03-21,"It's easy to forget about your shyness and set your caution aside today. You may be so passionate about your mission that you act first and worry about what you did later. Keep in mind that you don't have to take an all-or-nothing approach. It's wonderful to be so enthusiastic, but you have a better chance of achieving your goals if you don't lose your common sense. Count to ten before reacting impulsively, especially if it sounds like a too-good-to-be-true idea. Being spontaneous is one thing, being foolish is another."
leo,2015-03-21,"Blind optimism might run away with your day and lead you down an unproductive path. However, you don't want to spend so much time analyzing an opportunity that you lose the chance to have an amazing experience because of your inaction. This is dangerous territory because you are capable of imagining positive results wherever you look. Luckily, you can make your dreams come true if you simply take time to explore several options before choosing one. If you don't stretch a little further, you will never know how far you can go."
virgo,2015-03-21,"You may be conflicted about whether to join forces with others today or head off on your own. Several planets marching through pioneering Aries prompt you to take responsibility for your actions without necessarily involving anyone else. But this cosmic cluster lands in your 8th House of Joint Ventures, also encouraging you to share the workload and the rewards. There is no right or wrong answer to your current dilemma. If possible, hedging your bet is your most strategic move. Invite a partner to collaborate on your project, but be ready to do it alone at a moment's notice."
libra,2015-03-21,"You quickly grow tired of a friend or partner who seems to have a quick fix for everything today. Naturally, you appreciate other people's competence, but the speed at which they react doesn't leave you time to do your own reasoning. Your predicament is even more complicated if the advice you receive is useful. You don't want to overreact and throw the baby out with the bathwater, but neither do you want to let anyone else totally run your show. You may need to take a stand and set solid boundaries now. Fortunately, your diplomatic charm enables you to do it in a kind and supportive manner."
scorpio,2015-03-21,You're ready to take the bull by the horns and kick some butt today. You have an ambitious agenda and you're anxious to cross items off your to-do-list one at a time. Just make sure your expectations are in line with reality because it's just as easy to underestimate the resources needed to complete a job as it is to overestimate your capabilities. Being as realistic as possible when it comes to your goals allows you to accomplish enough to leave you feeling satisfied by the end of the day.
sagittarius,2015-03-21,"Surfing a creative high is exhilarating, but the exuberance can turn into discouragement if you harbor unrealistic expectations. If you're lucky enough to find that sweet spot and settle into a productive groove today, don't make the mistake of assuming it will last forever. Let the energy come and go on its own, like the rising and falling of the tides. Everything happens in a natural rhythm; if you don't try to control it, you can coexist in the enchantment of the cosmic flow."
capricorn,2015-03-21,"You're less interested in gaining recognition for your efforts today than you are in developing your potential. There is a deeper message that taskmaster Saturn is teaching you now and it's not about being admired or appreciated. In fact, you might be disappointed at first if your well-intended actions go unnoticed. Continue to do the best you can in all endeavors. Seeing your game improve is more rewarding now than anything else."
aquarius,2015-03-21,"You have a take-no-prisoners approach to your day with four planets in masterful Aries gathering in your 3rd House of Everyday Activities. You won't likely ask others what they want; you have an agenda and are willing to do nearly anything to accomplish your goals. It's admirable to be of such single purpose, but you could take this to an extreme now. Don't lose sight of the important relationships in your life. Tempering your ambitions for the sake of fostering friendships brings more satisfaction in the long run."
pisces,2015-03-21,"You might be so sure of yourself today that you forget about any lingering insecurities. In fact, a recent setback becomes less important as your perspective shifts to the sunny side of the street. Rather than feeling discouraged, recognize the current lessons as opportunities to improve your chances for success in the future. However, you can take this positive attitude too far by whitewashing a challenging situation. Don't just assume the best; be certain that your logic is sound prior to making any major life-altering decisions."
aries,2015-03-22,"You are determined to persuade others to join your cause today, but your rationalizations may be more about convincing yourself than anyone else. Consider what you could be taking for granted before announcing your intentions to the world. You might need to change your mind, even if you think you are right. It's crucial to establish an enduring foundation for your beliefs before you are too far along in your plans. Be sure of your facts before you put all your eggs in one basket."
taurus,2015-03-22,"You can't escape the pressure to change now, yet you grow stronger in your resolve by resisting specific points. You may believe that others are judging you unfairly, yet you seem to take it all in stride. However, you could grow weary from the stress because it feels like you must watch every single move you make. Try not to get too frustrated if your progress is stymied. It's better to take small steps than none at all."
gemini,2015-03-22,"The noise of your weekend routine begins to settle today, but even if you act as if you're fine, things may not be as pleasant as you prefer. You may feel restless because you want more variety and spice in your life. If your need for mental stimulation isn't being met, then something must give soon. Bide your time for a few more days; the energy will shift in a positive direction next week, offering you a perfect opportunity to make the changes you want."
cancer,2015-03-22,"Your emotions have been running hot and cold recently, challenging you to find a happy medium between the extremes. Even if you attempt to find solid middle ground today, it still may feel like you're bouncing back and forth between optimism and pessimism. Thankfully, the pragmatic Taurus Moon gives you the common sense to move beyond your clever words. Speaking from your heart doesn't have to be a scary endeavor. Remember, if you don't push so hard now, you won't have to retreat as far."
leo,2015-03-22,"Achieving your goals today is much more likely if you are realistic about them from the start. Fortunately, your concentration is unrelenting, and your unwavering determination takes you further than usual now, enabling you to make real progress on your path. Ultimately, there's no reason to pull any rabbits out of magical hats; you have an excellent chance to accomplish your objectives if you continue to stay in the practical lane with all of your thoughts and actions."
virgo,2015-03-22,"You might discover a way to embark on a special trip, an extended holiday or just a weekend adventure now with the Moon chilling out in your 9th House of Travel. Don't let this lovely chance pass you by without doing something about it. But if previous plans block your way, at least daydreaming about your vacation or sharing your vision is the next best thing you can do. Just bring an unconventional scheme out into the open, and the rewards might follow quicker than you expect. In an instant, you can go anywhere your imagination takes you."
libra,2015-03-22,"You could be drawn into someone's melodrama now before you even realize what happened. Although you likely have enough complications in your life, there may be a few more yet to handle. Even if there's a storm brewing around you, the good news is you're feeling more centered and comfortable with your decisions. Don't be tricked into thinking that you will lose your shot at success unless you act right away. Trust your intuition to lead you in the right direction."
scorpio,2015-03-22,"It's as if you're a team player in a relay race now, trying to maintain a steady but competitive pace. You have completed one lap, yet the next one hasn't yet started. If you aren't willing to relinquish the baton today, you will be stuck doing the same old thing over and over again. Fortunately, your teammates are more capable than you might think and handing off responsibilities to them is a winning strategy. You're not alone; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
sagittarius,2015-03-22,"Focusing on endless minutiae makes you restless as the earthy Taurus Moon joins Venus in your 6th House of Efficiency. However, unreasonable demands are being made on you to pay additional attention to things so tiny that you're sure there's a conspiracy afoot. You want to demonstrate how capable you are at managing the big picture and prefer to ignore the details. Balance is your key to success today, so keep one eye on the greater entity and the other on the specifics if you want to get the job done right."
capricorn,2015-03-22,"Endings and beginnings often arise together, but sometimes the timing is a bit off. Unfortunately, you may be eager to start a new project today, yet a separate set of obstacles prevents you from getting your plans off the ground. Instead of bolting ahead before you're truly ready, take the time to methodically finish up old business now so you are completely free to step into the new creative cycle next week. A clear slate gives you the best chance to shine in your next endeavor."
aquarius,2015-03-22,"Your attention is on domestic issues this weekend, and you're likely to spend more time at home and with your family. You might even get pulled into activities without being formally asked. Your boundaries aren't as clear as they often are, leaving you more susceptible today to the whims of those you love. Although you may not know exactly the best way to move forward, the wisdom will come to you just in the nick of time. Trust your heart for a change and see what happens."
pisces,2015-03-22,"You wish you didn't have any secrets to hide now because you dislike spending energy on trying to keep them under wraps. Whatever you are holding within your heart, it's time to open up and share your burden. Bask in the love, while remembering new potential for hurt arrives at the same time. Ultimately, you can make the best of a difficult situation if you're willing to express the wide range of feelings that you're experiencing. Your willingness to reveal your vulnerability inspires others to do the same."
aries,2015-03-23,"You're not a slave to logic today; no one will be able to talk you out of your plan if you want to do something. Nevertheless, you can be overly obstinate about an idea once you convince yourself that it's worth pursuing. Keep in mind that fantasy plays a role in your mental process today. Although dreaming can spur you on to greater heights, it can also lead you down a garden path. Remaining open to the feedback you receive from others can help you reach greater heights."
taurus,2015-03-23,"You may get off to a slow start today, making it tough to motivate yourself to keep up with your commitments. You have no problem visualizing the amazing things you could be doing, but your dreams won't manifest on their own. You might have to set aside concerns of comfort and be willing to work extra hard now. Although you are being asked to take on additional responsibilities, you will feel a high level of satisfaction if you have something positive to show for your efforts by the end of the day."
gemini,2015-03-23,"Your uncharacteristic need for peace and quiet may tempt you to withdraw from social interactions today, even if your friends want you to accompany them on a fun adventure. You're not willing to go along for the ride now, especially if you think the excitement will outweigh the serenity. Although you're usually eager to follow an unexpected course for a while, you aren't interested in wasting your energy now that you have your heart set on some downtime. Don't worry about other people's expectations; your heart knows what you need better than anyone else."
cancer,2015-03-23,"It's more productive to speak your mind after you formulate a sound plan today. Figuring out what you're going to say before sharing your thoughts with your friends or associates is your most effective strategy. Even though your dreams may fuel your heart's desires, it's healthier to choose the most viable fantasies and develop them into something tangible first. Others will be more likely to support your efforts if you take the time to bring your flights of fancy down to earth before expecting anyone else to rally to your cause."
leo,2015-03-23,"A coworker or friend may be exaggerating the truth today, but you will most likely take what you hear at face value. Your natural generosity of spirit enables you to give others the benefit of the doubt. Trusting someone else might initiate an emotional connection that adds value to your life. Although you must be ready to jump in with the right person when an opportunity is offered, make sure that you feel fully comfortable with the partnership before you invest your time and energy. Having your facts in place can make all the difference in the world."
virgo,2015-03-23,"You can grow obsessed with your plans for an upcoming adventure, and your natural powers of discrimination may fall to the wayside as you try to finalize your itinerary. Uncharacteristically, you might skim over the details and miss something important now as you justify what you want with opinions rather than facts. However, you won't find satisfaction if you reach the wrong destination in the process. Slow down and reconsider your current direction. Revamping your approach prevents you from running into obstacles down the road."
libra,2015-03-23,"You could be unconsciously holding out for a fairy tale to come true today. Unfortunately, an idyllic fantasy might not last long when confronted by reality. Although there may be opportunities for romance now, the easygoing Taurus Moon increases your need to keep things simple. You don't have to miss out on the fun, yet entertaining unrealistic hopes leads to disappointment. Your happiness depends upon finding that delicate balance between passionate explorations and lighthearted pleasures."
scorpio,2015-03-23,"Your favorite angle on personal satisfaction doesn't require approval from anyone else. Enjoying yourself is ultimately about your internal state of mind more than anything on the outside. Although your introspection can be productive now, retreating into your own world poses problems while the responsive Moon moves through your 7th House of Others. Be wary of buying into the beauty of someone else's dream today. Your current path is to follow your own."
sagittarius,2015-03-23,"You believe you have a healthy attitude about balancing work and play, but your responsibilities pile up very quickly today if you don't stay focused on them. Although sweet distractions can break your concentration, you are blessed with an extraordinary level of willpower now if you choose to use it. Don't be self-critical if you slip; just redirect your attention onto your current chores and keep moving forward one step at a time. Thankfully, you will be happily surprised with how much you actually accomplish when you wholeheartedly commit to fulfilling your promises."
capricorn,2015-03-23,"Many people mistakenly believe you Mountain Goats don't know how to have a good time. Happily, you can prove them wrong while the Moon dances in your 5th House of Spontaneous Pleasure. Nevertheless, this kind of self-indulgent thinking still leads to consequences later on if others are depending on you. Luckily, you're able to cover all your bases today. Don't ask for permission, but let someone know your plans so they don't feel like you're leaving them in the lurch. Just a few words ahead of time may be enough to allow you to make your escape with a clear conscience."
aquarius,2015-03-23,"Although you may be floating on a Neptunian cloud today, it's still a challenge to let go of your responsibilities, especially if your work directly impacts those around you. However, you don't have to succumb to anyone's arbitrary pressures and random deadlines. You can obtain great benefit from setting your regular routine aside for a while. The richness of the treasures you could discover while exploring your imagination will ultimately have a positive impact on you and everyone you touch. Dream first, act later."
pisces,2015-03-23,"You might feel burdened by your everyday chores, leading you to spend time dreaming of a different life. But breaking free from old habits might be tougher than it appears. Although the anticipation lures you into uncharted territory today, doing something contrary to the status quo can be a bit disconcerting. Instead of trying to escape from your situation, consciously alter your attitude first. Adopting a new awareness could gradually shift your experience out of a rut and into an entirely different direction."
aries,2015-03-24,"You may have a tough time concentrating on your work today because you're distracted by one interesting thing after another. For an instant everything seems clear, yet just a few moments later you're no longer sure what to do. Your current indecisiveness about how to approach the task at hand could create anxious feelings if you think that people are pressuring you to make a commitment. Thankfully, consciously postponing your final choice for a couple of days might be sufficient to help you coast through these tricky times."
taurus,2015-03-24,"Even if you want your life to settle down, something could happen to tilt the day in a different direction that doesn't conform to your agenda. Your initial reaction may be to try to gain control, but clinging to your previous schedule only increases your frustration. Instead, ease your grip and allow the instability to rattle on through. Don't act prematurely; reassert your will only once you have both feet back on solid ground."
gemini,2015-03-24,"Although you might go out of your way to seek thrills and chills today, you're tempted to withdraw from the action once it arrives at your door. You may have grown more accustomed to the peaceful atmosphere than you realize and start to miss it once the pace quickens. However, the needy Moon's visit to your sign encourages you to grasp for something that is just out of reach. Be appreciative for your current blessings since real satisfaction is only obtainable in the present moment. A grateful mind is a powerful mind."
cancer,2015-03-24,"You are not as calm on the inside as you seem on the outside today. People tend to see only your outer shell, preventing them from noticing your currently unsettled emotions. You may be nervous as you analyze whether or not something is important enough to fight for now. You have to choose between continuing on your way toward your previous destination and setting a new course. Even if you're uncertain, deciding one way or the other settles you emotion and frees you up so you can move forward."
leo,2015-03-24,"You think you are ready for nearly anything that might happen, but circumstances may not be as forgiving as you wish. Someone's unexpressed feelings could create a drag today, as if you're a boat pulling an anchor along behind it. Once you realize you can't find the source of the weight, your first impulse might be to get angry. Unfortunately, misplaced emotions won't help your cause. For now, take the course of least resistance. Going with the flow helps you to conserve your energy for when you take a stand later on."
virgo,2015-03-24,"Your power of analysis is inherently strong as long as you aren't overwhelmed by too many details. Unfortunately, you might find it difficult to follow through on anything you start today because it's challenging to navigate your way through the streams of incoming information. Thankfully, you don't have to obsess about filtering out all the irrelevant data. Simply work with what you know and concentrate on your goal until you achieve it."
libra,2015-03-24,"You may be relieved when you realize how many options are available today. Ironically, your newfound freedom of choice can stabilize your current situation because you don't feel as trapped as you once thought you were. Nevertheless, you really don't need to make any major decisions now. Keeping multiple paths open as long as possible enables you to be better informed about your alternatives before making a commitment."
scorpio,2015-03-24,"You're being challenged to relinquish your need for intensity today and, thankfully, you can appreciate the value of a more casual approach to life. Practicing flexibility allows you to go along with someone else's plan now, even if you believe yours is better. Just remember that acting in a halfhearted manner doesn't work for you all-or-nothing Scorpios. Anger or resentment could surface if you stubbornly hold on to your previous desires. Fortunately, being honest right from the start all but ensures a mutually beneficial outcome."
sagittarius,2015-03-24,"Someone could fly into your life today and have you chasing whimsical ideas as if they were the most important things in the world to you now. You're confident you can grab this lovely illusion and create something tangible from it, even if it's totally unrealistic. Unfortunately, you could waste too much energy running down a dream that isn't as enthralling once it's caught. Think twice before pursuing a fantasy you might soon regret."
capricorn,2015-03-24,"You have several intriguing ideas while at work today, but your mind is racing and you could be off to the next inspiring thought before you do anything with the current one. Unfortunately, a useful concept might get lost in the shuffle if you don't take the time to write it down as it's unfolding. You shouldn't rely on your memory if you want to retain something important. Building on a solid foundation requires a methodical approach and disciplined follow through."
aquarius,2015-03-24,"You are refreshed by incoming waves of enthusiasm, but new ideas that surface today might not be as viable as they seem at first. You may grow discouraged if you think your strategy is an intelligent one, only to see it quickly lose luster. Don't try to hold onto any one possibility above all the others; allow every thought to rise and fall in its own time. Ironically, remaining detached from the outcome gives you the best chance of manifesting your plan."
pisces,2015-03-24,"Trusting your natural psychic powers isn't easy today because your logic leads you to conclude something very different from your intuition. It doesn't matter how often you run through the individual steps in your mind; your rational analysis remains at odds with what's in your heart. Fortunately, you gain a wider perspective when you don't force conflicting points of view into a single answer. Integrating your feelings with the facts leads to success."
aries,2015-03-25,"The adrenaline is pumping through your body these days, but a twinge of intuition warns you not to make any sudden moves. Your natural inclination is to ignore the danger signs by closing your eyes and just jumping into the fray. Although red-hot Mars in fiery Aries tempts you to rush precariously close to the edge, sensible Saturn advises you to think things through one more time before going too far. Oddly enough, consciously exercising self-restraint today isn't as difficult as you might think and, thankfully, works in your favor."
taurus,2015-03-25,"Clever ideas rush into your awareness today, but there's no way to follow each one of them to its conclusion. Your most practical strategy is to narrow the field of possibilities prior to taking any decisive action. It's pointless to waste time switching focus from one task to another, even if each is worthwhile. As Einstein wisely said, ""ninety-nine percent of genius is knowing what's important."" There is a reliable path to success hidden in the noise; your assignment is to find it."
gemini,2015-03-25,"You may be tougher on yourself than anyone realizes today. In some ways, you're like a stage magician, for everyone just sees what you want them to see. People are fascinated with your hands waving around in the air and all the amazing stories you tell, but they don't understand this show is all about hiding the mental juggling act you are performing behind the curtain. Instead of going to such extreme measures now, just take swift action to fix what's wrong. Being honest might seem harder at first, but it is much easier to remember the truth in the long run."
cancer,2015-03-25,"Events at work have become pretty intense lately, but the problem is that you can't tell who is really in control. Don't try to outsmart others with your logic today, or you could end up tying your emotions into knots that aren't easily untangled. Thankfully, you will discover allies you didn't know you had if you simply lean toward cooperation now rather than competition. No one is completely in charge; everything works better when there is an underpinning of collaboration and an atmosphere of team spirit."
leo,2015-03-25,"Your actions may produce lasting results today without a lot of extra effort on your part. Thankfully, you won't have to wave your flag very long to get others to follow your lead. However, don't be surprised if they admire your dramatic flair instead of your conscientious work. Nevertheless, be humble; the real issue now is not about what you do; it's about how you can add meaning to the life of those around you. Let your generosity of spirit speak for itself."
virgo,2015-03-25,"You're quite proud of your work, even if no one seems to appreciate all the hoops you are jumping through to accomplish your goals. However, you might not feel like you're making much progress if you start to believe the negative feedback. Thankfully, you have more control over what happens than you realize. Your persistence will be rewarded, so remain focused on your objectives today no matter what anyone else says. Be true to yourself and your light will shine through the darkness."
libra,2015-03-25,"An artist's life is not all fun and games. There are unique challenges in expressing your creativity, even if it looks like child's play to others. Practicing self-discipline and demonstrating a strong work ethic sets the stage for a big payoff. Although you're tempted to take the easy way out now, it's imperative to keep the production lines moving today so you can reach your goals on time. Creating your masterpiece takes complete dedication on your part."
scorpio,2015-03-25,"Although your current feelings may be rather fickle, you can still learn a lot by exploring them as they change. Fortunately, you are quite adept at integrating complicated emotions lurking around in the shadows of your subconscious. However, you must resist the temptation to leave questions unanswered now just because you are restless. Instead of skipping off to the next captivating distraction today, remain in one place long enough to satisfy your quest to understand the mysteries of the cosmos."
sagittarius,2015-03-25,"You might feel as if you are stuck in a restrictive box today, but paradoxically, you don't seem to mind the constraints all that much. Although you still believe that a radical approach is your fastest route out of a difficult situation, you aren't at liberty to act on your thoughts now. Ultimately, it's nearly impossible to decide whether to be rebellious or rational. Others may encourage more reckless behavior, but the most traditional approach increases your chances for success at this time."
capricorn,2015-03-25,"You tenacious Goats are famous for climbing with even more determination when the going gets tougher, as if you want to prove that nothing will stop you from reaching the top. Nevertheless, it's challenging to concentrate now if you want to explore every opportunity that arises. Ironically, you might even appear more scattered than you actually are. There's a diabolical method to your madness today, so don't let anyone plant a seed of doubt in your mind. Believing in yourself is the key to reaching the summit."
aquarius,2015-03-25,"People tend to take you quite seriously today, even if you're channeling the weirdest and most whimsical aspects of your inner nature. Fortunately, you can play both ends of the spectrum, simultaneously being an unconventional rebel and a disciplined devotee. Although an impulsive reaction seems like the opposite of a more compulsive approach, you might somehow combine the attributes into a single posture that gets you what you need. Make the most of this magical cosmic balancing game while it lasts."
pisces,2015-03-25,"A lingering domestic issue takes an important turn toward resolution today. However, the conflict isn't over yet because there are more things yet to be said. In the meantime, you can still inch closer to a satisfying compromise if you simply let your true feelings out of the bag. Embrace the reality of your heart; sharing your hopes and fears creates an atmosphere of trust and clears a bright path to the future."
aries,2015-03-26,"Everything appears to be coming up roses now, but your positive attitude is still being directly fueled by your fantasies. You know that there is more happening beneath the surface and you are extremely curious about what isn't being said out loud. However, you may try taking the easy way out by ignoring your doubts and keeping your discomfort buried at an unconscious level. Although you might declare that you're worry-free today, it's healthier to talk about your feelings rather than avoiding them. Sharing your secrets inspires others to do the same."
taurus,2015-03-26,"You are wise to initiate action sooner rather than later today while the Moon is still hanging out in your 2nd House of Values, empowering you to clearly verbalize your core beliefs. Unfortunately, if you delay the conversation until later in the evening, you're likely to stir up an emotional melodrama. Taking the time to reveal your thoughts to a trusted friend can open a door to a meaningful discussion about your dreams for the future."
gemini,2015-03-26,"You may have to consciously slow yourself down today. If you continue to run at full speed you could be exhausted by the evening. You appear as if you're open to other people's ideas now, but chances are you have already decided your course of action. Unfortunately, if a friend confronts you about your beliefs, you could lose your temper before you know it. Be mindful and don't project your moodiness onto anyone else now, just because you might be able to get away with it. Be honest and establish firm boundaries for the sake of everyone involved."
cancer,2015-03-26,"Everything may seem rather chaotic today as you run around juggling all your projects. Unfortunately, you might not successfully fulfill your obligations if you take on too much at this time. If you become anxious about your work, an ensuing letdown could be difficult to handle. Being aware of your feelings should go a long way toward preventing an inappropriately intense emotional response to a relatively innocent question. Take a deep breath and count to ten before opening your mouth."
leo,2015-03-26,"The winds have changed and you are breathing easier today. You're able to look ahead and see all future possibilities, rather than still being tied to past responsibilities. Swing into action with firm resolve; you have a chance to accomplish more than you expect now if you stay focused on your goals throughout the day. But start early because your momentum will surely slow down as the day progresses. Strike while the iron is hot or you might miss the boat entirely."
virgo,2015-03-26,"You are determined to produce measurable results today, but your willpower gradually fades as your mind is drawn to less pragmatic things this evening. Unfortunately, you don't have the luxury of being able to lose yourself into your imagination now as a disagreement abruptly brings you back to the present moment. But don't take your annoyance out on others just because you wish you could still be meandering around in your dreams. Resolve your differences as quickly as possible so you have time to explore your fantasies."
libra,2015-03-26,"Although you may be imagining all the exotic places you want to travel to and all the intriguing people you hope to meet, you're running out of time. The weight of your unfulfilled commitments is quickly overtaking your other thoughts. This stress could lead to an unnecessary argument because it's easier to blame a friend or lover for your circumstances now. Even if you are unhappy with the current dynamics, taking full responsibility for your situation is the quickest route to reconnecting with your true self."
scorpio,2015-03-26,"You have been plucked from your natural habitat today, yet are able to quickly adapt by visualizing a time when you were more comfortable. Later in the day, the tides shift, inspiring you to rediscover the emotional connections with those you love. Unfortunately, everything might not be as simple as you wish. Acknowledge where reality falls short of your expectations in such a way that releases everyone else of the need to be responsible for your happiness."
sagittarius,2015-03-26,"It may appear as if your friends' eagerness to follow your lead is more bark than bite, making it harder to trust their intentions now. Although your current cynicism could appear out of character, you're fairly certain that others will just let you down. You might grow more sullen throughout the day and even pick a fight with someone in an attempt to express your frustration. Instead of taking your fears out on anyone else, look within for your answers. Acknowledging your role in creating the current dynamics gives you the best odds for finding a permanent solution."
capricorn,2015-03-26,"Something profound is coming down the road and as hard as you try to get out of the way, you cannot. Thankfully, physical harm is not likely, yet you may be confronted with the wide gulf between you and your loved ones now. This isn't the time to force a resolution between two people who respond very differently. Instead, stay aware of the feelings that arise, for they reveal where there is work still to be done. Listen to your heart and the mystery will solve itself in its own time."
aquarius,2015-03-26,"Finishing your chores is challenging work now, especially if you would rather be dreaming about your future than managing the mundane details of a annoying situation. But the Moon's entry into your 6th House of Work this afternoon convinces you that tomorrow will be a much more productive day. And, astrologically, this just may be true. Nevertheless, some things must be completed today or you'll just end up doing them under pressure at a later time. Bite the bullet and do what must be done."
pisces,2015-03-26,"You might go out of your way to hide your feelings today, but your attempts may not be sufficient to do the trick. Even if you sidestep a confusing situation early in the day, it's likely to swing back around and catch you off guard later. Don't stress too much if you are involved in an uncomfortable discussion. Instead of trying to emerge victorious in an argument, simply strive to find common ground or just smile and walk away."
aries,2015-03-27,"You might have to use some much-needed discretion today as your feelings deepen and seek expression in the outer world. The problem is that your intensity may be too much for others to handle now, and unless you want to push them away, it would be best clench your teeth, swallow hard and keep some things to yourself. Thankfully, you can still find joy in your solitude; don't be afraid to go it alone."
taurus,2015-03-27,"Others may see you as a force to be reckoned with, even if you are trying to downplay your power today. You are at the top of your game, making it crucial to apply your intentions with careful consideration, lest you waste the chance to move closer to your goals. There's no need to hold back, as long as you are acting with awareness and being kind to those around you. Maintaining a realistic perspective and a compassionate attitude works in your favor now."
gemini,2015-03-27,"You're sorely tempted to run out on your responsibilities to play with your associates, friends or family. This little self-indulgence would normally be fine, except you'll probably realize that lighthearted distractions are not going to be enough for you now. You are seeking ways to connect your outer world with your innermost passions. However, you won't get what you want if you push too hard. It takes a delicate touch to convey your intentions without stirring up unnecessary resistance."
cancer,2015-03-27,"The difficulty you might encounter today originates from your sensitivity clashing with your drive to pursue what you need. Although you often tend toward the passive side of the spectrum, now you feel energized and are willing to trust your instincts. Your emotions are demanding expression, so why stand in your own way? The sooner you share your desires with someone you want to impress, the closer you'll be to the potential of satisfaction. Follow your heart and don't look back."
leo,2015-03-27,"You are playing the lead role in your own personal movie today and, as long as you know when to step back from the spotlight, you will be a big hit today. However, you really don't want to be successful if you're the villain, for others might believe this to be the real you. It may be better to take off your mask and be vulnerable enough to be seen for who you are and not for what you do. Thankfully, your chances of being truly appreciated increase when you actually show up without expectations and with an open heart."
virgo,2015-03-27,"You can convince others that your position is a solid one, but you're not going to persuade anyone with your words today. Language is too shallow and just won't get your true conviction across. Your best sales tool now is your actions, which will certainly speak louder than any words you could conjure up -- even if you are highly skilled with language. Beauty is currently the major motivating force, so take your time and act only when your aesthetic sense says yes."
libra,2015-03-27,"Relationships are nearly always on your mind and these days are no exception. Although you are driven to seek pleasure today through your interactions with others, you won't be easily satisfied. But don't fall into the trap of thinking that you need more to fill your cup. It's about quality, not quantity. Going beyond the senses isn't for everyone, but life remains empty now if you can't share your feelings in a meaningful manner."
scorpio,2015-03-27,"You can't get away with any selfish behavior today because there are too many people who are counting on you. Nevertheless, you're inclined to sneak away for a bit and indulge your senses in a feast of pleasure. You don't need to turn your day upside down; you only need to carve out a little time for rejuvenating your soul. Refreshing your psyche is a great idea as long as you don't overdo it. Be creative; be real. Most of all, be true to yourself."
sagittarius,2015-03-27,"You have a unique vision to bring to life today. You may understand that your long-term goals won't be achieved right away, but whatever you do in this moment can have great impact on your future. The most important thing is to avoid acting for personal reasons alone. The more you include the needs of others in your current ambitions, the easier time you'll have of finding fulfillment."
capricorn,2015-03-27,"You may be hearing two distinct voices now, and each of them is presenting a convincing argument. On one hand, you know there's no quick fix and that you're in it for the long haul. Sometimes, it's smarter to play cautiously. On the other hand, you might feel as if you can't lose no matter what. Naturally, the truth is somewhere in the middle. You can navigate this contradiction by listening to the reactions of others. Taking their perspective into consideration helps you choose the most viable course at this time."
aquarius,2015-03-27,"Your day is overloaded with too many things to do, but there's no one to blame the apparent chaos on but yourself. You've just packed too much into a single day and made one too many promises. The good news is that you still can make it all work even if it seems impossible at first. When in doubt, ask your heart for guidance. Even if you're extremely competent, it's okay to be human. No one expects you to be a superhero all the time."
pisces,2015-03-27,"Sometimes your feelings can confuse you when you are required to exert your will. You tend to avoid direct confrontation, for it brings up issues of uncertainty within your imagination. Now, however, you can go after what you want without worrying about offending people with your honest disclosure. In fact, they will want to help you; just make sure you are clear about your destination before asking others for their support."
aries,2015-03-28,You might want to close your doors and shutter your windows today as the self-protective Cancer Moon invites you to hide from the outer world. It's not that you're ready to become a hermit; it's just that you need a little time to reflect on all the recent changes you have experienced. Don't be hard on yourself if you aren't up for another challenge just yet. Sink in to your feelings and nurture your soul. There will be plenty of time tomorrow to re-enter the fray and show off your superhero powers for the ones you love.
taurus,2015-03-28,"You like the idea of getting cozy with close friends and family today. However, you're not operating at the same speed as they are and may grow frustrated if they want you to accompany them in activities that just seem distracting. Unfortunately, your unwillingness to participate could place an unnecessary restriction on your pleasure quotient now. A more viable strategy is to go along with the fun until you reach your limit and then politely excuse yourself so you can reclaim your center of gravity. Practicing adaptability enables you to benefit from the best of both worlds."
gemini,2015-03-28,"You may be uncomfortable with sharing your emotions, especially if you think that someone is judging your every thought today. You might mistakenly believe that others see you as weak if you let your feelings get the best of you. However, this fear originates from your own false assumption that passions should be subservient to logic. Demonstrate your courage by expressing your true desires without suppressing them. Authenticity is your friend."
cancer,2015-03-28,"Your emotions are intimately linked to your metaphysical beliefs today and every aspect of your spiritual practice seems connected to a personal feeling. Luckily, you can transform negativity by adopting a more philosophical approach to life. Engaging in casual discussions about your current situation may be enough to alter your view about a difficult issue. Communication is the key; you can change your trajectory once you decide to let down your guard and talk about your fears."
leo,2015-03-28,"You might not be forthcoming with your emotions today, but the sensitive Cancer Moon's visit to your 12th House of Privacy prompts you to delve deeper into the secrets of your dreams. Whether or not you say anything about your fantasies now, you cannot escape the rich inner experience of your imagination. But don't fall too far into the trap of isolation. When the time is right, reach out and touch someone you trust by speaking your truth. Words may be all you have at first, but you can take a relationship to the next level by opening your heart."
virgo,2015-03-28,"You can benefit from an compatible relationship between your emotions and your thoughts today, even if they usually work in such separate ways. Mental Mercury's sweet trine to the Cancer Moon establishes a smooth flow of energy from the heart to the head. Naturally, you prefer to elevate your most practical thoughts over irrational feelings. Fortunately, you don't have to make a choice now. Sharing your passions with a loved one enables you to enjoy the results of clear communication while it lasts."
libra,2015-03-28,"It's simple to conjure up your ideal success story today. However, your plans aren't concrete and your daydreams are running on the fuel of inspiration. It's tricky to separate the facts from the fantasies now and the harder you try, the muddier it all becomes. Instead of seeking objectivity, allow the mind to wander without worrying about uncovering the absolute truth. Clarity will return soon enough; enjoy floating around on the clouds of imagination until it does."
scorpio,2015-03-28,"Although your creative muse is hanging around these days, it's tempting to just be lazy. Unfortunately, it currently takes extra effort to defy the urge to do nothing; you must consciously take the initiative if you want to be productive. Your current lesson is about conscious choice. Your commitment can make the difference between a day of escape and one of memorable accomplishment. Set high goals today and strive with all your might to achieve them."
sagittarius,2015-03-28,"You have enough energy to set the world on fire today, but you might not do anything about it because you don't want to upset the status quo. Nevertheless, you're growing more dissatisfied day by day and are getting closer to making a drastic move. Although you aren't necessarily ready for action, it's time to finalize your plans. Make use of the cerebral Moon-Mercury trine by wrapping words around your visions. Talking about your future as if it is real can actually help to manifest it the way you see it in your dreams."
capricorn,2015-03-28,"You may be befuddled today because others seem too clingy for your taste. You enjoy the fruits of participating in an interdependent relationship where there is mutual trust and a balance of give and take. But people who are overly needy make you want to head for the hills. However, it's wiser to give them the benefit of the doubt; they are only trying in their own way to be happy. Taking the higher road and helping a friend in need could quickly cycle around and bring you more joy than you expect."
aquarius,2015-03-28,"Holding onto old habits doesn't necessarily serve you well these days, and your ability to rationalize unproductive behavior can be a trap worth avoiding. Thankfully, you're able to see the negative pattern and break out of the rut; however, it might not happen as quickly as you hope. Don't attempt to talk yourself out of trying before you make several wholehearted attempts to open a door to a different future. There's no question about it: your mind is more powerful than you think. You only have to give it a chance to work its magic."
pisces,2015-03-28,"It seems as if someone cranked up the flow of your ingenious juices today and you can't find the off switch. Normally, this would be an exciting time, but your radical inspiration may complicate your life. On one hand, you're not interested in making a beautiful artifact for others to appreciate; you're more intrigued with finding the truth in hidden mysteries. But on the other hand, your very act of creation touches the magic of the cosmos in a way you cannot deny. Shine your brilliance by standing up to the plate and hitting one out of the park."
aries,2015-03-29,"Your confidence rises as the bright Leo Moon dances through your 5th House of Fun and Games today, but you could tire yourself out before fulfilling all of your responsibilities. Even if you believe that working faster is the answer to  your problems, this strategy of overcompensation won't likely be all that successful now. You might still need to process lingering emotions left over from a recent melodrama, so don't overextend your energy. Being methodical is the most effective way to achieve your goals and conserve your resources at the same time."
taurus,2015-03-29,"It's more complicated to express your feelings today if they seem contrary to what everyone else is experiencing. Nevertheless, denying them will only add to the tension as the fixed Leo Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family turns up the heat on a domestic issue. You may think that it's wise to avoid facing a volatile situation, but you will actually feel greatly relieved if you confront whatever is bothering you sooner than later. Opening the communication channels removes the blockages and gets the energy flowing again."
gemini,2015-03-29,"Although you might plan to fly under the radar today, the pace of events seems to be rapidly  speeding up. However, adapting your expectations to the changes allows you to appear as if you're more in control than you actually are today. Thankfully, you can shift gears so inconspicuously that others won't even realize you are feeling stressed out. Just make sure you don't expend more energy than you have or you might run out of steam next week. A little advanced planning saves you from a big headache later on."
cancer,2015-03-29,"Financial issues seem to be on your plate again, now that the Moon is camped out in your 2nd House of Money. The current solution may be as simple as attending to your personal accounting, but deeper and more complex problems might also come to the surface today. Your good intentions aren't necessarily sufficient to put everything back in order. You can improve the situation by demonstrating your responsibility and following through with whatever you start. Your extra diligence is all that's needed to turn things around in a positive direction."
leo,2015-03-29,"You may be itching to do something totally unusual today and think it would be fun to share your radical ideas with someone special. However, you might need to exercise caution because once you start talking it might not be all that easy to stop. Telling your friends about your dreams can lead to wonderful interactions, even if your visions are not yet based in reality. Just keep in mind that saying too much too soon disperses the energy prematurely. Don't spill the beans before you're certain of your plans. The anticipation is half of the fun."
virgo,2015-03-29,"The stakes seem higher today than they are in reality. Unfortunately, it's complicated to withdraw from a game that you started, even though the Moon is hiding out in your 12th House of Escapism. Be crystal clear about your intentions right from the beginning. Whatever happens now, don't be tricked into thinking that you must come out on top. If there are no winners, there are no losers; all you need to do is play your part the best you can and encourage others to do the same."
libra,2015-03-29,"You might choose to spend so much time hanging out with friends today that your chores begin to suffer. However, any projects that are still unfinished could see significant progress in the weeks ahead if you apply yourself now. Nevertheless, your productivity may not live up to your expectations no matter what you do. Thankfully, you can truly enjoy the Moon's visit to your 11th House of Social Networking if you're not overly self-critical. Luckily, you're still able to accomplish more than you expect since your window of opportunity remains open for a few days."
scorpio,2015-03-29,"Although your behavior often reveals how you feel, people can misinterpret your actions today if you don't take the time to explain your position. The expressive Leo Moon shines in your 10th House of Public Responsibility, requiring you to take charge of your life in a way that clearly demonstrates your intentions. But don't expect immediate support or you might be disappointed; it may take several days for everyone to be back on the same page. In the meantime, be clear in your communication; the resistance will fade if you bring others along on your emotional ride."
sagittarius,2015-03-29,"You're inclined to talk about your feelings in a very personal manner today. However, the emotional content of your current disclosure might catch others off guard, possibly even making them uncomfortable with your blunt honesty. Although you can moderate your intensity if you run into negativity, don't use anyone else's fear as a justification to withdraw. Instead, gently lean into an awkward situation until the stress begins to lift and the mood lightens once again."
capricorn,2015-03-29,"Relating to people's feelings can be tricky business today because their motives are probably quite different from yours. Naturally, it would be much simpler to smooth over any rough spots if you knew what others wanted. Unfortunately, you're pretty sure you are missing a piece of important information now, even if everyone appears to be forthright. Paradoxically, the more you push to uncover the mystery, the more complicated it becomes. Back off for a while and the details will reveal themselves sooner than you expect."
aquarius,2015-03-29,"A close relationship demands vigilance on your part today, but the background tension might not dissipate even if an apparent conflict is resolved. On the surface, it seems as if the dynamics are back to normal, but you could still be left with a lingering feeling of confusion. Don't make too big of a deal about your current uncertainty. Oddly enough, sometimes it makes sense to focus less on a problem, instead of more. Downplay the drama for now and let the situation unfold organically, giving everyone room to breathe."
pisces,2015-03-29,"You want to be acknowledged for your consistent efforts at work or around the home as the nurturing Moon moves through your 6th House of Routine. It doesn't matter whether your contribution is large or small; a little recognition goes a long way. But you won't get away with grandstanding for the sake of attention now; attempts to prolong your time in the spotlight will likely backfire. Just do your job with your own creative flair and rest assured that others will notice, even if they don't have anything nice to say today."
aries,2015-03-30,"Although you have been on a rocket ship ride with several planets blasting through your impetuous sign, you may be growing weary as energetic Mars prepares to leave the land of Aries tomorrow. You are envisioning an escape route just in case you need it. You could be feeling skittish if you feel cornered, but overreacting won't likely produce a positive result. Succumbing to your worries about the future only alerts others to your anxiety. For now, it's smarter to relax and listen to your heart than dream about being somewhere else."
taurus,2015-03-30,"Your unwavering determination is your greatest strength as you continue to express your love today, even in the face of an emotionally confusing situation. Lovely Venus is at her best while in your sign, even when attempting to harmonize with intense Pluto. However, this cosmic combo demands that you concentrate on the underlying feelings rather than being distracted by the surface noise. Aim deep and you won't be led off track by unimportant issues or temporary fears. You are solid now as long as you remain on course and put honesty above all else."
gemini,2015-03-30,"You are able to cleverly maintain your balance today while you are lured into unknown emotional territory. However, you may have to push past your own resistance and share your feelings, even if you're uncertain about how someone else will react to your disclosure. Thankfully, the conversation is likely to go much better than you expect now as long as you don't freeze once you start talking. But it's a two-way street; you might learn something new if you are truly willing to listen with both an open mind and an open heart."
cancer,2015-03-30,"You might sink into a deep and dark mood today as you attempt to reveal your secrets to a trusted ally. But your sense of urgency may be unfounded, provoking frustration or anger if your confidante isn't willing to match the intensity of your emotions. Nothing is to be gained by trying to change anyone else; focus on your own inner process, instead. Ironically, taking full responsibility for your feelings allows your dissatisfaction to transform into an appreciation of the love in your life."
leo,2015-03-30,"You could grow annoyed with people being so nice to you now because their support of your life plan just doesn't feel authentic. You might even see their propitiating behavior as a sign of weakness. However, it isn't wise to harden your position on an ill-conceived idea. Thankfully, you have an opportunity to show that you can be strong and yielding at the same time. Recognizing the wisdom of flexibility with respect to your desires empowers you to navigate through a very intense day with flying colors."
virgo,2015-03-30,"You think you can narrow your focus and limit your distractions in order to concentrate on what you need to do today. Unfortunately, this strategy is doomed from the start and grows more difficult to manage because your emotions are stirred, inspiring you to set your heart on some distant destination. It doesn't matter if you're incredibly smart; it's just plain foolhardy to ignore your feelings. Having more facts at your disposal won't help since you already know in your gut what you must do."
libra,2015-03-30,"You may be feeling quite confident about your current plans now, but something is still gnawing away in the dark at the back of your mind. You might be limited in your options today, especially if you're obsessing about a relationship from the past. But trying to escape from your personal history is futile; dig into it with passionate curiosity, instead. Once you can find your way around in the shadows of your subconscious, you'll be better able to navigate in the light of reality. Trust your heart to lead you in the right direction."
scorpio,2015-03-30,"Your unexpressed anger can cool into ice and morph into resentment, which is exponentially more difficult to process. Fortunately, vulnerable Venus trines your key planet Pluto today, exacerbating your emotions and preventing them from going quiet. Letting go and acting on your intuition is easy if you can relinquish your fears first. Following your instincts now is your best insurance against fostering negativity. A grateful mind is a powerful mind."
sagittarius,2015-03-30,"Your sense of self-worth and net worth are inextricably intertwined today, even if they usually seem like separate issues. Today's passionate Venus-Pluto trine impacts your 2nd House of Resources, empowering you to ride an intense emotional wave of energy. You might want to consider cashing in on your current confidence and asking for a raise or a promotion. Naturally, the dynamics at work need to support your request, but in any case your contribution and your courage won't go unnoticed."
capricorn,2015-03-30,"You are still enjoying the sweet benefits of lovely Venus skipping through your 5th House of Spontaneity. Your involvement in a significant creative project or a new romance may be intensifying, and you're tempted to go overboard as you try to give the performance of your life. This can be quite a memorable day as long as you don't struggle to accomplish the impossible. It's better to thoroughly explore one feeling today than to pursue several different options."
aquarius,2015-03-30,"It's refreshing to feel so creative today and exciting to believe that things could get even better during the next few days. However, your happy-go-lucky attitude may be quite deceptive now. You might skillfully disarm someone's aggression, yet you're still ready for serious business in a moment's notice. Use your keen ability to shift back and forth between the light-hearted and heavy-handed extremes, so you can make the most of every moment. Your charm and tenacity are an unbeatable combination."
pisces,2015-03-30,"You may be afraid that the negativity of someone at work might grow into more of a problem during the days ahead. Although nipping a worrisome situation in the bud sounds like an intelligent plan, it's not always the smartest strategy to suppress the natural expression of uncomfortable emotions like fear and anger. If you really want to preempt potential trouble, ask thoughtful questions and be an active listener as well. Sometimes, all a person needs is to be heard."
aries,2015-03-31,"It's odd, but you can't decide whether everything is going along as it should or if something weird is happening that's pulling your day off track. You might be afraid that you're not as in control as you wish today, even if you're making progress on the most important projects. Perhaps you would be more satisfied if everything was turned upside down, but it feels as if some sort of cosmic superglue is keeping the status quo from coming apart at the seams. Don't worry so much about things you can't change; it's time to accept that the universe has different plans for you."
taurus,2015-03-31,"You may experience such a strong boost of energy today that your confidence soars to new heights. However, your enthusiasm isn't about unrealistic expectations based on pie-in-the-sky fantasies. You actually try to pin your hopes on the facts as you see them. Nevertheless, something is out of kilter and you might be surprised by a sudden shift in the cosmic weather. Instead of running around trying to figure out what you missed, gracefully integrate the changes as quickly as possible. Just like a colorful chameleon, adaptability works in your favor."
gemini,2015-03-31,"You are not overly concerned with reaching your goals today because you realize how arbitrary time can be. After all, there is always tomorrow. Your feelings are more important to you now than your production, regardless of what anyone expects. Unfortunately, you can't completely separate yourself from the judgments of others who are sharing your space. Even if you believe that your reactions are strictly your business, living with people in close vicinity requires sacrifice and compromise on an ongoing basis. No man is an island."
cancer,2015-03-31,"Although your career aspirations are still meaningful, you're dreaming about your future in less concrete terms now. Ironically, you might believe that your goals are built upon sensible expectations, even if they're not. However, all the substantiating facts in the world aren't enough to pull you back to earth today. Don't fight the natural rhythm of the cosmos. Give yourself permission to follow the currents wherever they carry you for the sake of the experience."
leo,2015-03-31,"You might wish you could kick back and let everyone continue on without you today. But you know that others are judging you by what you accomplish so you have a difficult time of relinquishing your real world obligations. Make heart-centered choices; whatever you do now, it's crucial to positively reinforce your self-esteem. It's not helpful to decide upon a course of action based upon your assumptions about the reactions of anyone else. Your success is best measured by the level of your personal satisfaction and the pride you take in your work."
virgo,2015-03-31,"You are happiest today when you are actively pursuing your future. Unfortunately, there are a few unexpected bends in the road, and you may be confused about reaching your ultimate destination if you're pulled too far off course. Nevertheless, your task is to hold steady on your current path now, even if you feel like you've lost the plot to your story. Whether or not you can see through the fog, your light shines brightly for those close to you. It only takes one candle to light up the dark."
libra,2015-03-31,It doesn't really matter how long a particular friendship has already lasted; you are ready to emotionally shift gears today. Taking things to the next level sounds like a lovely idea now that assertive Mars enters your strange and intimate 8th House of Deep Feelings. But the trick is to move slowly and remain open to the rhythms of the heart. There is no need to rush what should unfold naturally. Honesty and trust are essential ingredients for your happiness.
scorpio,2015-03-31,"Someone's agenda crosses paths with yours today and you're not willing to just walk away from an unresolved confrontation. The best possible course to take is one of direct communication and unflagging honesty. However, your passionate emotions might not blend well with the theme of practicality called for by four planets in earth signs. Forget about settling your differences or proving your point now. Instead listen to the other person's ideas and simply acknowledge his or her position. Awareness leads to mutual respect and, hopefully, your peace of mind."
sagittarius,2015-03-31,"You may lose steam this afternoon but running out of energy might not be as bad as it sounds. Instead of just powering your way over any obstacles you encounter, you have to take a longer view if you want to reach the finish line. This philosophical perspective requires you to cultivate a special skill to a new level of competence. Luckily, you are likely to gain tools now that will benefit you for the rest of your life, regardless of the progress you make on your goals today. Life is a marathon, not a sprint."
capricorn,2015-03-31,"Your center of gravity is strong enough today to withstand a cyclone. You are determined to reach your destination and nothing will obstruct your forward progress. Nevertheless, you still may have to deal with more than you bargained for because what you see is not necessarily what you get. Life plays tricks on you now, even if you think you're prepared for any type of emergency. Take stock of all your options and be ready for the mind games that can haunt you when reality is bent out of shape."
aquarius,2015-03-31,"You would like to push beyond your regular patterns of communication but might not know the best way to get started. You tend to be more effective when working in pure conceptual realms, but have trouble escaping from a more pragmatic view over the next few weeks. Don't assume you have all the answers just because you've amassed a lot of information. Sometimes the most useful solutions come from the emptiness that's between the noisy facts and figures. Dancing with the unknown leads to your success."
pisces,2015-03-31,"Life can feel like a struggle if others demand more precision and detail than you have to offer today. You wish you could remain floating around in your dream world, yet you realize that there is work to do and it won't just happen on its own. However, it may seem as if your extra efforts are for naught if you aren't making much headway on any one project. Nevertheless, it's a big mistake to judge your success by rational analysis now. The most significant progress eludes measurement, so save your assumptions and conclusions for another day. Let your imagination run the show."
aries,2015-04-01,"It seems as if so much has happened these past few months that your life has irrevocably changed. Although the stability you once relied on has faded, you could gain small victories in your current battle to regain control. You're ready to swing into action right away now that clever Mercury is visiting your spontaneous sign. But reacting too quickly might have you running off in the wrong direction, determined to fix a problem that can wait. Ask someone you trust to help you set new priorities today before you make a mistake. Look before you leap."
taurus,2015-04-01,"You aren't the first one to come up with a viable answer to an annoying dilemma today, but your solution is sound enough that it is worth waiting for. Your idea may appear overly simplistic on the surface, but it's nearly impossible for others to find a flaw in your rock-solid logic. Ironically, the pieces of your plan all fit so well together that others might suspect you of hiding the truth for the sake of expediency. Don't back off just to calm someone else's fears; the resistance will dissipate faster than you expect, allowing you to be the hero in the end."
gemini,2015-04-01,There won't be many unexpected surprises today because mischievous Mercury is held in check by somber Saturn. You are standing on a foundation stable enough to support a reliable action plan. But don't settle for less and accept the status quo when you can stretch yourself further and establish exciting new goals. Grab this opportunity to demonstrate your analytical skills while your logic is as good as it gets.
cancer,2015-04-01,"The unrelenting intensity of your desires continues to rattle your world, even as your new-found clarity subdues your frazzled nerves now. If your plans are still ambiguous because you can't make up your mind, the fog begins to clear today, offering you the ability to see what's ahead. Deciding how to best tie up loose ends is a smart strategy today if you want to be ready for the future when it arrives. You might be shocked by how much you accomplish if you just keep your head down and stay focused. Channel your passion into your work."
leo,2015-04-01,"You might think you have too much on your plate and are worried about getting everything done on time. Although your anxiety is likely self-imposed now, you grow calmer as the day proceeds. Thankfully, there is little need to overcompensate by proving anything to anyone today; your current fear of failure is likely unwarranted. Do whatever you can without creating unrealistic expectations and then set new goals tomorrow when your far-sighted vision improves. One job done right is better than several left undone."
virgo,2015-04-01,"You may be less traditional in your thinking today than others realize, even if it seems as if you're towing the party line. Your ideas might actually be quite progressive, yet keeping them hidden is a good idea now so you don't seem out of place at work. Fortunately, you have the ability to concentrate one hundred percent on your career if you so choose. Your singular focus could be enough to ease the pressure that's building in other areas of your life at this time. Energy flows where attention goes."
libra,2015-04-01,"You take your role as arbitrator of reality quite seriously today, but people may be growing weary of your desire to fix relationships that don't live up to your exacting standards. Your friends and associates might think you have done enough and now it's time for you to back off. However, you're very patient and you're willing to wait before taking any initiative. Making decisions for others before you attend to your own personal business won't help matters. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones."
scorpio,2015-04-01,"You can achieve a high level of personal satisfaction now, even if the dynamics of your current relationships are complicated. Unfortunately, unresolved issues may provoke you to disclose secrets that you would normally keep to yourself. Thankfully, your reasoning is very sound, allowing you to effectively consider all the possible scenarios before saying something you might later regret. Nevertheless, it's still wise to acknowledge old insecurities so they don't impede your progress. Remember who you're talking to before you say a word."
sagittarius,2015-04-01,"You may be exploring strategies to stabilize a relationship, especially if your partner seems to be acting flighty now. You are ready to take desperate action if you think someone you care about is slipping away. But rather than needlessly panicking, this is the time for cool and collected behavior. Slow down and think everything through first. Your rational approach of sharing your concerns in a non-judgmental manner inspires others to meet you halfway. Leading by example lets your true intentions shine through."
capricorn,2015-04-01,"It might seem as if your schedule has become so hectic now that it is too crazy for you to handle. Thankfully, you are blessed with organizational superpowers today as cunning Mercury forms an easy trine with your key planet Saturn, bringing much-needed stability to the chaos. But taking on too much can be disastrous now, so don't try to do everything all at once. Set practical priorities before you initiate action; make a list and then methodically check off the items one at a time for the best results. Don't forget that you're the master of your own destiny."
aquarius,2015-04-01,"If you have been procrastinating lately, use your time management skills to create a structured calendar that leaves you room to run your errands and still connect with others. Go out of your way to communicate with friends and coworkers because people will take your ideas more seriously today. There's no reason to wait any longer; you are a force to be reckoned with now and your positive attitude goes a long way toward propelling you on the road to success."
pisces,2015-04-01,"Today is the day to deliver your final answer, especially if you have been delaying a major decision. Nevertheless, you won't likely act foolishly because communicator Mercury is obeying orders from cautious Saturn, adding a cool logic to your thought process. Following a hunch often works best for you, but cold hard facts will take you even further now. Remember, your best choices are made with both your head and your heart."
aries,2015-04-02,"Your life is unfolding in warp-speed motion today, yet it might not seem overwhelming at all. In fact, you could be experiencing great pleasure in keeping up with the hectic pace. Paradoxically, you are quite realistic about the hard work ahead, even if your ideas about all your current projects are blown out of proportion. Nevertheless, exercising a little caution is helpful and may be the key that enables you to accomplish the very ambitious goals you have set. Feeding off the buzz can carry you to great new heights."
taurus,2015-04-02,"You don't need anyone to inspire you today; you woke up with a specific agenda in mind and are eager to do nearly anything to manifest your dreams. Although you're optimistic about achieving your objectives, the frenzied atmosphere at work takes a lot out of you as you try to tame the chaos. You may crave peace and quiet, but you might not be so lucky to find it now. Instead of trying to slow everything down, just move into the situation knowing that your life is changing for the better. Fly, baby, fly."
gemini,2015-04-02,"You may be surprised by the consistency of enthusiastic support you are receiving from your coworkers and friends now. Try as you might to remain calm and collected, you are more likely to be thrilled by the variety of possibilities in front of you. Keep in mind that even the most stable relationship needs to evolve so you can take full advantage of an upcoming opportunity. Don't be content with the comfort of stability because you stand to gain more if you maintain your flexibility today. Think big; the stretch will do you good."
cancer,2015-04-02,"You can tell that the days ahead may present a few challenges, even if you're looking forward to the work. However, you might need to show your muscle by taking control of the situation and steering it in the right direction. Unfortunately, so much is going on now that you can't stay on top of every minute detail. Your best strategy is to pick a project and give it your very best. Although it could take a few days before you see positive results, your commitment to the long haul helps you make the most of the day."
leo,2015-04-02,"You want to take time off to play today but you might have too many responsibilities to just get up and go. Although taskmaster Saturn rains on your parade in your 5th House of Recreation, you can still find a way to express your joy. You may be frustrated because it feels like certain aspects of your life have grown out of control. Even if you are facing trials and tribulations now, sharing the love that is in your heart turns hard work into child's play."
virgo,2015-04-02,"You may be required to grow in unexpected ways now by exercising your compassionate side, especially if complicated relationship dynamics are at play. However, you can't pretend you're comfortable with what's going on if you're not. But the kindest solution to this dilemma is to take the time to try to understand the motives of those you love. This conscious choice to walk in someone else's shoes allows you to support others in their process, even when it's not the same path as yours."
libra,2015-04-02,"Your long-term objectives may be in jeopardy, especially if others are relying on you more than you expected. Unfortunately, you could be so enthusiastic that you over-commit every which way you turn today. Nevertheless, you're being guided now by a sensible inner voice that reminds you to slow down and be methodical in your approach, which gives you the time needed to be present for someone else. Remember, when you help a friend, the positive energy cycles back around to you in surprising ways."
scorpio,2015-04-02,"New opportunities seem to come your way at work now, but they actually originate from you and not anyone else. Your positive and passionate attitude may have more to do with your response to the flow of external events than anything else. Good fortune could change at the drop of a hat unless you develop a practice around learning to graciously accept the abundance of the universe. When you know that you deserve the best, you will be more apt to receive it."
sagittarius,2015-04-02,"It may seem like the unshakeable foundation you have been seeking is now very close to materializing -- even if it's still just somewhere out on the horizon. You nostalgically yearn for a lost certainty to guide you through the complex choices ahead. But your potential growth depends upon temporarily letting go of your dreams of stability. Instead, be open to fulfillment in the present moment and not in some distant future. Be here now."
capricorn,2015-04-02,"You are attempting to gracefully balance your relentless drive to get ahead with your irrepressible desire for security. Sometimes you're not satisfied with your current circumstances, yet neither are you willing to risk your position just to achieve more. You might think that it's impossible to make steady gains today, but you can accomplish more than you expect if you take it one step at a time. You don't need to gamble your present on your future to come out on top."
aquarius,2015-04-02,"Something has changed and you aren't clear yet as to how all the pieces of the picture will fit back together. Relationships demand your immediate attention and you are willing to do your part to reap the rewards. Although you are finally at the beginning of a new cycle, you still must practice patience, for balancing self-restraint with enthusiasm is an ongoing process. Trust your intuition, especially if you don't have all the facts yet. Transforming uncertainty into positive action increases your chances for success."
pisces,2015-04-02,"If you applied yourself effectively over the past weeks, you will be recognized now for a job well done. Kudos from your coworkers or even your boss surely brightens your outlook. You could even receive an influx of unexpected cash as the radiant Sun in your 2nd House of Money harmonizes with lucky Jupiter in your 6th House of Work. Fortunately, the abundance of the cosmos will take care of you now if you just let go and let it."
aries,2015-04-03,"You want to say what's on your mind right away, but you will be better off if you let the other person speak first. It's not helpful to think about your response while someone else is still talking; you need to listen to every word that's being said. Only after you have thoroughly digested what you heard can you begin to successfully communicate your point of view. Forget about trying to defend your conclusion to the bitter end. Success is more likely if you are open to improving your strategy by listening to the perspectives of those who disagree with you as well as those who support you."
taurus,2015-04-03,"Demonstrating your stellar competence while remaining open to receiving help from others can be a real challenge today. You might think you know how to do your job better than anyone else, but a different perspective could be exactly what you need. Although you might be annoyed at first if someone offers assistance, acknowledging your insecurities may be the key that allows you to accept support. Leaning on others is easier once you admit you are human just like everyone else."
gemini,2015-04-03,"You can't wait to express your feelings to someone you love, but it still might be difficult to say what you really mean. Although your message can have a positive impact, you could be so charged with emotion that you sound overly aggressive unless you tone down your approach. Fortunately, making a conscious effort to soften your words allows you to convey your intentions without upsetting anyone else. Choosing the right time and place to begin a conversation can make a huge difference in how your disclosure is received."
cancer,2015-04-03,"It's not easy to be as generous as you want to be today, especially if you think someone is taking advantage of your kind nature. Unfortunately, your ability to care for those you love might be compromised if your good intentions turn cold with anger or suspicion. Overreacting isn't useful but neither is retreating into your shell; calmly express your concerns and then continue to honor the boundaries you set. Others appreciate your assistance most when you approach them with an open heart."
leo,2015-04-03,"You could easily convince yourself you are doing the right thing today, but overstating your case can lead to a big mess. The resistance you now face may prompt you to be more forceful than usual if your behavior isn't in alignment with your heart. Take a moment and review your actions to be certain you are on the right path. Walking your talk is the fastest way to get noticed. Shine your light for all the world to see."
virgo,2015-04-03,"Impulsive spending isn't a very wise idea today because it might upset the tenuous balance between your living expenses and your current income. You are usually quite careful about managing your cash flow, but could easily mislead yourself now if you don't pay attention to all the factors that impact your fiscal condition. Thankfully, you can avoid future trouble by keeping your credit cards in your wallet until the temptation passes. Money won't buy you happiness, but focusing on the spiritual aspects of your life can make all the difference in the world."
libra,2015-04-03,"Scheming and dreaming is a constructive use of your time now that the reflective Moon is back in your strategic sign. However, even with the cosmic energy on your side, you shouldn't try to get away with any shady dealings. You have an excellent sense of how action and reaction work together today, motivating you to take control of your life. But don't move too quickly because you will likely reach your goals faster if you ease off the accelerator pedal just enough so there's no reason to jam on the brakes down the road."
scorpio,2015-04-03,"You could morph into Don Quixote today in search of enemies to fight, only to discover they are windmills in reality. Your imagination can be the source of exquisite beauty or tumultuous agitation. Resist the urge to put on your armor and head off into battle, for your greatest challenge now is a spiritual one. Your demons exist only within the confines of your own mind. But you can't make your dark emotions disappear by avoiding them. Transform your anger into love by using it to fuel positive change."
sagittarius,2015-04-03,"You adventurous Archers enjoy basking in your dreams of distant horizons, so you love that you can see even further into the future now. Unfortunately, you could grow so enamored with all the possibilities that you take a foolish risk just to make something happen right away. Nevertheless, you don't need to do anything rash because you are progressing at exactly the right speed according to the cosmic plan. Bring your awareness back the current circumstances where your actions can have the most impact."
capricorn,2015-04-03,"You might try to keep your shrewdly calculating nature in check today, but you can't stop thinking about how to distinguish yourself from the pack. Your ambitions run strong while the evocative Moon is back in your 10th House of Career, bringing out your innate affinity for climbing the ladder of success. However, if you realize that you're being overly aggressive at work, consciously pull in your energy so you can regain a healthier perspective. Time is on your side so use it wisely to bring others with you on your rise to the top."
aquarius,2015-04-03,You might think about spontaneously purchasing an airline ticket to satiate your craving for adventure now that the Moon is camping out in your 9th House of Journeys. But this wanderlust is not simply about getting out of town; you have a powerful longing to experience something outside of your current reality. Your ability to create a fantasy to your liking works in your favor today. It doesn't matter if you can't take time off to go on a wild safari or a shopping excursion in Milan; you can travel to the distant edges of the cosmos and back without ever having to leave home.
pisces,2015-04-03,"Your passions may prove difficult to ignore as the Moon travels through your 8th House of Intimacy. Intuitively, you know exactly what you want and are ready to go for it, even if the consequences could complicate your life. Although you're receiving powerful help from magical Neptune, it still may be impossible to make your dreams come true now. Don't wallow in your disappointment because your desires will change radically in the days ahead. Play out all the options in your mind today instead of blindly blasting your way into the unknown."
aries,2015-04-04,"You're willing to jump in but your common sense reminds you of the price you often pay when you dive in before testing the depth and temperature of the water. Today's Libra Lunar Eclipse is opposite your Aries Sun sign, complicating your life because of the strong ambivalence it brings. Something doesn't feel quite right and you're correct to trust your instincts now. Before you say yes without thinking first, pull back a bit to find a healthy balance."
taurus,2015-04-04,"You might have so many obligations to fulfill now that you think you have a valid excuse to avoid intimacy. Although you may not feel very playful with the Libra Full Moon Eclipse rattling your 6th House of Routine, you can use its energy to restore harmony to your life. Have fun as you go about doing your chores instead of putting them off for another day. It's all about your attitude, so whistle while you work for the best results."
gemini,2015-04-04,"Although having an emotional meltdown is not your style, you could cheat yourself out of an amazing experience today if you don't delve beneath the surface of your heart. Perhaps you are busy playing with your friends now that the Libra Full Moon Eclipse is activating your 5th House of Spontaneity. However, you still might be distracted by an unresolved relationship issue. Handle your problems while maintaining a lighthearted attitude. But don't bother trying to fake it; others will appreciate you more if you show your true colors."
cancer,2015-04-04,"You could attempt to ignore your intense feelings, but avoidance isn't a useful strategy. Nevertheless, the Libra Lunar Eclipse polarizes your 4th House of Emotional Security, tempting you to withdraw from an unexpected drama. However, your retreat may leave you wondering what you missed. There's no need to put up artificial walls just to protect yourself from outdated childhood fears. Start a dialogue with your subconscious today, since that's where you will discover the answers. Just remember to reach out to others once you have found a solution to your dilemma."
leo,2015-04-04,"The fickle winds of change are blowing in like spring breezes as the Libra Full Moon Eclipse shines in your 3rd House of Communication. Expressing unresolved feelings causes you to confront your shortcomings rather than just retelling your success stories. You may feel like you're not exactly where you want to be now, but don't stress about things you cannot change. Dealing with issues as soon as they crop up today can set you back on the right path to a prosperous future."
virgo,2015-04-04,"You feel as if people can't be trusted now because they don't seem to care as much about integrity as you do. Although today's rational Libra Lunar Eclipse highlights your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, it also requires you to be practical when sharing your emotions. Others may think you're backpedaling, but you probably aren't the one who is putting on the brakes. Don't get discouraged if you feel misunderstood. Display the warmth you want to receive by keeping your heart open and your feelings close to the surface."
libra,2015-04-04,"A sudden jolt of awareness may force you to abandon your plans as the Full Moon Eclipse rocks your sign. However, you are better off if you don't make a fuss even if your production or performance is unjustly criticized. Although it's true that the actions of other people are likely beyond your control, nothing is gained by worrying about what they do. Instead, concentrate on your own emotional process, even if it happens to involve someone else for a while. Facing a stressful relationship issue today contributes to your happiness as long as you are honest with yourself."
scorpio,2015-04-04,"Concealing your feelings today seems like your smartest course of action, and even those close to you can't figure out your inner workings. Your emotions are on edge as the Libra Full Moon Eclipse runs into a series of stressful aspects from your 12th House of Destiny. Instead of withholding your love while you reevaluate your personal relationships, use your logic to overcome your fear of intimacy. Ultimately, expressing your negative emotions in a calm manner helps to transform sharing them into a positive experience."
sagittarius,2015-04-04,"Unfortunately, you may be seeking romance while only finding platonic companions today. The lovely Libra Full Moon Eclipse lights up your 11th House of Groups and Friends, activating the fun-filled social axis of your chart. There is nothing wrong with a wonderful friendship, but it just doesn't have the same level of passion as a love story. Don't let disappointment throw you into a tailspin of low self-esteem. Allowing others to see into your heart creates an environment where relationships can continue to thrive."
capricorn,2015-04-04,"Everyone seems to be making demands on you now that the Libra Full Moon Eclipse agitates your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Don't try to hide your insecurities about meeting your commitments. Even if you put in extra effort, you still could end up exhausted without finishing everything. Find a manageable pace and just do the best you can. Be as direct as possible when letting others know your limits; your honesty and work ethic won't go unappreciated by those who matter most."
aquarius,2015-04-04,"Communication wires cross today as the Libra Full Moon Eclipse kicks up an energetic storm in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Your schedule may grow so complex and unwieldy that you feel like you can't keep it together. Unfortunately, there's no way out of this tricky situation unless you are practical when navigating the current circumstances. If there isn't enough time in your day, figure out how to do more with less effort. Take a risk and try something different now; the solution might not be what you think. If you are open to the possibilities, your inspiration can carry you far."
pisces,2015-04-04,"You may be afraid of your own shadow today as the Libra Full Moon Eclipse floods your 8th House of Intimacy. Thankfully, you are fully equipped to handle the current disintegration of boundaries. One of the benefits of having such a rich fantasy life is that you are prepared for nearly anything. Don't waste time trying to fight against the prevailing tides because intense emotional interactions might sweep you away. If you flow with the energy, you will emerge on the other side with your sense of humor still intact and a new appreciation for life."
aries,2015-04-05,"Keeping your social life in order requires a real diligence on your part today because of pressures building from several different directions. You might have too many commitments on your calendar or your schedule may be disrupted by an urgent need to take care of more pressing personal issues. But even if you try to avoid emotional confrontation now, circumstances demand that you deal with the conflict between your feelings and someone else's agenda. This is a turning point in managing your relationships; responding honestly sets a positive example for everyone else."
taurus,2015-04-05,"You might wholeheartedly believe you are doing the right thing, yet you still must answer to a higher power today. But this unexpected reality check is not a spiritual issue; someone in authority could be on your case and won't let you have your way. It doesn't matter if you think your plans are reasonable, you will have to change them anyway. Negotiate with sincerity while remaining open to relinquishing control, if necessary. Compromise may be required to make the progress you seek."
gemini,2015-04-05,"Your need for control clashes with the desires of others as you attempt to avoid an interaction that's too intense for your taste. A complicated balance of power reaches a tilting point today and the current situation may unleash more drama than you prefer. Although you might spin your wheels trying to prevent your fears from actually manifesting, powerful magic awaits if you have the courage to trust the emotional process. Thankfully, everyone should feel relief once the storm subsides and your resistance fades into the past."
cancer,2015-04-05,"Your responsibilities may keep you from enjoying quality time at home with your family. Irrepressible emotions creep into your awareness, upsetting your equilibrium -- but there are no quick fixes to the complex crosscurrents that complicate your life. You'll probably feel a lot better tomorrow if you don't overreact today. In the meantime, take this opportunity to dig into the shadows of your imagination to find a healthy balance. The more work you do now, the more flexible your schedule will be during the days ahead."
leo,2015-04-05,"Maintaining a positive perspective can be nearly impossible if someone's coercive tactics undermine your best intentions. You may attract more trouble than you need today, especially if an authority figure attempts to manipulate your behavior. Don't over-personalize the current conflict; this isn't the greatest time to make your stand. Although adaptability is smarter than resistance now, don't compromise your ideals just to keep the peace."
virgo,2015-04-05,"You're not hiding anything on purpose now, but it could be natural to be a little secretive about a romantic attraction. It's rather awkward to deal with your needs today because the intensity of your feelings makes you feel uncomfortable. Even if you are confident you can balance your inner desires with the outer restraints, it's still challenging to remain hopeful if you are unsatisfied with the current circumstances. You don't need to tell everyone everything, but confiding in a trusted friend helps you see things from a brighter perspective."
libra,2015-04-05,"It's not your style to rock the boat, but you may need to walk on the wild side today. Relationship dynamics might be stressed to a breaking point if someone doesn't want to broach a difficult topic. Or, perhaps you are the one who doesn't want to talk about the elephant in the room. Confronting a lingering interpersonal conflict is more sensible now than allowing the problem to fester and infect other areas of your life. It's healthier to share your vulnerability, for your fears only gain power when suppressed. Take a risk and start a meaningful conversation while you have the chance."
scorpio,2015-04-05,"Navigating the unfriendly and possibly turbulent emotional currents of the day is tricky because environmental factors are swiftly altering the conditions of your life. You may even feel as if you are at odds with someone you love but you aren't ready to share your concerns yet. However, no matter what happens now, remember that there will be plenty of time in a few days to revisit this very same issue with less anxiety and turmoil. In the meantime, slowly back away from the entanglement and give everyone, including yourself, a bit of breathing room."
sagittarius,2015-04-05,"Even if everything is coming up roses, everything isn't as rosy as it appears now. Don't be fooled just because others seem to be wholeheartedly supporting your agenda. It's not a smart idea to relax and let down your guard today because it's not likely that you can see the complete picture. Building a relationship solely on promises won't work, so be prepared to get your hands dirty while digging for the truth. It's wise to nip a little problem in the bud before it grows into a much larger one. Cultivating a garden takes work."
capricorn,2015-04-05,"Your greatest strength comes from your innate ability to build your life on the solid ground of practicality. Unfortunately, emotional conflicts can now shake the very same mountain that you are so cautiously and methodically climbing. Don't try to avoid your feelings, since they hold the key that will ultimately lead you to a safer place. What you resist will only persist. Surprisingly, you can minimize the potential damage by gently but firmly pushing your emotions out into the open."
aquarius,2015-04-05,"Fear of losing control of your schedule may trick you into being so rigid with your time today that everything actually falls apart. Unfortunately, the more you micromanage your calendar now, the less stable it becomes. Don't waste your energy trying to react preemptively. Flexibility is your friend; ride the currents of change and handle each problem only as it surfaces. Imagine there's no past or future; the only lasting impact you can make on your life is in the present moment."
pisces,2015-04-05,"Your values might conflict with those of your friends, placing uncomfortable demands on you now. You might believe it's your job to bridge a gulf in a social situation that's actually beyond your control. Instead of trying to fix things, consider how you hold onto familiar behavior patterns because of your fear of change. Your old habits are being tested by new circumstances, so there's no reason to struggle against the cosmic forces. Let go and make room for the universe to show you the opportunities ahead."
aries,2015-04-06,"You're not willing to continue on in your old ways any longer. You are eagerly anticipating a big change, but aren't ready to communicate your new perspective to anyone else because you don't want to shock your friends with your radical ideas. Nevertheless, you might not be able to contain your enthusiasm today and may blurt out the truth before you even think about what you're going to say. Thankfully, it isn't necessary to stress about something you haven't yet shared; everything will come out into the open when the time is right."
taurus,2015-04-06,"You may be full of revolutionary ideas today but still have a difficult time communicating your beliefs to others if you try to cover too much ground. Although you normally can set and maintain a sustainable pace, you're not interested in buying into the status quo now. Don't struggle too much, even if your best plans fall apart under pressure. Originality is temporarily more important than practicality; you can always fine tune your strategies later in the week. Thinking outside of the box is just what the doctor ordered."
gemini,2015-04-06,"You may be thrilled with your new sense of freedom, yet the wide variety of possibilities can also be a bit disconcerting today. Perhaps you didn't see any changes in your immediate future, but thankfully, you're quite skilled at thinking on your feet and making the most of the current instability. There's no time to look back and question what you might have done differently. Step out of your comfort zone and decide what you can do to improve your life right now. Your future is in your hands so strike while the iron is hot."
cancer,2015-04-06,"Your protective shell is beginning to crack and you're not feeling as emotionally secure as you prefer. Career plans may need to be changed due to unforeseeable complications. However, you could also discover something entirely new that can irrevocably alter the way you see yourself in the world. No matter how this transit plays out, remember that your direction in life is shifting. Give yourself permission to explore any new path that opens in front of you. Personal growth isn't possible now unless you're willing to take a risk."
leo,2015-04-06,"You receive a magical message from the universe today that ultimately takes you on an amazing adventure. It might seem as if a lightning bolt shatters your preconceived perceptions about a friend or coworker. You have held onto a belief that's been useful for you in the past, but is no longer doing you justice in the present. Don't be afraid to let go of an outmoded idea that gets in the way of your current happiness. Keeping an open mind now is not as easy as it sounds, but it can dramatically change everything in the blink of an eye."
virgo,2015-04-06,"A powerful person who is usually your ally might act so far out of character today that you aren't sure how to interpret his or her odd behavior. Your initial reaction may be one of irritation, but you also could laugh uncontrollably if you don't know how to appropriately respond. However, it's possible that others are just acting out your own rebellious streak. Instead of judging them for their outrageous antics, do something a little crazy yourself. Dance like no is watching and stop worrying about everyone else."
libra,2015-04-06,"You're searching for ways to cope with the current chaos and exploring new relationship strategies to help stabilize your life. You might think you're ready for something entirely different, but may not be prepared for so much transition all at once. Nevertheless, sticking to your agenda could become a study in frustration, so stop holding onto old habits just because you don't want to deal with change. A cosmic wind is blowing the cobwebs out of the stagnant corners of your life; open up the windows and let it do its job."
scorpio,2015-04-06,"You may experiment with a totally radical approach at work today without telling anyone anything about your plans. Nevertheless, you won't likely be able to conceal your excitement or your anxiety as your emotions run to the extremes. Everything is happening so lightning-fast now that you might spill the beans without even considering your audience. Don't stress about your spontaneous outburst; once you've spoken your piece, you will feel a great sense of relief. Be proud of your inspiration since you have nothing to hide."
sagittarius,2015-04-06,"Perhaps you initially thought you would be more collaborative on a creative project today. Still, you want to hear everyone's opinions and then integrate what you learn into your plans. But compromise is more challenging now than you ever expected -- especially when you realize how strongly you value your own imagination. Although it's fine to know what you want, don't be too eager to impose your will on others unless you want to start a fight. If your ideas are sound enough, you might just have to strike out on your own."
capricorn,2015-04-06,"Your ongoing need to maintain order at home makes it tricky to handle the surprising twists and turns that come out of nowhere today. Although you may think you must react quickly to capitalize on this sudden shift of power, there's nothing you have to do in the immediate moment. However, rather than altering your behavior by going on the offense, you can consciously modify your emotional reactions instead. As your attitude changes, everything else in your life will follow."
aquarius,2015-04-06,"Your immediate environment is not as stable today as you think. Unexpected events may cause radical realignments in your relationships with those you encounter on a daily basis. People may seem less dependable now, making their behavior impossible to predict. However, the real lesson is about learning to trust yourself, even if you don't meet the expectations of others. When you eliminate the unnecessary self-criticism, your judgments of everyone else will mellow, too. Compassion is a two-way street."
pisces,2015-04-06,"Your friends may be confused by your rebellious behavior; they don't know what to expect from you now because you aren't interested in towing the party line. You want to be treated fairly and are ready to cut your ties to make your point. Unfortunately, financial concerns can complicate your decisions since you need to pay your bills, too. Preemptive downsizing is a smart strategy if you don't wait until it's too late. Demonstrating your reliability gives others a valid reason to rally to your support."
aries,2015-04-07,"You might suddenly realize there is a limit to your seemingly bottomless well of vitality. You could be running on empty now because it's unlikely that you conserved much energy over the past few weeks. Don't pretend that you can continue to carry on without making some much-needed modifications to your lifestyle. Instead of waiting until you hit the proverbial wall, make time for some overdue rest today. There is no valid excuse for procrastinating when it comes to taking care of your health."
taurus,2015-04-07,"Your biggest and best ideas could create problems today if you have overextended your reach. You might even feel desperate, leading you to believe that your increased effort will overcome poor planning. If your current strategy isn't working now, let it go and try something else. It's better to shift your focus than to set yourself up for failure. Seeing reality as it is can save you from further headaches down the road. Hang in there; it's always darkest just before the dawn."
gemini,2015-04-07,"Although you naturally play well with others, good intentions might not be sufficient while your key planet Mercury is in direct conflict with unrelenting Pluto. Today's Mercury-Pluto square impacts your 11th House of Friends, provoking a social meltdown if circumstances push you too far. Instead of cleverly sidestepping confrontation, your current strategy might be to issue an ultimatum to someone who oversteps your boundaries. Avoid taking an extreme position now; thankfully, people will listen to what you're saying if your delivery is calm and sincere."
cancer,2015-04-07,"You may need to stand up to a powerful person today, even if you prefer to remain silent and go about your business. However, it's easier to express your feelings now, especially if you believe you have exhausted all other options. You could be required to take a leap of faith to initiate a difficult conversation, but surprisingly, the discussion rolls along smoothly once you begin. There's no need to be ashamed of your emotions, even if you're worried about how others might respond. Speak directly from your heart without letting endless analysis get between you and your truth."
leo,2015-04-07,"Finding the confidence you need to make progress is currently challenging because people who are usually on your side might now be playing for the other team. But don't let self-doubt drain your energy even if someone appears to be covertly working against your best interests. It may be tempting to engage in verbal conflict today, especially if it gives you a chance to clear the air. Nevertheless, it's wiser to focus on generating positive vibes rather than fueling anyone's negativity. Shine, baby, shine."
virgo,2015-04-07,"You are tempted to pull out all the stops and tell your current nemesis exactly what you think today but, unfortunately, this kind of confrontation won't likely lead to a happy ending. It's more efficient to take the moral high road without stressing over the obvious conflict. Your ruling planet Mercury creates a dynamic square with overbearing Pluto now, raising the existing stakes on even the smallest disagreement. However, striving for an altruistic goal makes much more sense than arguing over something that won't ultimately matter. Establishing common ground cultivates an atmosphere of mutual respect."
libra,2015-04-07,"The single most important thing you can do today is to listen to your heart rather than your head. Unfortunately, behavior based on emotions can produce stress that is triggered by other people's lack of sensitivity. However, it's much easier to engage in an awkward interaction if you concentrate on creating positive possibilities instead of worrying about the potential negative consequences. Integrating pieces of your inner world into the discussion enables you to gain control over issues that you once thought were too overwhelming to confront."
scorpio,2015-04-07,"You are not afraid of tough introspection, but you can get so wrapped up in your thoughts that you withdraw from the rest of the world. Your key planet Pluto represents the intensity of feelings that are lost in the depths of your subconscious mind. However, a square to Pluto from messenger Mercury sends you on a journey within and shines the light of your awareness on an undeniable fact. Don't try to avoid a painful issue, especially while the Moon is camped out in your provocative sign. Make time for a conversation with someone you trust because a weight will lift off your shoulders once a well-kept secret is out in the open."
sagittarius,2015-04-07,"You may experience fruitful progress today, even if you have valid concerns about the bottom line. Although you might not have an unexpected flash of cosmic illumination, you can still explore a facet of yourself that's been previously hidden from your view. Don't casually brush aside what you don't want to see or hear. No matter where it comes from, this inspirational message sparks a deep-seated transformation which ultimately releases you from unnecessary self-limitations. The truth will set you free."
capricorn,2015-04-07,"A dramatic metamorphosis that is already in motion is still shifting the direction of your life. Perceptive Mercury's square to Pluto in your sign highlights one of the many pressing issues you must now face. Someone's sarcastic comment could push your emotional buttons, prompting you to escalate a minor disagreement into a significant conflict. Thankfully, you have a choice and can respond with consciousness rather than denial. You don't need to succumb to negativity today; create an action plan that's based on love instead of fear."
aquarius,2015-04-07,"Sometimes you can derive emotional security from what isn't said between friends, but you may reach your limit with keeping quiet today. You might feel pushed to speak your mind without concern for whatever follows, even if you haven't yet considered all the possible consequences. Nevertheless, don't worry if a simple discussion becomes heated and more complicated than you expected. Stick with it; the emotions should eventually settle back down, leaving the relationship better off because of your well-meaning efforts. Nothing ventured, nothing gained when it comes to matters of the heart."
pisces,2015-04-07,"Your prevailing hopes and dreams of your future aren't immune to change just because you think you know exactly where you are heading. However, you may have already started an unconscious reevaluation of your core beliefs. An unexpected encounter with a friend or associate today could initiate a fundamental shift in the direction of your life path. There's no escape; as your values continue to morph, you will need to reassess your long-term goals and reconsider where you want this journey to take you. Embrace the unknown."
aries,2015-04-08,"You love surprises on a day like today, even if your plans fall apart. Change is so exhilarating that you don't really care what happens next as long as you are in charge. However, it's wise to consider a gentler approach to life because you could scare others away with your overzealous attitude. Nevertheless, communicator Mercury's hook-up with innovative Uranus enables you to be brilliant if you don't push too hard. Thankfully, you can still get what you need without offending anyone if you just stop and consider all of the ramifications before jumping in."
taurus,2015-04-08,"Your originality is abundant today and you're itching to share your ideas with a trustworthy ally because you want honest feedback. You might even arrange an impromptu gathering just so you can kick your plans around with friends. However, it's not your style to express your thoughts and then move on; you prefer to stick to one concept and follow it to its logical conclusion. Whatever you do, don't get in the way of your process; just let your mind take you on a thrilling ride without worrying about where it will end."
gemini,2015-04-08,You don't need an extra shot of espresso today because staying alert is typically not your problem. Your real challenge is to calm your thinking so you don't spend all your energy trying to keep pace with your own thoughts. You are able to accomplish much more if you slow down enough so everyone can understand your message. Choose your words with care and you'll impress others with your ingenious ideas and warm sense of humor.
cancer,2015-04-08,"Conversations at work may not go as expected today, but they end up stimulating your imagination anyway. You are eager to explore uncharted intellectual territory now because you believe new ideas can open the doors along your path to success. In fact, you're willing to leap to conclusions to get the answers to your current questions. However, mental gymnastics are not your best strategy; cool your jets and follow the map instead of traveling via warp drive. Sitting back and enjoying the entertaining energetic buzz might just lead to the breakthrough you need."
leo,2015-04-08,"You might excuse yourself from a social event today so you can retreat into your wild imagination. However, you're not looking to escape into your fantasies as much as you want to visualize your options for the future. Your mind may be focused on an upcoming trip or perhaps you're interested in continuing your education. Thankfully, you'll feel good about going off on your own if you come back with a concrete plan to share with your friends. An innovative leader produces tangible results."
virgo,2015-04-08,"You may be required to pay an emotional price for intimacy yet you're resistant to come up with the entrance fee. However, you are in for a shock now, because the cost is not what you expect. You don't have to sacrifice anything, nor must you let someone else control your destiny. All you need to do is to express your true feelings. If you let others know your concerns sooner than later, they might be more than willing to meet you halfway. Opening your heart isn't always easy but the potential rewards make the effort worthwhile."
libra,2015-04-08,"Your thoughts are loudly reverberating in your head now, leaving you with an anxious feeling in the pit of your stomach. Unfortunately, your high-strung nervous system isn't necessarily in tune with a friend or lover who thinks differently than you do. Ultimately, responding spontaneously without trying to make sense of everything in the moment is key. Combining rational ideas with irrational feelings leads you to discover new ways of interacting with those you love. There's no right or wrong when it comes to matters of the heart."
scorpio,2015-04-08,"Nearly everyone you meet has something fascinating to share, distracting you from your regular responsibilities today. You are actually quite receptive to radical ideas and unconventional experiences. In fact, you are so eager to express yourself in a nonconformist way now that you don't bother to think about the consequences before pursuing your inspiration. It's tempting to believe you can catch up on fulfilling your obligations later; however, procrastination is not your friend. Honoring your promises is almost as important as following your bliss."
sagittarius,2015-04-08,"Your brainwaves are running amok today and you could work yourself into a state of high anxiety if you can't settle down enough to pick a single path. You may feel as if you're wired for surround sound and you're tempted to play several of your favorite songs simultaneously. Instead of trying to tune into one channel at a time, just enjoy listening to the complex mix, regardless of the opinions of others. Even if your unorthodox method doesn't seem to make sense now, you should be able to untangle all the information after the fact. One person's cacophony is another person's symphony."
capricorn,2015-04-08,"Sorting out your priorities can be quite a challenge today because your calculated logic takes you into new and unfamiliar territory. You might feel disconnected from reality now and out of touch with your feelings. But don't let on if you're mystified when others claim they can't understand your behavior. Instead, take plenty of deep breaths and try to keep your feet on the ground, even if it seems like you're being transported into another dimension. Be gentle with yourself as you embark on this magic carpet ride; it could take a few days before your imagination returns to earth."
aquarius,2015-04-08,"A friend or an acquaintance might say something shocking today, revealing information that suddenly alters your perspective. You may have grown overly comfortable with your point of view about a work-related issue only to suddenly realize that you were completely wrong. Personal interactions grow very intense because you believe your emotional security is at stake now. Luckily, the drama begins to dissipate almost as quickly as it started, bringing fresh clarity to the situation. The crazier things seem, the more patience you need to possess."
pisces,2015-04-08,"The emotional seas grow a bit choppy today, but you still can sail through the day with flying colors. Your nervous energy might prompt you to share your excitement before you fully develop an interesting idea. You could start talking with a specific thought in mind, only to shift directions in the middle of a sentence. Although normally it's wise to rehearse your speech, it's actually better to improvise as you go now. Stop trying so hard to say the right thing; you may be pleasantly surprised where your free association leads. Your vivid imagination is your not-so-secret weapon."
aries,2015-04-09,"You might believe that you can zip through your day without encountering any problems at all, but it won't take long for your imagination to run into reality. Luckily, it will take more than a minor setback to eat away at your confidence. Unfortunately, having a brilliant idea doesn't mean you can turn it into a successful plan unless you're committed to giving it hundred percent. Nevertheless, creative pursuits can be the source of great pleasure now if you're willing to work within the scope of your current limitations."
taurus,2015-04-09,"Your previous responsibilities take precedence over everything else today, so don't take on more chores unless it's absolutely necessary. If you promise to do something simply because of social or family pressure, you may end up regretting ever saying yes. However, everything should fall into place if your heart is fully engaged -- even if it's a struggle at the beginning. Don't bother trying to assess your progress for several days; paradoxically, your short-term prognosis improves if you just concentrate on the long-term picture."
gemini,2015-04-09,"Focusing on relationships is top priority now that the evocative Moon is visiting your 7th House of Partners. The adventurous Sagittarius Moon might inspire you to set lofty goals, especially if you encounter someone who embodies the spirit of big thinking. Nevertheless, don't get so excited about a project that you inflate each other's expectations. Unfortunately, dreams are less useful if they're impossible to reach. Sharing your enthusiasm is a great place to start as long as you also have a practical plan in mind."
cancer,2015-04-09,"You start the day believing you can finish everything you start without realizing that the Moon's short stay in your 6th House of Employment could actually double your workload. Unfortunately, you might be very impractical with your optimistic assessment today. Luckily, amazing friends come to your rescue when you need it the most. But leaning on them too much isn't a great idea now since they may not be as reliable as you expect. Demonstrate your self-sufficiency by rising to the challenges of the day with a positive attitude."
leo,2015-04-09,"Your friends may be moving too quickly for your liking today. It's not that you can't keep up with them; it's just that you are bored of engaging in clever conversations or trivial pursuits without anything meaningful to show for the time spent. Unfortunately, going along with the group can backfire now, prompting you to express your dissatisfaction. Balancing your blunt words with a little sensitivity is wise since you don't fully realize the power of your message. In any event, you might have to fly solo at some point if you want to follow your heart."
virgo,2015-04-09,"Your optimistic expectations won't guarantee that people will deliver exactly what you want. It might even be your boss or someone in power that lets you down today. Although you are quick to sort out the complex dynamics, it's still challenging to let go of your previous expectations. Distance yourself from disappointment by remembering that the actions of others are beyond your control. The good news is that you can always change your response. Satisfaction ultimately comes from within."
libra,2015-04-09,"A current relationship may hit a speed bump today when it becomes apparent that you each want something different. Even if you both talk about compromise, neither of you are in the mood to negotiate now. Unfortunately, it's tough to sustain a heart connection while you are disagreeing about basic values. Don't make matters worse by trying to force a resolution where there is none. Sometimes a gentle nudge in the right direction works better than anything else. If you both take a step toward the middle, you will be standing on common ground before you know it."
scorpio,2015-04-09,"A coworker's erratic behavior today may be enough to drive you to the edge of crazy. Although a friend is only trying to offer support, everyone's solutions are so far off target that enlisting assistance is not worth the effort. You might be left feeling like no one truly understands your needs now. Don't bother trying to justify what you want; just retreat long enough to find your center of gravity and then try again. The courageous Sagittarius Moon motivates you to get back on your feet once you realize that you're the only one in control of your destiny."
sagittarius,2015-04-09,"You wish you could set logic aside to chase your dreams, but it's smarter to use any tools available now to resist the temptation to overreact to every single whim. The Moon's current visit to your enthusiastic sign might be overwhelming if you are flooded with contradictory emotional messages. Instead of responding irrationally, carefully observe your changing moods until they reveal a larger theme. Being patient with your process allows you to honor your feelings while also acting in a responsible manner."
capricorn,2015-04-09,"The pursuit of love won't be very satisfying today if an unobtainable goal leads you around like a carrot on a stick. You could waste precious time running down an unreachable dream if you don't pay attention to the bigger picture, too. However, the world becomes a friendlier place when your heart is aligned with the messages you are sending others. You don't have to lower your standards, but you can't expect perfection when it comes to relationships."
aquarius,2015-04-09,"You need to socialize today because your connections with others nurture your soul. However, previous commitments require so much energy that you might not have enough time to cultivate your friendships. Your quiet frustration could morph into anger, but there doesn't seem to be any sensible outlet for your emotions now. In spite of your current longing to be with the ones you love, a temporary retreat could be all that's needed to shift the dynamics in a positive direction."
pisces,2015-04-09,"Professional demands require logical planning, yet your heart's wishes could get left out of the equation today. You water-loving Fish may feel as if you have been suddenly dropped off in the desert with no way home. Nevertheless, there is a significant flurry of activity in your life now, and your individual desires might have to be put on hold so you can manage the complexity of your job. This uneasy state of emotional suppression is temporary; give it a few days to see where your current strategy leads before giving up hope. Let your intuition work its magic and all will be fine."
aries,2015-04-10,"Your nerves are on edge, heightening your awareness of the excitement in your life now. Fortunately, you also realize you must maintain your cool at all costs if you want to earn the respect of others. No matter how impatient you are today, it's crucial to filter out some of your most radical ideas so you can effectively make your point. Taking an innovative approach is still your best option, but keep in mind that the world is relying on you to show up in a responsible manner."
taurus,2015-04-10,"You don't like being perceived as the most predictable person now, prompting you to shock others with your erratic behavior. You might become so bored with your own thoughts today that you go out of your way to stir up trouble. People may be surprised, but it is these same old expectations that you are trying to rattle. Keep in mind that there's no need to overcompensate when stating your case; you gain nothing by going to extremes to demonstrate your individuality. Being your authentic self is more convincing than anything else."
gemini,2015-04-10,"Saying outrageous things today can act like a lightning rod, attracting attention wherever you go. Of course, you're naturally clever, but now you are more likely to make waves in order to elicit a strong response. Unfortunately, your reckless behavior could provoke emotions that are more intense than you want to handle. Thankfully, you don't have to share every crazy idea that crosses your mind. Your mysterious smile keeps everyone guessing until you're ready to reveal your secrets."
cancer,2015-04-10,"You might believe you can avoid a powerful emotional confrontation now by consistently bringing the conversation back to the known facts. It isn't that you're trying to slip into denial; you just don't want to be overwhelmed by a topic that you can't easily manage. Thankfully, you can establish clear boundaries today without creating any unnecessary drama. Avoid the temptation to write the end of the story before you get there in real life."
leo,2015-04-10,You are so plugged in today that you're hyperaware of the dissonance between your inner and outer worlds. You understand what is appropriate now and can easily navigate a situation without bringing your own psychological process into the mix. Keeping conversations simple is the right strategy. You will be less likely to open a can of worms if you say fewer words. Silence really is golden when you prefer to be left alone to your own devices.
virgo,2015-04-10,"Normally, you possess the enviable skill to singularly focus on your thoughts, even while in a situation that is chock full of distractions. However, it isn't as simple to stay on track today because sharing your ideas requires time and energy that you don't have to waste. Nevertheless, don't try to shut down this exciting intellectual current or you'll just end up frustrated by a lost opportunity. It's not an all-or-nothing proposition. Listen to your inner voice, but keep returning to center yourself in between your little mental excursions."
libra,2015-04-10,"Glimmers of thrilling experiences flash in and out of view today, while remaining just beyond your reach. You could wind up disheartened if you mistakenly believe you can make a fantasy real now. However, you get the best of both worlds by allowing your colorful images to come and go without attempting to pull them in or push them away. Balancing each impulse with an equal dose of realism enables you to manifest more of your dreams than you ever imagined."
scorpio,2015-04-10,"Your special gift today is your ability to talk about an awkward subject in a way that's palatable for people to handle. For once, you aren't called upon to play the role of a heavyweight to make your point. Your friends appreciate your direct honesty as long as they don't feel unfairly blamed in the process. If something needs to be said now, go ahead and say it. Just be succinct and take full responsibility for your feelings. Your catalytic words may be more healing in nature than you realize as long as you speak from your heart."
sagittarius,2015-04-10,"You may feel emotionally constricted today, as if your heart was a snake that is outgrowing its skin. Your strategy might be to patiently hold still, since one big breath is all that's needed to shed your old exterior. Proceed with caution, since an internal voice could be counseling you to go ahead and break through whatever restraints are impeding your personal evolution. Nevertheless, tread carefully; don't do anything you might regret. Transformation doesn't happen overnight."
capricorn,2015-04-10,"You are lost in your thoughts today as the Moon returns to your serious sign for a short visit. But you're not content to just spend this time in quiet contemplation of your feelings. You want to consider all your options, set new goals, figure out your best route and get started. Just remember that your current intentions carry more weight than you know. Keep the faith and continue on your path; you may be quite surprised with your progress in just a few days."
aquarius,2015-04-10,"You might be caught in the middle of an internal tug-of-war now with your anticipation luring you into the future and your fear of change pulling you back into the past. Naturally, you lean toward anticipating whatever is ahead, but your thoughts continue to anchor you to the present. Even if you can't fully justify your actions with logic, taking a calculated risk is better than letting the moment pass without doing anything at all. Looking before you leap is a smart idea as long as you go ahead and leap."
pisces,2015-04-10,"You gain invaluable strength from your social interactions today, for your peers seem to have the common sense that you currently lack. You may believe that you have already tried the obvious ways to resolve an existing problem and are now ready to accept an out-of-the-box approach. However, you could destabilize your day if you just act out of desperation. Take the time to talk things over with a friend; an additional perspective might be all you need to regain your clarity."
aries,2015-04-11,"It feels as if the world is your playground today with so many fascinating ways to spend your time. However, you may grow resentful if you can't escape your responsibilities long enough to chase more pleasurable pursuits. Nevertheless, anyone who stands in your path to possible happiness might become the easy target for your negativity. Fortunately, you're better able to compromise once you acknowledge that your desires are on the extreme side now. You can't always live in the moment; personal fulfillment comes from balancing your need for immediate gratification with your respect for promises already made."
taurus,2015-04-11,"Your finances could become a trouble spot if you lose touch with your common sense while your key planet Venus is moving through your 2nd House of Money. You might not be able to stretch your cash far enough to enjoy all the luxuries you think you deserve now. If you just say yes to your current self-indulgence, you may end up worrying that you can't afford your grand adventure. However, scaling back your plans prior to making a commitment today can be your ticket to success. Being practical before the fact is wiser than confronting reality once you're already in motion."
gemini,2015-04-11,"Unspoken demands may prevent you from wandering off in search of pleasure today, even though romantic Venus is making herself comfortable in your versatile sign. You are in your element, but someone's unrealistic expectations complicate your life when vulnerable Venus runs into possessive Pluto. No matter what kind of relationship complexities you must face now, honestly addressing each situation separately as it arises makes the overall drama easier to handle in the long run. Engaging in every dance in the present moment turns a difficult process into a magical one."
cancer,2015-04-11,"You're unsure of what you want now that Venus is hiding out in your 12th House of Fantasy. Even if your thoughts are hard to ignore, you won't likely share them with anyone today, especially if you believe that your words might be used against you. Although your suspicions protect you from getting hurt, they also prevent you from receiving love. Don't be so quick to think you can read people's motives. Remain open to support even if it doesn't arrive in the manner you expect. Allow others to show you the same compassion that you have given them in the past."
leo,2015-04-11,"You can rationalize doing things your own way, yet you also accept the importance of adhering to the rules of the game. Sometimes it's challenging to operate without a plan because your fear of losing of control makes you uneasy. However, flying by the seat of your pants works in your favor now. It may be scary to make everything up as you go along, but your current adaptability enables you to take advantage of each new moment as it arises. As Blake wrote, ""He who kisses the joy as it flies, lives in eternity's sunrise."""
virgo,2015-04-11,"Following your predetermined path may be perplexing now because you're being shown several different roads that lead to your desired destination. Pleasure-seeking Venus enters fickle Gemini today, presenting you with more options than you want. Unfortunately, you can lose sight of your initial goal if you spend too much time wondering if any one route is more efficient than the others. Thankfully, your dreams will be within reach once you accept that moving forward is more important than finding all of the answers to your questions."
libra,2015-04-11,"Your vision of the future begins to take shape now that you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. The presence of resourceful Venus in your 9th House of Big Ideas reveals new ways to explore your feelings as relationships become more of an adventure than a responsibility. But don't fall into the trap of engaging in endless philosophical discussions about the meaning of love. Sit back and enjoy the show while your mind goes through the motions of justifying your desires. If you let the process run its proper course, you will live your dream instead of just thinking about it."
scorpio,2015-04-11,"Instead of impulsively overreacting to a changing environment, you prefer taking time to contemplate a more measured response. However, don't worry if you are required to shoot from the hip today; you have the skills necessary to aim with precision. You might wish that everything was more mapped out now, but you need to be ready to fill in the details as the power dynamics of a relationship shift. Remember, a significant opportunity could be squandered if you aren't willing to be flexible. He who hesitates is lost."
sagittarius,2015-04-11,"You are more than willing to give nearly anyone the benefit of the doubt now that friendly Venus is camping out in your 7th House of Relationships. Luckily, you feel no need to fight back to reclaim your equilibrium if someone knocks you out of emotional balance today. It's wiser to analyze your anxiety without attempting to shift blame to anyone else. Your sense of self-worth is not dependent on external circumstances but comes from your internal frame of mind. Loving others starts with loving yourself."
capricorn,2015-04-11,"You're resigned to do whatever is expected of you today to make a relationship work. However, magnetic Venus crosses paths with the evocative Moon and passionate Pluto, stirring up emotional conflict with a stubborn opponent. You might feel as if you're being provoked, but once you move beyond your fears you begin to see silver linings instead of dark clouds. Remaining open to change could be enough to bring more balance into your life. As scary as it sounds, the more vulnerable you're willing to be now, the greater the rewards."
aquarius,2015-04-11,"You feel lighter on your feet now that vivacious Venus is skipping her way through flirty Gemini. Although you can charm a potential adversary with your killer smile and your quick wit, your thoughts could be moving so fast that you blurt out the wrong thing. Unfortunately, you can't take your words back if you cross over the line of etiquette, so don't waste energy trying to fix a verbal misstep. Simply apologize for your social blunder and move on. If you acknowledge your shortcomings with an equal dose of humility and humor, others will be more than happy to forgive and forget."
pisces,2015-04-11,"Reminiscing about your past feels reassuring while romantic Venus is traveling through your 4th House of Roots, but your storytelling may not have the same nostalgic effect on others you had planned on. What seems like a casual disclosure to a trusted companion could create a totally unexpected impact today, unleashing an emotional chain of reactions. Nevertheless, nothing is gained by avoiding the intensity; plug into the powerful connection with no expectations and an open heart."
aries,2015-04-12,"Your secret weapon today is faith, and you might actually be able to manifest a dream if you believe in it strongly enough. However, even the slightest bit of doubt could be enough to let your goal slip through your fingers and disappear back into your imagination. When energetic Mars blends its fiery convictions with the magic touch of otherworldly Neptune, others may see you as a benevolent wizard. But there's no trickery involved; it's only the laws of nature cooperating with your powerful intuition. Your job is to believe in yourself and dance to the music you hear in your heart."
taurus,2015-04-12,"You might think that you have all your bases covered with your mastery of details today, but it's easy to skip over a critical fact if you're only concentrating on winning the game. People appreciate your sincerity, even in the most casual interactions, so you don't have to oversell your ideas to make your point. It's fine to see yourself as a teacher who is sharing your vision of tomorrow but just don't get so caught up in your imagination that you float off into space. You perform at your best when your feet remain firmly planted on solid ground."
gemini,2015-04-12,"You enjoy having the freedom to improvise, but sometimes it's challenging to act spontaneously when people's expectations require you to show up in a responsible manner. You might want to push back against authority now, but you could wear yourself out in the process. Instead, meet your obligations while still coloring outside of the lines in your imagination. This dual path is like a training exercise that helps you develop your ability to be in two places at once. Practicing self-discipline amps up your creative genius, prompting you to grow in more ways than you realize."
cancer,2015-04-12,"Balancing your emotional needs with those of others can be tricky today as the Moon shifts from your 7th House of Partnerships into your 8th House of Deep Sharing. It's in your nature to be a caregiver, but you must also establish clear limits now or you'll lose your center of gravity. Unfortunately, this process isn't straightforward; a simple yes or no answer on your part may not work. Things are not exactly as they appear, so explore a wide spectrum of possibilities between the extremes. There's magic to be discovered in the gray that's between the black and the white."
leo,2015-04-12,"Although an interaction with a close friend could take an unexpected detour today, it might turn into a wonderful experience if you don't try to control the outcome. You may approach a situation with enthusiasm based on the belief that your desires will be fulfilled. However, pursuing your original fantasy leads to unhappiness if circumstances change. But don't think that your agenda is the only one that matters. Your openness to experimenting with something completely different is the missing ingredient to creating a bit of magic in your relationship."
virgo,2015-04-12,"Your innate sense of discrimination sets the stage for creative activities today by screening out extraneous distractions. Starting early improves your chances of expressing your imagination while still producing tangible results. But you grow more set in your ways as the day unfolds, leaving less room for playful exploration. Let go of your need for perfection; it's less important to achieve your goals now than it is to have fun. You can still learn a valuable lesson if you have the courage to take a risk and reveal your heart."
libra,2015-04-12,"You might have idealistic visions about your future, but your chance of manifesting your dreams mostly depends on your attitude. It's easy to be distracted by every pleasant thought that pulls you one way and then another. Too much flexibility leaves you blowing in the wind with nothing substantial to show for your work at the end of the day. However, concentrating on a singular destination empowers you to get the most out of this cosmically spiritual day. You can cultivate a whim by feeding it with your undivided focus until it grows into an established plan. Where your attention goes, energy flows."
scorpio,2015-04-12,"You may find it nearly impossible to get others to understand your intentions unless you take the time to cover every detail step by step. Fortunately, you can explain your position effectively as long as you don't rush the process of telling your story. There's no reason to just stick to the facts; you can enthrall your audience if you weave in material from your imagination. It's not about misleading anyone; it's only about enhancing your presentation. As Eleanor Roosevelt said, ""The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams."""
sagittarius,2015-04-12,"You wish you had the luxury of ignoring your financial responsibilities, but pressing issues require your immediate attention. The Moon's weekend visit to your 2nd House of Resources reminds you that managing your money is actually a matter of self-respect. Taking control of your budget today means you might actually end up with more cash to spend than you originally imagined. But solutions won't occur in a momentary flash of awareness; you must believe wholeheartedly in the manifestation process. Be patient; doing less is wiser now than doing too much."
capricorn,2015-04-12,"Sometimes you are an enigma, even to your closest friends. You seem so determined to reach your goals but your methodical approach is misleading because you're not as serious as people think. Your conservative mask may hide a merry prankster as you go about your chores today. However, you don't need to keep up appearances; in fact, the more you express your inner child now, the younger you feel. Let down your guard; others will appreciate seeing your more playful side."
aquarius,2015-04-12,"Your powers of observation are strong today, as long as you trust your instincts. However, there's no need to worry about every little thing if you focus on your vision of the future. Stepping back from your regular routine now allows you to gain a wider perspective on your life. But don't think you're in it alone as you reassess your goals. Ask for help; wisdom might come from someone who you consider to be a valuable mentor if you're willing to admit you don't have all of the answers."
pisces,2015-04-12,"You often exhibit more compassion for others than you do for yourself. Fortunately, you can be a wonderful friend for those you want to get to know better today, and they quickly learn to rely on your kind heart and keen intuition. Just remember that some of the emotional difficulties you are still processing are also your most powerful sources of insights now. Integrating your own experiences into the present moment empowers you to communicate with more conviction. The care and feeding of those you love starts at home with yourself."
aries,2015-04-13,It doesn't matter how altruistic your intentions are today; you may be so preoccupied with your own needs that you hurt someone's feelings without even realizing it. Just because your agenda makes logical sense to you doesn't mean that anyone else will share your perspective. Reconsider your options before doing something that you might quickly regret. Talking about your plans with those you trust helps in more ways than one. Harnessing your enthusiasm for the good of all is your best bet.
taurus,2015-04-13,"Even if you are extremely cautious about expressing your desires, you still could set common sense aside and, in a flash, tell someone exactly what you want. Unfortunately, your disclosure may be a case of sharing too much information too quickly. Your agreeable nature is challenged now by unconventional Uranus' anxious connection to creative Venus. Although you might want to walk on the wild side today, it doesn't mean that others will join you. If your heart is set on a particular path, be prepared to go it alone."
gemini,2015-04-13,"You might be out to have some innocent fun today, but others may see your behavior as unnecessarily contrary to the group mind. Your unique expression of individuality makes you appear argumentative now, but you can't worry about the reactions of others, especially if they seem to take offense with nearly everything you do. Consider the consequences before you cross the line of good taste. Respecting everyone's boundaries is the first step to establishing an atmosphere of trust."
cancer,2015-04-13,"Nearly everyone seems to be busy enjoying the day, yet you're challenged with a familiar dilemma. You're being asked to choose between taking a conservative path into the future or making radical changes that can turn your life upside down. Although you are eager to find an original solution, it's not easy to let go of your current emotional security. Thankfully, your actions won't need to be as disruptive as you think. Small changes today will have larger ramifications sooner than you expect."
leo,2015-04-13,"Acting with moderation isn't always the easiest course of action for you. Your unrelenting desire for drama could unleash more emotional instability than you prefer today. You simply can't comprehend why you need to curtail your desire for fun and you're eager to involve others in your plans. Unfortunately, more is not always better. The smartest advice you can heed now is to decide on your limits before you sail past them. When it comes to indulgence, a little goes a long way."
virgo,2015-04-13,"Sharing every feeling may not be the smartest thing to do today because you could shock and awe others with your true desires. Surprising someone by asking for what you want isn't the worst thing in the world, but your intentions could certainly be misunderstood. Oddly enough, even your warm smile might be misinterpreted as too flirtatious. You don't think you're being pushy, but your current intensity can make people uncomfortable. Taking a gentler approach all around improves the odds of making an authentic connection."
libra,2015-04-13,"Unexpected opportunities for pleasure seem to appear out of nowhere, but they may destabilize your relationships now that electrical Uranus is zapping your personal life. You can't be sure what to expect today because people aren't following your script. Nevertheless, it could be an exciting adventure to go on a ride when you don't know where it will take you. Although the adrenaline rush has you soaring to new dimensions, make sure you know how and when to return to Earth."
scorpio,2015-04-13,"You speak with the power of your convictions behind everything you say now. Your unique originality may be a lot more persuasive than you realize, so make sure you know when to ease up with your demands. If you sound too insistent today, you could ruin your chances for success. However, practicing flexibility and patience enables you to make the progress you desire. Ultimately, your integrity shines through your actions rather than your words."
sagittarius,2015-04-13,"Your hopes loom so large now that you might believe you can reach out and touch your dreams. However, nearly everything seems exaggerated these days, making it difficult to gauge the relative importance of your goals. Your current enthusiasm distorts your objectivity and clouds your common sense. If something looks extremely enticing today, wait a day or two before making any final decisions. It's healthier to make a significant commitment only after giving it serious thought."
capricorn,2015-04-13,"Your eyes grow wide with excitement as you imagine the fun-filled activities before you. However, you may have trouble letting your guard down because you can see that life will soon be serious again. You want to cut loose but you can't shake the annoying feeling that you should be doing something more to get ready for the demands ahead. In fact, it might be too late to do any additional preparation. The best use of your time now is to follow your bliss; recharge your batteries while you still have the chance."
aquarius,2015-04-13,"A sudden turn of events could brighten your day in a way that's totally unexpected. Nevertheless, your future will be decided by your response to this surprising twist of fate. Your adaptability reduces the complexity while an overly rigid attitude only complicates your journey ahead. Sweet Venus anxiously aligns with independent Uranus today, turning up the volume on your desires. Although you may have a tricky time balancing all the variables, don't miss this exciting opportunity to dance with the unknown."
pisces,2015-04-13,"You are tempted to head off toward the horizon today before you even know your destination. Sexy Venus is currently flirting with wild Uranus, giving you green lights everywhere you look. Unfortunately, circumstances could change instantaneously if you don't stay aware of your immediate surroundings. Avoid any unpleasant surprises by focusing on the present moment throughout the entire day, instead of drifting off into dreams of the future. Have faith in the power of now."
aries,2015-04-14,"You might think you have a handle on the events of the day, but you're most likely viewing reality through rose-colored glasses. Your absolute certainty is misleading to people who take your words at face value. Although the facts are foggy, your intuition is strong today. Be fair to all parties involved by acknowledging your temporary disorientation before creating any unnecessary discord. Your happiness depends on your ability to be honest with everyone now, especially yourself."
taurus,2015-04-14,"You're concerned about losing your pragmatic approach to finances now or misplacing your good judgment about meeting responsibilities. Although you attempt to compensate for the fact that your perspective is a bit wonky today, you still might not make the best choices. Fuzzy thinking weakens your position, so steer clear of unnecessary debates. Putting off significant decisions for a few days is wise because you need additional time to redefine your goals. In the meantime, let your dreams inspire your creativity without worrying about the logistics."
gemini,2015-04-14,"Your colorful imagination is running on overdrive today; every separate event triggers cascades of otherworldly fantasies. Enjoy the mental picture show, but be careful of becoming so enchanted by your visions that you begin to believe your flights of fancy are real. There's no reason to stop daydreaming now, but you can simplify your life by keeping the images to yourself. Words fail to describe your fanciful escapades; some things are better left unsaid."
cancer,2015-04-14,"You could mistakenly conclude that your project is ready for launch if you receive approval from someone in authority. But a close friend may complicate your life by trying to change your mind while you're in the middle of putting your plan into motion. Unfortunately, others can't understand how deeply your confusion runs now, especially if you hide your concerns. Don't make waves until you're more confident about where you stand. Reveal your new and improved proposal only after you've had a chance to develop your best ideas behind the scenes for another day or two."
leo,2015-04-14,"People may seem a bit spacey today, but their vagueness actually says more about you than them. Although you are working diligently these days to gain clarity in your life, the truth still seems elusive. Nevertheless, you tend to overcompensate by limiting your thinking and reducing your creativity in the process. There's no need to be too judgmental about your lack of focus now; when you become more accepting of yourself, everything else will appear more positive, too. Letting your inner artist out to play inspires others to do the same."
virgo,2015-04-14,"You may feel befuddled as you go about your chores today since you're struggling to define your current role at work. Even if you have established routines, your job is changing in ways that are difficult to understand. Instead of wasting time listing all the pros and cons of your situation, drop the analysis and follow your intuition instead. There's no point in making a commitment until you are more certain about your professional path. For now, simply showing up and doing what's expected of you produces the best results."
libra,2015-04-14,"Although you might wake up with a specific agenda, you may shift directions as the day unfolds. Trying to maintain your focus grows increasingly complicated today and can ultimately lead to frustration unless you're willing to reassess your goals and reinvent your strategy. However, even if you're able to see into the future now, wait a few days until your feet are back on the ground before implementing anything new. Working with the cosmic energy is easier than trying to fight against it."
scorpio,2015-04-14,"You prefer to keep the wheels of progress turning today because you're secretly second-guessing a recent decision and don't want anyone to know. Your best friends might not even notice your anxiety, especially if you believe that you're doing them a favor by withholding your concerns. After all, sharing your feelings now would only complicate matters more. But blaming others for a lack of support won't accomplish anything unless you disclose more of your emotional process. Confiding in a trustworthy friend could ease your mind more than you think."
sagittarius,2015-04-14,"You're quite sentimental about your memories today as a conversation with someone special reminds you of a nearly forgotten past event. However, meandering about in nostalgic recollections brings only fleeting satisfaction, so you might want to switch the focus to creating positive change in a current relationship. Think before you speak, and be careful that your outspoken approach doesn't produce unnecessary hurt in the present moment. Ultimately, letting go of the past allows you to move freely into the future."
capricorn,2015-04-14,"An emotionally revealing discussion with a close friend can fill your heart with joy today. Normally, you're attracted to constructive conversations that can help you along the path of personal and professional growth. But now you're more interested in sharing your feelings with someone who won't judge everything you say. There's no reason to feel guilty about your desire to escape from reality. Even you hardworking Goats deserve a chance to frolic in the field of dreams."
aquarius,2015-04-14,"Expressing your needs clearly isn't as simple as it sounds today because your desires are bouncing all over the place. Unfortunately, once you start talking you display a wide range of emotions, challenging others to keep up with your mood swings. Nevertheless, a more thoughtful approach enables you to minimize insecurities that arise from a breakdown in communication. Exploring your feelings by writing in a journal is a sensible way to ground yourself now. Take time to ponder your process before you share your heart with anyone else."
pisces,2015-04-14,"You grow more intuitive as the day wears on, but it's crucial to be aware of the difference between your internal signals and what your subconscious is picking up from others. The Moon's shift into your dreamy sign can dissolve the boundaries between you and those in your immediate environment. Someone's inability to comprehend your spiritual approach to life might make you feel insecure. However, it isn't necessary to respond to criticism or accusations; instead, be proud of your innate sensitivity and compassion as they are a big part of what makes you so special."
aries,2015-04-15,"Finding love and keeping it alive isn't just a matter of making a wish and blowing out the candles. The truth is it takes a lot of hard work to make a relationship endure over the long haul. Whether you are single or not, you may feel as if you're on your own now. Initiating communication won't necessarily reignite the passion but it can build a foundation of trust. Although it might feel uncomfortable at first, revealing your vulnerability is the necessary first step to creating a solid emotional bond that survives the tests of time."
taurus,2015-04-15,"A metaphysical idea or a romantic possibility inspires you to race ahead, only to hit a wall before you even ramp up to full speed. However, don't take this setback as a defeat when it's just a helpful reality check that offers you the chance to do even better in the long run. If you pay careful attention to the signs, they will tell you how best to proceed. Chase your dreams with caution now. There's no reason to rush forward; if an opportunity is worth pursuing, slow down and do it right."
gemini,2015-04-15,"Rough terrain can complicate a love affair, revealing the stark reality of a romance. However, there's no avoiding the truth now, so don't try to delay the inevitable, even if it means talking about your feelings. Digging into the emotional landscape requires a commitment of time and energy, but it's the best way to ensure your ultimate satisfaction. Practicing patience isn't always easy for you restless Twins, but connecting with the ones you love is well worth the struggle in the long run."
cancer,2015-04-15,"You might be performing better in the public arena than you are in the romance department, but there are obstacles blocking your way now even at your job. The problem is that your intense feelings aren't solely defined by the facts of the current situation. You know there is a solution just beyond your reach, but you must overcome your own sense of limitations first. Although your answers may not yet be in sight, impossible is just a state of mind. The bottom line is your attitude needs to improve before circumstances can fall into place."
leo,2015-04-15,"Although you prefer to believe that blue skies will follow you wherever you go today, a black cloud appears with your name written all over it. You can't outrun the storm and you certainly can't ignore it, either. You want to remain optimistic about your future, but sooner or later you must accept that your parade could be rained out. Don't take it personally; just get to the work at hand and do the very best job you can. The Sun will come out tomorrow."
virgo,2015-04-15,"Community or work responsibilities may keep you from enjoying quality time with your family or loved ones today. Unfortunately, your idealistic vision of relationships makes it nearly impossible for current circumstances to measure up to your dreams. Instead of comparing reality to your fantasies every step of the way, accept the fact that a wide gulf separates the two now. A simple acknowledgment of the truth might be enough to cut the ties that bind you to your expectations. Once you have abandoned your illusions, you are free to follow your heart."
libra,2015-04-15,"You can be your own worst enemy today, although you could cleverly blame the current circumstances on someone else. Ultimately, whatever drama is occurring in the present moment is your own doing, even if it plays out in the realm of relationships. Thankfully, you're able to turn the tide and improve your lot by taking responsibility for your actions. Use the power that your words have on others now to your advantage. Being calm, cool and collected is admirable, but a sincere apology is worth its weight in gold."
scorpio,2015-04-15,"Although it seems like a serious lack of resources is at the heart of your current dilemma, it's really about your own self-esteem now. Maybe you took an extreme position and are having a tough time integrating the feedback you receive from others. Hold onto your ambitious vision of the future even if your destination seems to be a long way off. Ultimately, the obstacles in your path will not outlast your dreams; believing in yourself is your secret weapon to weathering this storm."
sagittarius,2015-04-15,"You could reach an impasse with a partner now as he or she acts more like a parent than anything else. Recognizing your role in setting up these uncomfortable dynamics is the first step to creating positive change. Perhaps you overlooked something important in your excitement and you need to know about it. Whatever you do, don't shoot the messenger. In fact, the reason someone is being hard on you may be because they love you enough to tell you an inconvenient truth."
capricorn,2015-04-15,"You may need to confront an uncomfortable situation at work today. Obviously, you want to set everything right, but even your extra effort won't likely be sufficient to change the grand scheme of things. However, the real danger is that you can take this turn of events as a personal failure. A temporary setback is not a reflection of your character. Your competence is being tested and the solutions will come from inspiration and vision now, not from perspiration."
aquarius,2015-04-15,"From a cosmic perspective, you're doing exactly what's required. But the current intensity of your idealism is running so strong now that you could face opposition to your most creative ideas. However, the resistance you are encountering is not a sign that you're on the wrong track. The real problem is your cavalier attitude; if someone thinks you're not being serious enough they might want to teach you a lesson. Your smartest strategy is one of cooperation and compromise. You will be happily surprised with your progress once you let go of your preconceived notions and trust the process."
pisces,2015-04-15,"You know you're an emotional softie but you don't want your hypersensitivity to stand in the way of professional progress today. You might jump to the wrong conclusion, assuming you just need to work harder to prove your intelligence. Oddly enough, speeding ahead won't help you reach your goals any quicker, especially if you think you need to suppress your feelings along the way. There are no shortcuts now; focus on your responsibilities and the rest will follow."
aries,2015-04-16,"You might not even be aware that you slipped away from the real world and drifted off into the realms of your imagination. But if you look at everything very closely today, you may notice that things are bent slightly out of shape. A temporary escape into this parallel dimension isn't a problem, but confusing your dreams with reality can create quite a mess. Instead of struggling to discern the truth, explore every idea that floats across your consciousness as if it's the inspiration for your next masterpiece."
taurus,2015-04-16,"Your boss might not be very demonstrative with his or her support of your efforts today, but you keep pushing ahead no matter what. You're confident that you can prove your value if only given the chance. Meanwhile, you could turn into a modern-day Sherlock Holmes, searching for clues to help break down the wall of resistance. Your frustration builds because the closer you get to the truth, the harder it is to find. You won't win any battles using your infamous persistence, so think cooperatively rather than competitively  if you want to move up the ladder of success."
gemini,2015-04-16,"You may share an intriguing idea with someone today because you want a strong and clear response. But rather than receiving a definitive yes or no, you might not be able to tell where the other person stands. There's no reason to overreact since it is all too easy now to misread the signals. And, even if you're certain about the accuracy of your perceptions, keep in mind that everyone's feelings are prone to change these days. Instead of pressing anyone to be more specific, relax your need to know. Letting go of control allows the energy to flow freely and improves your chances of getting the answers later on."
cancer,2015-04-16,"Your vivid daydreams of a faraway destination can make you feel like you're actually there. Unfortunately, you can't reach your exotic paradise immediately in the three-dimensional world and still be home in time for dinner. You could set yourself up for disappointment unless you are fully satisfied by traveling in the mental realms, instead. Why waste time packing your suitcase when indulging in a good fantasy is all you need to recharge your batteries."
leo,2015-04-16,"You have your work cut out for you today, yet you may choose to set it aside to pursue a more creative venture. Don't worry about the unrealistic expectations of others while you are busy running down a dream. If you keep up with your chores, whatever else you do will remain beyond the realm of criticism. Rather than expending energy justifying your actions, show the world what amazing feats you're capable of once you put your mind to something that truly matters."
virgo,2015-04-16,"People have a tough time trying to reason with you today because you believe you already possess all the facts you need to make up your mind. You might say that you're interested in new information as it arrives, but the truth is you keep a very stringent filter on your inbox. But don't lock others out just because you're afraid of what you could learn from them. Engaging in honest conversations -- even with an adversary -- may bring you a much-needed fresh perspective. Keep in mind that nothing is etched in stone yet. Today's decisions could change as soon as tomorrow."
libra,2015-04-16,"You have many tasks on your to-do list today and it's a smart strategy to complete as much as possible before the Moon leaves your 6th House of Work. It is more complicated to return to your schedule once your attention moves on to something more captivating. Don't procrastinate because someone could distract you with their project at any moment, temporarily hijacking your plans. Maintaining your focus will leave you with something significant to show for your efforts at the end of the day. Effective time management is currently your key to success."
scorpio,2015-04-16,"Exciting diversions to your daily routine are like guests being welcomed in for a cup of tea. Although your common sense doesn't approve, you will probably say yes to an invitation that comes your way now even if you don't really have the time to play. Naturally, meeting your obligations remains a high priority, but your overall quality of work could suffer if you don't also give yourself the chance to relax and have fun. Cut yourself some slack; the high expectations you place on yourself will carry you through whatever course you choose."
sagittarius,2015-04-16,"You might experience unexpected stress because of the heavy responsibilities that fall on your shoulders now. However, you're still ready to go out and stir up some mischief, even if there are consequences to pay. Your productivity could slack off today, but you should be able to make up for lost time tomorrow. Give your mind a break and exercise your creativity while you can. All work and no play is not a viable option for you free-spirited Archers."
capricorn,2015-04-16,"You probably won't be able to stick to your previous plans today, and accepting this fact early on in the day could alleviate a lot of unnecessary tension. Your moods are meandering all over the map, making you less likely to follow through on your original agenda. But rather than suppressing your feelings, it's healthier to remain in touch with them. Trying to maintain objectivity could be exhausting and unproductive now. You will feel much better once you give yourself permission to temporarily relinquish control. Let go and allow your heart to lead the way."
aquarius,2015-04-16,"You may receive an important message from someone who is very close to you. Paradoxically, what you are told could be contrary to what you believed you were going to hear. Although this new information complicates your life, you will only make matters worse if you try to block it out. You can't avoid negative consequences by pretending there isn't a problem. Be smart and deal with any issue that surfaces now before it spins out of control. Denial is not your friend; facing the music today saves you from heartaches tomorrow."
pisces,2015-04-16,"You're emotionally unsettled today because you sense something big is about to change. Your feelings are volatile and you can't tell where they are leading you. Unfortunately, attempts to ignore your needs could trigger you to unconsciously act out. Trying to control the energy by limiting your interactions with others only makes you feel lonely. Thankfully, you are a Fish and know that it's easier to swim with the currents instead of resisting the tide. Go with the flow; you can figure out your next move later after you reclaim your center and your creative muse returns."
aries,2015-04-17,"No matter how psyched you are about the changes ahead, something could happen that catches you completely off guard now. Although there's nothing to do in preparation for the unexpected, remember that your mind is exaggerating the significance of everything that happens today. Your positive outlook on life motivates others to accomplish more than they think possible. But everyone can make even more progress if you control your tendency of going to the extremes. Finding the sweet spot between optimism and realism empowers you to skillfully navigate the changing landscape, leading the pack all the way."
taurus,2015-04-17,"You may attempt to downplay your desires because you want everyone to think you're cool under pressure. Nevertheless, you're more than likely to give in to your feelings and throw caution to the wind while excessive Jupiter encourages assertive Mars in your sign. You might even shock someone today with your blunt approach. However, your uncharacteristic boldness is useful for  overcoming any resistance, even if you hadn't previously thought out your strategy. Although you typically like to have a more concrete plan in place, the results could still bring you the satisfaction you seek."
gemini,2015-04-17,"You normally leave the execution of plans to everyone one else while you are busy running around exploring one fascinating idea after another. However, you need to modify your tactics today if people are behaving irresponsibly or advising you to stretch beyond your normal limits. But don't look to anyone else for the solution to your current dilemma. Just pick a destination and focus all of your energy on reaching it. You might be pleasantly surprised when your new strategy of unwavering determination produces the outcome you were seeking all along."
cancer,2015-04-17,"You may experience a breakthrough in awareness today by discovering how to improve your day without jeopardizing the parts of it that are already working. But having a brilliant idea is not significant unless you can follow through with decisive action. You have a lot going for you now as long as you don't attempt to accomplish too much right away. It's better to take many baby steps toward a long-term goal than a few giant steps that lead the wrong way. Ironically, starting slowly and building momentum as you gain confidence saves you time in the long run."
leo,2015-04-17,"Your enthusiasm continues to grow by leaps and bounds; you might feel so confident that you actually believe that you can't do anything wrong. You may not even realize that you sound  overbearing today, leading others to think there are ulterior motives in play. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently offend people unless you soften your approach. Although you don't mean any harm, it's still smart to avoid giving a false impression by acting less aggressively. As long as your intentions are honorable and your behavior is above reproach, you don't need to prove anything to anyone else."
virgo,2015-04-17,"You usually prefer to take things step by step, but your current excitement may trick you into making lots of changes right away. Unfortunately, following through with your plans can be difficult if you move too quickly today. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, you'll accomplish more if you slow down and get it right the first time. Practicing perfectionism is a useful strategy now, especially if you want to be proud enough of your work that you feel ready to move on to your next challenge."
libra,2015-04-17,"A current decision could be a critical turning point on your path, so carefully reconsider your choices before you make a commitment you can't reverse. Even if someone is pushing you to initiate action right away, it's smarter to step back and thoroughly analyze all your options. Don't waste energy trying to justify your lack of productivity today or you might miss your chance to grapple with the bigger picture. Instead of getting caught up in the drama of the moment, keep your eyes on the prize if you truly want to achieve your dreams."
scorpio,2015-04-17,"Career opportunities loom large and your anticipation of the possibilities intensifies day by day. You're excited about the next phase of your life, but it's still too soon to make your next move. Although big changes are now behind you, more are already heading your way; you could have a very different perspective within a few weeks. Resist jumping to any half-baked conclusions today; there's still more you need to learn before making a life-altering choice. Let destiny unfurl at its own pace and dance with the unknown."
sagittarius,2015-04-17,"Obviously, you are happy when so many things seem to be going your way. But the energizing cosmic energy brought to you by passionate Mars squaring joyful Jupiter is not a permanent fix. Although you needn't worry about your plans falling apart today, your current overconfidence can be a trap that makes you overly complacent. You still have to put in the extra effort if you want to keep your life on track. If your goals are really important to you, do everything in your power to reach them for the sake of your own happiness."
capricorn,2015-04-17,"You may be feeling pressure to expand your range of operations now. However, you're not necessarily sure that you can deliver on everything that's expected of you. Thankfully, you have a few well-rehearsed tricks up your sleeves that reinforce your high level of professionalism. Just don't let any lingering insecurities stand in the way of your current work. Fear of failure is not a healthy motivation; instead, focus on the success you wish to achieve. When you show everyone that you mean business, you'll pass even the harshest of tests today with flying colors."
aquarius,2015-04-17,"You might be ruminating about all the people you know who have boldly ventured far from home while pursuing their purpose in life. Meanwhile, you may be challenged by circumstances that prevent you from embarking on your own spiritual journey. However, nothing is gained from indulging in a self-pity party. Don't attempt to rein in control of your thoughts because they are the motivational juice for what you decide to do next. Although your active fantasy life is a bit exhausting now, it will most likely settle down after a night of good rest. The seeds of your quest are sown in your dreams."
pisces,2015-04-17,"A new project at work may be enough to put the bounce back in your step.

But you're not about to share your innermost thoughts now that the independent Aries New Moon fires up your 12th House of Secrecy. However calm you seem to others, you're actually busy plotting and planning with great intention. The Moon's shift into your determined sign later in the day may be your signal to put your ideas into action. There's no time to waste now; you can slow down later only if you get started right away."

You want to live up to everyone's expectations while the Aries New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Responsibility.

Taking some quiet time for contemplation can lead to useful insights that empower your expression and expand your role in the world."
leo,2015-04-18,"You might think your plans are practical, but your excitement overrules a more sensible approach to the day. The enterprising Aries New Moon lands in your 9th House of Big Ideas, tempting you to use your charisma to sell your current cause. It's a mixed blessing that your newly found inspiration effortlessly lures others into your camp.

Be present right now and then let the winds of change carry you where they will."
libra,2015-04-18,"Seeking balance in relationships is one of your primary directives in life. Today's active Aries New Moon draws your attention to your 7th House of Others, making you even more aware of your role as peacemaker. But you could be so intent on helping someone else that you lose track of your own needs. If you're not centered in your energy, you won't be of value to anyone else. Harmony starts within; when you're content with your own dreams, it's easier to be a supportive partner for someone else."
scorpio,2015-04-18,"There's no time like the present moment to make a serious dent in your current list of projects. However, you might mistakenly believe you can do everything all at once now that the self-directed Aries New Moon falls in your 6th House of Work.

Beneath your cheery disposition is your unrelenting drive to make this day as memorable as you can. Although others may be surprised when they realize your true motives, they'll still be glad they joined you on your adventure."
capricorn,2015-04-18,"You need a day off, one without your normal ambitions driving you to take on more responsibility. Instead of trying to produce tangible results now, give yourself the room to sink into your feelings and hang out with those you love. Don't just fill in your calendar with more things to do. Cancel a social appointment and consider staying home tonight. You have been reaching outward and upward long enough. This Aries New Moon falls in your 4th House of Roots; see how it feels when you luxuriate in the tender loving care of your closest friends and family."
aquarius,2015-04-18,"Filling up your day with one exciting activity after another will certainly keep your mind busy, but you might be better off if you took some time to smell the flowers along the way The fiery Aries New Moon ramps up the energy of your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, making everything seem more important than it actually is. You can only distract yourself so long before you grow weary of the commotion. All that glitters is not gold. Slow down and enjoy a bit of silence in between all the extraneous noise."
pisces,2015-04-18,"People might criticize your current priorities because they think you are scattered today. But you have a concrete plan, along with the enthusiasm and determination to execute it on schedule. Don't let anyone else's negativity plant seeds of self-doubt in the fertile soil of your imagination. Honor the Aries New Moon by channeling its creativity into your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Instead of wasting precious time and energy defending your choices, believe in yourself and let your actions tell your story."
aries,2015-04-19,"It's nearly impossible to know what to do today because your friends seem to be sending you mixed messages. Ironically, you are willing to soften your approach in consideration of anyone who sets clear limits, only to have them accuse you of withdrawing when the going gets rough. Unnecessary confusion can get in the way of resolving a misunderstanding if either party makes a hasty assumption. But don't retreat into denial; if there's any doubt about what's been said, check it out. Fortunately, falling back on honest communication enables you to find your way back into the light of truth."
taurus,2015-04-19,"You may remain bewildered about a romantic interest today even if you think you can charm your way through the emotional fog. However, logic is elusive while Venus, the Goddess of Love, squares delusional Neptune. You might even deceive yourself about your altruistic motives since your 2nd House of Core Values is being tested by the cosmic chaos. Happily, this irrational alignment is also capable of triggering your highest ideals. Don't try to cover up your uncertainty; admitting that you're searching for answers is smarter than pretending you already have them. Humility is your friend."
gemini,2015-04-19,"Concentrating on the present moment is a real challenge today because magnetic Venus is battling with dispersive Neptune. Previous goals don't seem as important now that Venus is dancing through your fickle sign. Nevertheless, you're tempted to move forward anyhow without any clear direction.

It may not be the best time to make an important decision, but a wild goose chase could lead you to discover something that comes in handy down the road."
cancer,2015-04-19,"You're so enchanted by your vivid imagination today that it's hard to believe your fantasies aren't real. However, the stark beauty of the mental images is less important than the hidden messages that they convey. Unfortunately, it's not very useful to adopt an overly analytical approach to your interpretations because your logic might limit your creativity. Paradoxically, the only way to capture the magical energy flowing through you now is by letting go of any attempts to control it. Enlightening experiences are awaiting your discovery if you have the courage to take the scenic route."
leo,2015-04-19,"You aren't ready to reveal too much about your feelings today because words can't communicate the subtlety of your emotional landscape. Although you long for the intimacy that comes from sharing your hopes with someone special, it's wiser to wait before you say anything you later regret. It's healthier to err on the side of discretion until you regain your clarity. In the meantime, there's no reason to rein in your fantasies. Dreaming about your ideal future is the best way to bring it into manifestation."
virgo,2015-04-19,"You may sound more wishy-washy than you feel today because loving Venus squares fuzzy Neptune in your 7th House of Relationships. No matter how clear your intentions are now, your words won't be specific enough to please others. Rather than angering someone with your faulty logic or premature conclusions, wait a few days until you have more information and then reevaluate your position. Stop thinking and fully experience the luxury of floating in the realms of your imagination for a while. You have no idea of what treasures you might uncover unless you take the time to look."
libra,2015-04-19,"Planning your next exciting adventure is lots of fun, especially if you don't have to let reality call the shots. Your dreams are larger than life with magnetic Venus visiting your 9th House of Big Ideas; nevertheless, her anxious square to nebulous Neptune blurs your thinking.

Nevertheless, your feelings are quite real, even if your emotions are colored by your camouflaged vulnerability. Trust the higher wisdom of the universe; you don't need to keep to yourself as much as you think. Many people won't understand your actions now, so take the time to explain your thought process as clearly as possible. With just a little extra effort on your part, unspoken words don't have to get in the way of being honest with those you love."
sagittarius,2015-04-19,"Keeping your feelings in check seems like a smart strategy today, but your desire to be seen and heard by someone you admire could win out over your need to play it safe. However, your message may be muddled, since you actually might not know what you want. Although it helps to talk about your current confusion with a trusted companion, complications arise from saying too much. Let your friend know that you're not ready to make lasting decisions now; you're still gathering data and contemplating your options. Be open with your heart only if you're not asked to defend it."
capricorn,2015-04-19,"You could be in for a bit of drama today if your plans fall apart because of lack of proper execution. But even if you have a knack for making your dreams come true, your ideas are not as practical now as you think. Nevertheless, don't quit because you're probably closer to success than you realize. Inching forward slowly is more effective than throwing in the towel. Take another shot at achieving your goals later in the day when you can gain more traction. Practice makes perfect."
aquarius,2015-04-19,"You might be required to respond to an unpleasant surprise that impacts your financial condition today. Although you want to believe that you are always on your toes, you may have overlooked an apparently unimportant detail that creates more worry now than you want.

Sometimes, asking the right person for help opens the door to a much-needed breakthrough while also taking a relationship to the next level."
pisces,2015-04-19,"You may be wearing your heart on your sleeve without even knowing it while vulnerable Venus is squaring off with deceptive Neptune in your sensitive sign. Nevertheless, you could be confused by the reactions of others today because you aren't certain if they understand your true feelings. Actually, your closest friends and family can intuitively sense your emotions before you say anything at all. Don't overcompensate by talking so much that it dilutes your message. The most powerful magic is created now without uttering a word."
aries,2015-04-20,"You're in for a treat today, since you finally get to enjoy the sweet rewards of past efforts. But you might feel as if life is challenging you to stand still and appreciate your current  position, even if you are itching to begin something new. Just as you think you have your restlessness under control, a wave of anticipation catches you off guard, reminding you that you aren't quite ready to settle down. Nevertheless, you don't have to be the first one out of the gate; kick back and indulge in life's pleasures before taking off on your next adventure."
taurus,2015-04-20,"The fact of the matter is it usually takes a lot of provocation for your anger to boil over. Although the Sun's return to your pragmatic sign today encourages you to be calm and peaceful, stress can slowly build until you turn into a raging Bull. Thankfully, you prefer to be a lover than a fighter by focusing on the beautiful aspects of life rather than contributing to any negativity. Setting your intentions on the most positive outcome allows your good nature to shine through all the needless noise."
gemini,2015-04-20,"It's time to take an objective approach by analyzing familiar issues that recycle in your life before they get set aside again without resolution. Of course, it's tempting to bury an unpleasant recollection and the uncomfortable feelings attached to it. However, exploring unknown territory reveals how your emotions are intertwined with rigidly constructed memories. Although self-reflection is useful to generate  personal growth, sooner or later you need to stop worrying about all the things you cannot change. You can't fully embrace the future until you have dealt with your past."
cancer,2015-04-20,"Schedule plenty of time over the next month to reassess and redefine your life path rather than limiting it to the present circumstances. Instead of only focusing on the tedious work you must do today or needlessly obsessing about office politics, look for ways to cultivate your long-term goals. Imagine where you want to be in ten years, but remain practical in the process. Ultimately, it's much more satisfying to watch your dreams slowly take lasting shape than to see them bloom quickly, only to fade from the picture. Good things are worth the wait."
leo,2015-04-20,"Having a job that pays your bills might not be enough to keep you emotionally satisfied now that the Sun brightens your 10th House of Profession. You want a career path that also offers you opportunities for growth and advancement. Unfortunately, your long-term goals may require you to make decisions that interfere with your personal life. However, you can consciously choose to pare back your aspirations so you don't end up over committed. Be proactive and simplify your agenda before you're in trouble down the road."
virgo,2015-04-20,"Your current optimism motivates you to take care of business and clear as many things as possible off your to-do list.

Thankfully, you should be able to positively transform your world if you can discover what causes are at play. Luckily, increasing your awareness may be all that's needed to find satisfaction."
scorpio,2015-04-20,"You want quick answers to the most basic questions before you set yourself up for additional frustration. The radiant Sun camps out in your 7th House of Partnerships over the next month, illuminating a widening gulf between your desire for emotional complexity and someone else's need for low-key simplicity, especially if it impacts a current relationship.

sagittarius,2015-04-20,"You wish you were embarking on a journey of a lifetime, but you cannot afford to ignore your current responsibilities now. The Sun's month-long visit to your 6th House of Work emphasizes the daily routines that give your life consistency. Don't worry about missing out on the fun; you will have plenty of time to play before you know it. The sooner you acknowledge that the immediate emphasis is not on achieving personal satisfaction, you can find happiness by continuing to do the smaller things that truly matter. Count your blessings and get to work."
capricorn,2015-04-20,"Ironically, you could take your current desire for pleasure so seriously that you overbook your calendar and stress yourself out. Luckily, you don't need to try so hard to impress anyone because you're heading into a joyful few weeks while the Sun is shining in your 5th House of Fun and Games. However, it's counterproductive to think and plan so much that it squashes your creative spontaneity.

Grabbing an opportunity while it lasts is wise as long as it doesn't turn your whole world upside down."
aries,2015-04-21,"Life seems complicated if people aren't being clear with you. Although you might not know what to make of someone's inconsistent story, you're able to remain detached from the distractions of an emotional drama.

Thankfully, the process is easier if you initiate a constructive conversation with a positive attitude. You are at your best when your thoughts are in motion.

But your plan will likely backfire if you attempt to suppress another person's expression of fear or anger. The best way to handle this delicate dynamic is to engage others by asking probing questions that demonstrate your genuine concern.

Shining the light of awareness is in the best interest of everyone involved."
leo,2015-04-21,"You're curious about what everyone is up to at work today, yet your playful nature may be quite misleading. Behind your easygoing smile lies an agenda to get others on board with your line of thinking.

Your current emotional intensity may be out of character, surprising others and triggering their insecurities. Still, you're not interested in placating those around you with meaningless banter now.

pisces,2015-04-21,"A coworker or partner who seems to have answers for your questions could motivate you to take action. Fortunately, competent peers can help you be more productive now, but their presence isn't a reason to acquiesce your power. Instead, look at the role you play in your own success, even if you are only one member on a team. Having amazing allies on your side won't rob you of your self-esteem as long as you acknowledge your valuable contribution to the group effort, too."
aries,2015-04-22,"You realize that practicality will pay off as you reassess your current financial condition. You know what's right, but might not make the smartest decisions about your money today because being responsible sounds boring now, prompting you to look for ways to escape your obligations. However, you don't have the luxury to slip away yet. Stabilizing your fiscal situation won't be as painful as you expect if you just narrow your focus and get down to business."
taurus,2015-04-22,"You are driven to make significant progress today as thoughtful Mercury hooks up with impatient Mars. Fortunately, this planetary alignment occurs in your practical sign, empowering you to set priorities and concentrate on your goals. Nevertheless, it's tempting to blame someone else for restricting your creativity, but your fear of failure is likely your real nemesis now. Don't worry if everything seems to take longer than you expect; your willpower enables you to overcome any obstacle that challenges your success."
gemini,2015-04-22,"You tend to see the best possible outcome to nearly any difficult situation now, even if people believe you are being too optimistic in your assessment. The fact is you have your mind wrapped around the entire set of circumstances, no matter how complex the logistics may seem. You know that your thoughts require time to solidify, even if others want your answer right away. There's no need to waste energy explaining your game plan to anyone else. Trust your instincts and stay on your current path until your destination comes into sight."
cancer,2015-04-22,"You grow tired of hearing about everyone else's dramas, especially if you have your own emotional issues you want to share with your friends today. However, you might need to reconsider your tactics if there isn't sufficient time to talk about your concerns now. Nevertheless, it's solely your responsibility to raise topics that are important to you; you can't expect someone to read your mind and do it for you. Friendship is a two-way street; being a compassionate listener hopefully inspires others to do the same."
leo,2015-04-22,"Use your words with care today because they carry a lot of weight now that messenger Mercury aligns with macho Mars. Even if your heart is in the right place, repressed anger could spill over into a conversation without you even knowing it. Instead of speaking only from your point of view, consider other people's feelings before you say anything. Tempering your honesty with a bit of kindness helps everyone involved feel more appreciated in the long run."
virgo,2015-04-22,"Although your visions of the future may need clarification or even revision now, you can take the stress in stride without missing a step. Thankfully, your key planet Mercury is humming in harmony with cosmic bad boys, Mars and Pluto, pushing your creativity close to the edge. There's nothing to be gained by trying to juggle too many projects at once; take a few deep breaths and reassess what still needs to be done. Stay on track and watch the light at the end of the tunnel grow brighter as you gain control over your destiny."
libra,2015-04-22,"Opportunities for growth pop up everywhere you go today. Resourceful Venus creates a supportive sextile with auspicious Jupiter, revealing the silver lining to every black cloud in sight. However, your mental machinations will only take you so far. Surprisingly, it's easy to go the extra distance once you sink into your feelings. There's no reason to be afraid of what you don't understand. Emotions may ultimately hold their secrets, but you can discover magic if you're willing to delve into the mysteries of your heart."
scorpio,2015-04-22,"You may be uncharacteristically quick to share  your thoughts today, especially as loquacious Mercury steps into the unknown to have a conversation with dark Pluto. Nevertheless, divulging too much information can generate a whole new layer of complications. People are less inclined to listen if you're only pushing your personal agenda, so don't talk just to blow your own horn. Engaging in a free-flowing discussion to find places of mutual understanding is a strategy that works well for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2015-04-22,"Although you might not be in the mood to settle down today, there are critical tasks that require your attention. In fact, you may finally be ready to have that heart-to-heart conversation with your boss about your work. Don't play coy; if something needs to be brought out into the open, do it now while communicator Mercury is willing to fight for your cause. Once you make it through the difficult part of the interaction, you may be happily surprised by what happens next. Good news is waiting for you around the corner if you have the confidence to go after it."
capricorn,2015-04-22,"Your mind is like a steel trap today, enabling you to catch relevant facts and hold onto them until they are needed in a conversation. You are driven to use information to your advantage because you have no time to waste in achieving your objectives. Although your sense of urgency could annoy others, they might also be secretly impressed with your impeccable analysis and unwavering ambition. Acknowledging that there is plenty of time to reach your goals alleviates the immediate stress. Thankfully, you will gain more support if you take a few deep breaths and relax."
aquarius,2015-04-22,"Although you love to surprise others by pulling rabbits out of hats, advanced preparation helps you take your success to the next level. But you may be even more productive today if you underplay your hand to avoid inviting unnecessary opposition. Making progress is more difficult once resistance is stirred. Ultimately, your quiet determination is your most useful weapon; gentle persistence brings the most gratifying results."
pisces,2015-04-22,"You know that your professional prospects are going well when you feel good about your accomplishments at the end of the day. Fortunately, your associates will probably resonate to your success story by praising your contribution to a recent project. Additionally, powerful friends in high places may even add more than kind words to the mix now as they help you network in new circles. But don't think for a moment that you're receiving something for nothing. Rest assured that today's rewards are directly connected with yesterday's hard work."
aries,2015-04-23,"Although you try to keep your emotions contained, someone's innocent actions could inadvertently trigger a spontaneous reaction of suppressed anger. Even if you're convinced that everything will turn out well in the long run, you still might forget and lose your temper in an impulsive flash of passion. Blowing off a little steam feels good in the moment, but it won't help you find a lasting solution. Nevertheless, sharing your feelings in a caring manner helps to alleviate the tension and makes the best of an uncomfortable situation."
taurus,2015-04-23,"You long to enjoy the fruits of your recent labor, but you might have to postpone the fun to handle a minor emergency first. Nevertheless, you have a detailed mental picture of how you expect to enjoy yourself, but achieving satisfactory results could be delayed a while longer. Don't struggle to escape your responsibilities or panic about your apparent lack of progress. Focusing too much energy on the outcome could push your dreams further away, instead. Assuming a more laid-back attitude enables you to find pleasure in the present moment."
gemini,2015-04-23,"A friend or partner's criticism plays an important role in your success today. You could be lost in dreams of the finer things in life, only to be confronted by people who aren't playing by your rules. Someone may rain on your parade by showing you where your current plan is lacking. Although you don't want to confront anyone now, burying your discouragement only makes it grow. Avoid the trap of thinking others want to stop you when, in fact, they might actually have your best interests at heart. Keeping an open mind to the feedback you receive cultivates an atmosphere of cooperation and respect."
cancer,2015-04-23,"You're feeling the need to reassess your long-term goals at work but, unfortunately, they might not fit into your current career trajectory. Still, you enjoy discussing the variety of possibilities ahead, even if you're not ready to actively pursue any one specific idea yet. Don't worry about meeting other people's expectations today; just take time to thoroughly explore your options. Regardless of your next move, you might be surprised by what you learn in the process. Exercising a bit of caution makes sense, but waiting too long is counterproductive to your growing momentum."
leo,2015-04-23,"Your psychic powers are running at full tilt while the hypersensitive Cancer Moon camps out in your 12th House of Spirituality. However, you have a gnawing concern that comes and goes throughout the day, telling you that you're not on the right path. Although you don't have to make any major decisions yet, there's no reason to stick to your previous plan if it isn't working. If you're not sure which way to turn, rest assured the passage of time will be enough to change your perspective. Cut your losses and move on to something else only after you have taken the time to weigh out all of the pros and cons."
virgo,2015-04-23,"Making definitive plans for your next adventure isn't as easy as you expected. You may believe that you have all the various puzzle pieces in place only to suddenly discover that your basic assumption is incorrect. Just remember that some ideas are not worth salvaging. It's wise to know when to simply walk away and start over. Nevertheless, everything probably seems more complex now than it will in just a couple of days, so practicing patience is smarter than overreacting. The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry."
libra,2015-04-23,"Your hopes and dreams color your thought process today. You could even realize that your logic isn't very sound, but it's advisable to go through the motions anyhow by visualizing exactly what you want. Keep in mind that the cosmic energy is unstable now and your master plan will likely continue to change over the days ahead. Don't wait for others to decide where you're going or your destiny will be left in their hands. Paradoxically, you may feel as if you're being blown around by the winds of fate, but you're really the master of your own ship."
scorpio,2015-04-23,"Just when you think everything is going well, you could run into a minor setback involving a clash of wills between you and an authority figure. Although a financial disagreement may play into the picture, it's more likely that one person's rigid values are upsetting to the other. You might even think that someone is plotting against you, motivating you to overcompensate by acting in a self-righteous manner. Ultimately, adopting a flexible approach inspires everyone to work together for a higher cause."
sagittarius,2015-04-23,"You might be able to justify your position on a serious matter today, but your decision could have unforeseen consequences down the road. Everything appears more complicated than you prefer, making it all-too-easy to grow befuddled by the conflicting information. It's not that you can't see clearly; it's just that conflicting facts increase the difficulty of choosing one path over another. Take your time; forcing a final answer now creates more problems than it's worth. Dance with the unknown for a little while longer until your clarity returns."
capricorn,2015-04-23,"You see a relationship issue from both sides now, but you're not ready to commit to either point of view. Thankfully, you can navigate your way through this tricky territory by moving toward the center of the potential storm rather than away from it. Staying in touch with your feelings helps you to avoid an unnecessary meltdown as long as you remember that your moods are still in flux. Try not to make any sudden moves; keeping your balance is more important than anything else today."
aquarius,2015-04-23,"You often take pride in your unorthodox point of view, but you might not be able to rationalize your eccentricities today. Furthermore, expressing a rebellious opinion could generate chaos now because you aren't clear when explaining how you reach your conclusions. Don't force your assumptions onto anyone else; there's no logical reason to escalate the current situation into an open conflict. Keep the conversation friendly while biding your time until the energy stabilizes. Be a lover, not a fighter."
pisces,2015-04-23,"Although you can normally spin yarns by following the meandering currents in your imagination, there's no room for daydreaming today. In fact, it's best to keep it real by avoiding speculative thinking now that the Sun is activating stern Saturn in your 10th House of Authority. Even if you find the right words to describe your feelings, your actions may be out of sync with your message. The easiest way to stay out of trouble is to keep your thoughts to yourself until your behavior is more in step with your heart."
aries,2015-04-24,"You are curious enough today about what motivates you that you are driven to explore your own fears. It's as if a previously closed door begins to open today, allowing you access to uncharted depths in the recesses of your subconscious. Tread cautiously because finding your way in to this normally inaccessible space might be easier than dealing with the skeletons you discover there. Nevertheless, you are empowered by the truth and no longer need to fill in the facts with your own subjective worries. Awareness is power."
taurus,2015-04-24,"You are like a lighthouse beacon for your friends today because you can hold your ground, even in the midst of a storm. Your steady nature is a true inspiration to your peers, even if they can't compete with your determination. However, this is not a good time to be complacent, since the currents are shifting and you could quickly lose your sense of direction. If your perspective changes too quickly, bring your focus back to your immediate environment until you have reestablished your bearings. Don't let anyone down; shine your light for all to see."
gemini,2015-04-24,"Interpersonal dynamics seem unstable today, making it tricky to balance your needs with the emotions of others. Nevertheless, a solid opportunity for growth could be in the picture if you're willing to work on understanding your true feelings. Even if you believe you recently avoided a potential meltdown, feelings tend to cycle around now and the past could catch you off guard in the present moment. Rather than creating unnecessary conflict, trusting your intuition leads you to the higher spiritual ground of forgiveness now."
cancer,2015-04-24,"You may be required to work with people who are confrontational today. Fortunately, you can be sympathetic to the feelings of others without actually lowering your defenses. A cautious approach is helpful to revealing your desires now, since your vulnerability could land you in an unpleasant predicament. No matter which way it goes, keep your eyes focused on your goals. Your tenacity saves the day, even if you must separate your personal convictions from your actions for a while. Choosing peace is always a good idea."
leo,2015-04-24,"You are eager to approach your work from a slightly different angle today, prompting you to challenge authority if it prevents you from doing your job well. However, you might run into annoying problems unless you can demonstrate your sincerity right away. No one will be impressed with your cleverness today; instead, others need to know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that you are expressing what's in your heart."
virgo,2015-04-24,"Settling down isn't on your agenda today, even if you're tired of your irrational feelings running you all over the place. Luckily, your astute ability to analyze complex facts puts you ahead of the game. Nevertheless, you feel the stress as you consider the conflicting data that comes from your various experiences. Don't be afraid to retreat emotionally to reestablish your own metaphysical center. Instead of rushing the process now, be patient and create a more workable plan that can actually take you to your destination."
libra,2015-04-24,"Although everyone thinks you're busy working, you may be spending more time than anyone realizes sorting out your feelings. People assume you're pitching in and doing your part to help the cause, but you don't necessarily feel like a team player today. You have more important things on your mind as you integrate the details of your daily routine into your larger vision. It's not your job to get along with everyone now; simply acknowledge what is most important to you and let others form their own opinions. The only person you need to please is yourself."
scorpio,2015-04-24,"It's time to make a concerted effort to pull in your energy and concentrate on exactly what you need. You can accomplish a lot by eliminating extraneous distractions, but you still might not find enough time to make your dreams come true. Avoid hanging on to old judgments about the value of your work. Don't worry about the long-term ramifications of a current decision. Just show up and do the very best you can in each moment. Sticking to your good intentions makes room for a more positive perspective to emerge."
sagittarius,2015-04-24,"Recent confusion may lead to open conflict today. The good news is an animated discussion clears the air of ill feelings and might even result in an unexpected agreement. However, you may harbor resentment if being stuck in a seemingly endless debate prevents you from reaching your goal. Trying to persuade others to accept your solution now only widens the existing gulf. When you acknowledge the differences of opinions instead of pretending they don't exist, antagonism morphs into cooperation and common ground can be found."
capricorn,2015-04-24,"You could be so single-minded about fulfilling your desires today that getting along with others seems relatively unimportant. You may believe everyone is taking an extreme position with no room for compromise. Unfortunately, your current intensity can scare people off or intimidate them to act out of character. In either case, the pleasure of the moment could be lost unless you decide to play well with others."
aquarius,2015-04-24,"One of the ways you maintain your cool composure is by keeping your feelings to yourself. Unfortunately, suppressed passion could boil over today and spill out of its safe container. Don't pretend you are innocent by acting surprised when you express your true desires. A healthier response requires honesty and admitting what you have known for a while. Even if your emotions are quite inconvenient now, it's better for your friends and associates to know what's in your heart. The truth will set you free."
pisces,2015-04-24,"You are more inclined to trust your instincts about love and friendship today, even if they draw you into an unnecessary battle of wills. Others might not agree with you now that your perspective has grown into a more spiritual one. The facts as you know them resonate with your larger-than-life worldview. But it's better to be cautious when revealing your personal beliefs, even if you are confident about your position. Remember, unnecessary conflict can undo the positive steps recently taken. Limit the topics of conversations for your own peace of mind."
aries,2015-04-25,"Your creative juices are flowing today and it's up to you to find the medium for expressing them. However, this isn't just a fun distraction; you have big ideas about what you want to accomplish. Although your desires may tempt you with the possibilities of pleasurable experiences, you'll be happier in the long run if you have tangible results at the end of the day. Being productive is an admirable goal as long as you don't lose your connection with your muse in the process."
taurus,2015-04-25,"There's plenty of action on the home front today, especially if your feelings clash with someone else's. Oftentimes, you see conflict as an annoying source of trouble; you prefer an atmosphere of peace and harmony. Rather than viewing the current family tension as a dynamic you wish to avoid, change your attitude. Engaging in passionate dialogue is an excellent way to explain your own position on an important issue as well as letting others clarify theirs. Your patience and flexibility will lead you to the calm after the storm."
gemini,2015-04-25,"Your regular weekend routines grow more complicated today if other people's unspoken desires cloud the atmosphere. You may talk about simplifying your life, but it's not going to be easy to cut back on your activities in order to accommodate someone else. Instead of fretting over what you can't finish now, just try to meet your obligations as best you can. No matter how much progress you make, you might be surprised with how much you enjoy yourself once you find your groove."
cancer,2015-04-25,"Today is a perfect day to shift gears and put your plan into motion. You have had enough time to process your feelings and consider the various possibilities ahead, so don't  put off the inevitable any longer. Rather than waiting for better conditions to initiate action, take a few steps toward your most important goals now. Although you may be tempted to set priorities based strictly on practical considerations, pursuing an unrealistic dream can open a whole new vista of possibilities. You'll never know what's possible unless you're willing to explore the unknown."
leo,2015-04-25,"You have a smile on your face and a bounce in your step because you can feel your confidence returning today. You might actually notice that the Moon is back in your sign because you are acutely aware of your changing moods. Fortunately, the Moon is moving toward a conjunction with buoyant Jupiter in your 1st House of Personality, adding to your optimism. You may be too impatient to methodically follow a plan now, but locking your sights on a distant goal can help to assure your success. Ironically, keeping your eyes on your desired destination gives you the creative freedom to make it up as you go along."
virgo,2015-04-25,"You might be reticent to participate in social activities today, but circumstances make it increasingly difficult to operate quietly behind the scenes. You need time to concentrate on your priorities, but there aren't many topics you're compelled to talk about now. Explore the magic of your imagination, for that's where you can make the most meaningful connections, especially if you share your discoveries -- when you are ready -- with someone you trust."
libra,2015-04-25,"You are eager to enjoy the benefits of spending time with a special person or a select group of friends today. Thankfully, your good cheer prompts others to hang out with you because they want to soak up your good energy. But the Moon's visit to your 11th House of Social Networking doesn't come without complications, for her square to the Sun could trigger an unexpected power struggle if people have conflicting agendas. Nevertheless, you don't have to focus on the differences. Rather than trying to unify diverging goals, search for the common ground that you already share."
scorpio,2015-04-25,"Your nerves may be on edge today because people seem so fixed that there's little room for your perspective. Although you're willing to be vulnerable and share your needs with a dependable friend, the thought of conflict stresses you out now. You prefer to spend the day on a magical mystery tour, but it's nearly impossible if someone thinks you should be more practical. Thankfully, there's no need to push the panic button. Set your frustrations aside and follow what's in your heart, even if you must let others go their own separate ways."
sagittarius,2015-04-25,"Your close-up vision isn't very accurate today; however, it seems as if you can see forever. You look out toward the distance and you are certain that the horizon -- although it's quite clear -- has moved even farther away. Fortunately, this trick of the light allows you to visualize your future while still juggling your current schedule. Set the notion of immediate gratification aside. Once you remove the immediate pressure, reaching your goals could seem as easy as a walk in the park."
capricorn,2015-04-25,"Your anxiety may be hard to shake today because you know how important it is to stay on task and live up to your promises. To complicate matters further, it's not enough to satisfy your own definition of success; others have their set of expectations, too. However, the temptation of having some good old-fashioned fun looms large and it might be nearly impossible to resist. Fulfill your obligations in the real world while imagining what you would do if you were totally free of responsibility. Luckily, no one can stop you from dreaming."
aquarius,2015-04-25,"Your day could be hijacked by someone who feels the need to share a relationship drama. Whether it's a romantic partner or a new acquaintance, it might appear as if he or she is attempting to limit your personal freedom. However, expressing yourself independently is crucial now because it's your key to rejuvenating your emotional power. Although you're tempted to drop everything to ride to the rescue, keep in mind that you won't have much left to give others unless you take some time for yourself."
pisces,2015-04-25,"Household chores or work-related tasks seem overly tedious today, which could make you feel unusually restless. Your impulsive solution might be to shake everything up in order to turn a dull routine into an intriguing experience. Don't be afraid to express your big ideas, even if they are out of proportion with your current circumstances. Honoring your dreams will ultimately enable you to accomplish more while in pursuit of your higher purpose."
aries,2015-04-26,"You are cruising for excitement but you haven't decided how much to say about your plans for the day. Although you want to steer clear of emotional entanglements, you might not be able to avoid getting hooked by a complicated situation today. Your feelings could change again so don't judge yourself too harshly if you need to backtrack later and make a new strategy. A rational approach helps to keep you free from unnecessary drama, but could prevent you from finding the thrills you seek. Sometimes the pleasure is worth the cost."
taurus,2015-04-26,"You long to swim in calmer emotional waters, but you might have to stir up a few waves of your own first if your values conflict with someone else's. There's a blurry line between demonstrating your integrity and just being overly obstinate. Obviously, don't give up before you make a concerted effort to get your point across. However, relinquishing your need to convince everyone that your position is the only correct one allows you to walk away from the current turmoil. Choosing your battles wisely gives you the opportunity to create your own future."
gemini,2015-04-26,"A recent experience may have created unexpected ripples in your life, shaking up your previous assumptions about what you want from others. You're tired of pretending to be satisfied with the current circumstances and your antidote might involve doing something exciting just for yourself now, regardless of what anyone else thinks. Although you prefer to keep your options open, you could be forced to make a choice today. Even if none of the available alternatives appears perfect, take a risk and express your freedom. No one but you can decide what makes you happy."
cancer,2015-04-26,"You see through the obvious faults in someone's big scheme, which might stop you from investing your time in an unrealistic strategy. However, your unspoken criticism can be perceived by others as negative energy you need to overcome. Although you tend to err on the side of caution, you have a clear sense of how to break free from the trap of routine today and want to create your own plan. The truth of the matter is somewhere in the middle and your wisest tactic is to find a path of compromise that works for all parties involved."
leo,2015-04-26,"It isn't all that easy to zone in on what you offer others, but reevaluating your contribution to a group effort may be a very interesting exercise for you now. Meanwhile, applying your energy to mundane tasks is not a waste of time if you practice self-reflection along the way. Something as trivial as cleaning the house or doing yard work can be inspiring today if you focus on those things that bring you joy. Ultimately, your gratitude is contagious and others will appreciate your ability to make the most of the present moment."
virgo,2015-04-26,"You normally know how to set limits that increase your efficiency. However, you're mildly obsessed with gathering as many facts as you can today. Unfortunately, possessing a whole lot of data isn't as reassuring as simply having certainty. As much as you attempt to let your practicality reign supreme, your current enthusiasm can set you up to inadvertently mislead others. Your reputation is on the line; luckily, you're still capable of using your natural sense of discretion now to save the day."
libra,2015-04-26,"Knowing what to expect from a relationship can make the difference between a brilliant success and a discouraging failure. However, your desire to initiate change must be motivated by optimism because if you're afraid that something won't work out, you could settle on a second-best course of action. Fortunately, you don't have to try so hard now; your partnerships have a better chance of flourishing if you relax into the unknown without trying to control the outcome. Keep your heart open and let nature take its course."
scorpio,2015-04-26,"Having a conversation about some aspect of intimacy and actually being intimate with a loved one are not the same thing. Naturally, it's easier to approach this delicate subject from the perspective of an observer, even if you're confident enough to jump right into the fire now. A sufficient amount of detachment can help you deal with your feelings much more effectively than becoming overwhelmed by them. Nevertheless, you must surrender sooner or later if you want to have the full spectrum of emotional experience."
sagittarius,2015-04-26,"Although you're naturally better at describing a generalized concept than zooming in on the individual facts, the presence of three planets in your 6th House of Details enables you to separate the finer points from the big ideas now. However, it's nearly impossible to gauge how much persistence or resistance might be necessary to get your needs met. You're afraid of asking for what you want and being met with disapproval or even derision. Be as honest as possible today; it's better for everyone to know where they stand than to lead them down a garden path. Transparency is your friend."
capricorn,2015-04-26,"You may be charmed by someone's flirtatious manner and unconventional ideas now. Unfortunately, people's behavior could have you running in circles if you fail to sort through all the incoming information. Your analytical ability is one of your greatest strengths; carefully reassess the entire situation instead of impulsively following your instincts. Once you know that you're making the right choice, announce your intentions and don't look back. As long as your actions are grounded in logic, it pays to listen to the vagaries of your heart."
aquarius,2015-04-26,"You might feel like you're riding a streak of creative lightning today, but it's still a struggle to put your best ideas into concrete action. Unfortunately, you may be tempted to quit prematurely, especially if you aim your sights too high and set yourself up for disillusionment. However, you could miss your chance to demonstrate your talents if you don't establish any goals at all. Quit thinking so much and just flow with your imagination, wherever it leads. Your most extraordinary work now comes from honoring the spirit of the moment."
pisces,2015-04-26,"Your close friends and relatives demand your undivided attention today. Ironically, their encouragement is also just what you need to support your personal growth. Unfortunately, you may have such unrealistic expectations that everyone seems to fall short of their goals now, leaving you disappointed with their efforts. Nevertheless, it's crucial to express your gratitude for what is yours; you cannot afford to waste any energy on negativity. There's no need to pray for miracles; shining your light inspires others to do the same."
aries,2015-04-27,"It's prudent to look before you leap while the dramatic Leo Moon amplifies your tendency to act spontaneously. Your sharp instincts usually steer you well, but an irrepressible desire to express your independence might lead you astray today. If a friend or coworker is critical of your shortsightedness, listen to what is being said instead of immediately going on the defense. Gingerly stepping around any argument now could give you the chance to learn a very useful lesson. Taking someone's advice to heart doesn't mean you need to give up on your dreams."
taurus,2015-04-27,"Your innate ability to hold your ground comes in handy today if someone attempts to pull you in another direction, but your inflexibility might also complicate the circumstances. You can unwittingly create an embarrassing situation by overstating your position and then attempting to defend it at all costs. Take a proactive approach now before minor problems become major issues. Just remember, if everything seems perfect, you're probably not looking hard enough. Knowing the truth can be painful but it's still better than operating in the dark."
gemini,2015-04-27,"Your clever charm can easily distract someone with superficial pleasantries if it's in your best interest. However, the tables are turned today and you may be the one who wants to talk about an unresolved issue that's on your mind. But the conversation won't automatically prove constructive just because you initiate a discussion on a delicate matter. The terrain may be tricky to navigate at first, but stick with it until your message is understood. You will feel a great sense of relief when everything is finally out in the open. Tenacity is your friend."
cancer,2015-04-27,"Although you might believe it's a good day to come out of your shell and take a risk, it won't be as easy as you expect. Your life is further complicated by your heightened sensitivity to other people's feelings today; worrying about their reactions makes it harder to remain true to yourself. Nevertheless, it's more important to maintain healthy boundaries than to monitor every word you say. Don't mix up anyone else's fears with yours. Fly, baby, fly."
leo,2015-04-27,"You may not be able to stop your emotions from spilling over into your work environment while the animated Leo Moon battles with argumentative Mercury. You can be extremely expressive today, especially if you are suppressing any anger. But your coworkers don't want to hear your negativity and their response can upset you even more. However, you could be agitated now because of a hurtful memory; the present moment isn't as intense as it seems. Be gentle with your judgments before you say anything you regret. Finding an appropriate outlet for your feelings is good for everyone involved."
virgo,2015-04-27,"It's not all that easy to trust your logic today, even though that's where you normally find your answers. Your subjective impressions are strong now and you may be provoked to express an irrational opinion so quickly that you don't think about your reply. You might conclude that someone is intimidating you into engaging in a war of words, but your willingness to engage can precipitate a conflict that turns everyone into a loser. Strive for a sensible solution that's built on cooperation rather than competition. Lead with your heart but don't leave your common sense behind."
libra,2015-04-27,"You are determined to clarify your goals and establish priorities that support your hopes for the future. However, your preferences are not in sync with the expectations of others now, and you can't easily share your intentions because you're afraid of letting someone down. Unfortunately, too much self-restraint leads to disappointment in yourself, so find the strength to say what's on your mind. Openly expressing your feelings is therapeutic; your self-esteem improves when your inner and outer worlds are in alignment."
scorpio,2015-04-27,"You're not in the mood to step through a variety of mechanical motions at work just to make someone else happy today. However, if you're able to tap into your creativity, anything is possible. Although you cannot fake enthusiasm, you might get so lost in your fantasies of success now that they seem completely real. Acting as if your dreams have already come true can turn your performance into a stellar one that everyone will remember for a long time to come."
sagittarius,2015-04-27,"Your sudden resurgence of optimism may inspire risky behavior today, especially if you assume that you're running out of time. Although you're able to express your opinions without restraint, it's helpful to be understated in your approach because you might appear pushier than you realize. Don't be so preoccupied with your own agenda that you think everything you do is acceptable. Take a few steps back to give others a little breathing room. You have a better chance of garnering lasting support now if you're not in such a hurry."
capricorn,2015-04-27,"Your passion about a new project motivates you to work harder and smarter, but your intense ambition may seem overwhelming to others. Normally, you can control your excitement and meter it out in a methodical manner to earn the respect of your peers. However, your feelings might get in the way of your calculated success now unless you temper your drive with a bit of common sense. Thankfully, the Moon squares logical Mercury in practical Taurus, enabling you to steady your energy and take the most practical route."
aquarius,2015-04-27,"People's expectations are so high now that you can't possibly deliver on all of the demands being placed on you. Although you could come through with flying colors, you still may be afraid of disappointing your coworkers. Someone in particular might push you too hard and your natural response is to simply push back. Open conflict will only impede your progress and tarnish your reputation; being the best team player you can be turns you into a real hero."
pisces,2015-04-27,"You may inadvertently create a major complication for yourself today if you unilaterally decide that you know what's best for everyone. Even if you're being quite logical about the current work dynamics, you could focus a great deal of significance on a minor detail now instead of considering the whole picture. Changing your strategy isn't easy, but incorporating other people's ideas brings much better results than obstinately sticking to your original plan. An inclusive attitude serves you well."
aries,2015-04-28,"You are motivated by reasonable objectives today but others may be surprised by your unconventional approach. Unfortunately, you might not realize how big a gulf exists between your intentions and how people interpret your actions. Even if you carefully monitor your behavior, you still could be misunderstood. There's no need to overreact; thoroughly discussing your strategy enables you to communicate your perspective with precision. Including your colleagues in your plans allows everyone to share in your success."
taurus,2015-04-28,"You're in your element today and don't want to take time to explain all the details of your game plan. You don't understand why everyone needs so much information when  you just want to get on with your work. Rather than acting annoyed that you must review plans you thought were already good to go, take your cues from the advice you receive instead. You can waste precious energy feeding your anger or you can grab this opportunity to take your good idea and make it even better. Set your ego aside for the sake of success."
gemini,2015-04-28,"It seems as if the big pieces are in place so you're not sure why it's taking so much effort to get your work done today. No matter what, you're determined to overcome any obstacles that arise from your recent decisions. However, you need to pay close attention to your priorities or you might spend time focusing on logistics that are relatively unimportant. Having every little thing perfectly in place would be wonderful, but not if it prevents you from making immediate progress with your plans."
cancer,2015-04-28,"If a coworker or a friend has something urgent to share with you today, slow down long enough to listen. It may seem as if someone is on your case now and even the slightest criticism might elicit feelings of self-doubt on your part. But there is little time to question your skills, so process your resistance as quickly as possible. Instead, step up to the plate and address the underlying issue that is currently standing between you and success. Once you see the problem in a clear light, you can face your own music, change your tune and move on."
leo,2015-04-28,"You could squander your energy by attempting to fight the inevitable today, but the more you struggle against your responsibilities, the harder it is to fulfill them. Instead of fantasizing about the pursuit of more enjoyable activities, just make the best of what's right in front of you in this moment. But don't try to placate anyone with a song and dance. Your no-nonsense attitude combined with sincere effort is the best way to win others over to your side."
virgo,2015-04-28,"Sometimes, you are the most creative when you interpret your ideas in a lighthearted and playful manner. But more often, it's just sweat and toil as you strive to produce something worthy of your efforts. Luckily, you can access the best of both worlds now as your pragmatic approach to a project empowers you to be inspirational in your thinking. You don't have to push your vision along in order to be more efficient today. Express your feelings as authentically as possible and your work will speak for itself."
libra,2015-04-28,"You can take a good idea too far this week because your imaginative approach feels so exhilarating now that you're inclined to run with it as long as you can. But expressing yourself in an artistic manner to grab the spotlight is not a wise application of a passing inspiration. Grandstanding for personal gain won't end up helping your cause. Pay attention to your muse and follow it wherever it goes. Surprisingly, riding your stream of consciousness now will give you the most practical results."
scorpio,2015-04-28,"Your friends and associates place a lot of confidence in you now, which is appreciated but also makes you nervous. They think that you can do nearly anything as you juggle schedule demands and complete difficult tasks as if you were a magician. However, you might be more anxious than others realize, worrying that you can't meet the impossible expectations that seem to be ballooning out of control. Nevertheless, don't underestimate your abilities today. Put your nose to the grindstone and get busy; everyone could be quite pleased with your results when you focus your passion on what matters most."
sagittarius,2015-04-28,"Narrowing your field of vision enables you to make the most of your limited resources today. Thankfully, your willpower is intense now; whatever you believe to be true can actually manifest as long as you remain vigilant in your work. Your first inclination is to agree if someone asks for a favor, but it's healthier to take a few deep breaths before you respond. Consider the ramifications of assuming another obligation prior to fulfilling your previous commitments. Attention follows intention; setting priorities is key to your success."
capricorn,2015-04-28,"Your plans may appear to be progressing smoothly today. But rather than simply going along with the flow and responding to issues only as they surface, take control by stirring up your own waves and surfing to your destination. It isn't in your best interest to wait for something to happen; fine tune your strategy and put it into motion as soon as possible. Naturally, there may be adjustments required later on, but it's still better to initiate action now before the cosmic winds change direction and the opportunity passes."
aquarius,2015-04-28,"Although you're tempted to keep your thoughts to yourself, your impact at work is minimal today if you remain silent. Your rational perspective makes a lot of sense to your coworkers, giving you the power to change people's minds. But there's no need to worry about what anyone thinks; just let them know your plans as they take shape. Your ability to detach yourself from the outcome increases the positive influence you now have on others. Strike while the iron is in your hand and everyone will be suitably impressed."
pisces,2015-04-28,"You're probably receiving more support at work now than you realize even if someone appears to be resisting your efforts. Rather than assuming a defensive posture, take the unsolicited feedback  to heart. Don't exclude potential allies just because they don't agree with all the details of your plan. Your ability to adapt to the will of others could make the difference between success and failure. Be open to modifying your strategy instead of attempting to do it all on your own. Ironically, you can personally benefit the most from finding your strength in numbers."
aries,2015-04-29,"There's a stack of chores in front of you and you have high hopes of getting everything done today. However, events may not unfold according to your plans due to circumstances that are beyond your control. Don't waste time trying to figure out what went wrong because you might not be able to understand it, even if you have all the facts. Nevertheless, your imagination reigns supreme now. Exploring fantasy realms inspires you to loosen the reins and try a new approach to the work at hand. Trusting your instincts leads to greater productivity."
taurus,2015-04-29,"You believe that you are being your most charming self today, but something you say might be misconstrued, creating problems where there previously wasn't one. You are patient enough to meticulously explain your intentions, but somehow your words can still miss the mark. Your smartest strategy now is to stop trying so hard to convince others to listen. Paradoxically, as you relax your need to prove anything, others will finally get your point."
gemini,2015-04-29,"Discovering a hidden truth can be a real shocker but at least you have a stable emotional framework to soften this unexpected reality check. If interactions with friends are stressed because of a recent disagreement, the dialogue should flow more easily now if you don't get hung up on unimportant details. But you could also gloss over a significant piece of data that spins a conversation into strange territory. It's not necessary to force the topic back onto familiar ground today; just be aware of where you stand and how far you're willing to go."
cancer,2015-04-29,"You're expected to take the lead on the job today, but someone may hesitate to follow your directions. This lack of support is only one facet of a delicate situation -- especially since the negativity that appears to come from others could actually be yours. Reexamine your plans and be open to the possibility that you are facing your own suppressed fear in a projected form. If this is the case, you're the only one who can change your mind. Believing in yourself is the first step to success."
leo,2015-04-29,"You may be operating on autopilot today. It's not that you aren't aware of your actions; it's just that you are spontaneously making choices while you are still in motion. However, you might need to modify your behavior now because you want to be more conscious of why you are deciding one thing and not another. Logical analysis can be constructive as long as you don't turn it into an obsession that disconnects you from your intuition. Your self-awareness enhances your professional success."
virgo,2015-04-29,"It's nearly impossible to understand people's behavior today because their words don't seem to match their actions. Confusing relationship dynamics might throw you off course as you try to make all the pieces fit together into a comprehensible picture. Surreal experiences and an overactive imagination can lead you to feeling alienated from others, even if your conversations seem to flow smoothly. Simply acknowledge the gulf between your fantasies and reality; thankfully, just talking about the differences may be enough to bridge the gap."
libra,2015-04-29,"You don't like it when someone prods you into doing something that you are not ready to do just yet. Luckily, your current indecision is already starting to wane and a friend or an acquaintance acts as a catalyst by sharing a perspective you hadn't previously considered. The good news is your intuition may be more on target than you realize when it comes to manifesting your dreams. Make your move while the cosmic forces are working on your behalf."
scorpio,2015-04-29,"You have the potential to feel passionate about a new project if you are open to the guidance of your imagination and signs from other spiritual dimensions. But you might float through the day in confusion if metaphysical communication isn't your cup of tea. Your traditional planetary ruler, Mars, is downloading cosmic instructions sent from mystical Neptune today, requiring you to stay receptive to the messages contained in symbols rather than words alone. Fortunately, you can still learn valuable lessons even if you don't understand the meaning of it all just yet."
sagittarius,2015-04-29,"It may not be easy to maintain your optimism now, but a touch of self-doubt need not be a source of worry. Every once in a while, it's healthy to consider realistic scenarios and integrate them into your plans to increase your chances for success. It's absolutely crucial to think critically today, even while dreaming of all the amazing possibilities just around the corner. However, there's no need to shut off your imagination in order to reach your goals."
capricorn,2015-04-29,"You're relieved that everything seems to fall into place today as you take care of your domestic chores. But, you might also feel as if you're just going through the motions and that your mind is wandering elsewhere. Although your inability to concentrate could be somewhat disconcerting, there's no harm in living in two worlds now. Keep one foot here on Earth while the other one steps off into Fantasyland for a little excursion. A wondrous adventure is waiting for you in your imagination if you're willing to go there."
aquarius,2015-04-29,"It's as if you've been given a free pass to visit imaginary worlds that you get to create on your own. Whatever indulgence you choose now, sensory stimulation becomes a catalyst for generating vivid fantasies. However, you also have very real obligations to handle today, and you can't avoid them by burying your head in the clouds. Balancing your desires and your responsibilities is never easy, but if you simply take your time and do it right you can enjoy the escapist behavior of your choice with a clear conscience."
pisces,2015-04-29,"You may as well be co-starring in a fantasy movie while your key planet Neptune sends out several scripts from a parallel universe today. You are eager to impress everyone with how well you play your role, but you're perplexed because you aren't sure which part is yours. Your real lesson now is about trust. Asking a reliable friend for direction is a good start, but you must put your faith in their advice to earn your place in the spotlight."
aries,2015-04-30,"You are distracted by one unexpected event after another today, but you handle the apparent chaos well. Although you are comfortable hanging out on the edge of the unknown, you should tread carefully now; you're not as invincible as you might think. Ironically, even if your adrenaline is pumping, you still have a positive effect on others because the current uncertainty is more exciting than being stuck in a rut. Nevertheless, it's wise to calm your nerves with meditation, yoga or physical exercise. You can do even more good if you channel your excess energy into healthy pursuits."
taurus,2015-04-30,"You might feel ready to give up today, tired from doggedly chasing material goals. You have more on your plate than anyone realizes yet you're still being asked to spread your energy even thinner. Instead of agreeing to someone else's agenda, set priorities and focus on the most important tasks first. Panic is unnecessary even if you run into unanticipated problems. It's all about your frame of mind. Looking at the current pressures from a more spiritual perspective offers you the breathing room you need."
gemini,2015-04-30,"It's all too easy to wear your heart on your sleeve with sweet Venus bringing her special charms to your 1st House of Personality these days. But there's an awkward tension in the air and you can lose your patience if you don't take time to honor your feelings. You may even find yourself swept up in the heat of an argument now, wondering how things went so wrong. Remember, you're not the only person who is stressed out today, so steer clear of unnecessary conflict by demonstrating how well you listen when relationships are at stake. Responding with kindness cultivates an atmosphere of love and respect."
cancer,2015-04-30,"People may assume that you're satisfied with your personal relationships, but they don't have a clue because you're keeping your true feelings under wraps. Your heart is drawing you out into deeper waters today where the emotional currents can carry you off course. However, you could reach a breaking point if it requires too much energy to hide your inner world from those you love. Don't procrastinate; say what's on your mind before it's too late. Nevertheless, demanding results will just stir up unnecessary resistance. Keep your expectations to a minimum now and give others time to respond in their own fashion."
leo,2015-04-30,"You don't understand why people seem to expect more from you now, but you're not happy with the extra pressure and you could spend much of the day attempting to alleviate the tension. Unfortunately, even the cleverest of tactics won't hide the edge in your voice. Examine your underlying emotions if you notice that your words sound sarcastic or mean. There are several sensible strategies for reestablishing harmony, yet saying hurtful things is not one of them. Instead, cultivate the peace you seek by treating others with respect and kindness."
virgo,2015-04-30,"Concentrating on your job is more complicated now than anyone realizes. Sometimes it's relaxing to let your thoughts meander for a while, but today your fantasies may activate memories that are not all that pleasurable. Worrying about meeting someone's expectations leads you around in endless circles. Fortunately, you can halt a temporary emotional tailspin by doing something useful in the present moment, rather than wasting time stressing about the past. Focusing on what you can control instead of what you can't is essential for your progress."
libra,2015-04-30,"Behaving in a practical manner can be tricky business while romantic Venus aligns in an otherworldly configuration with jovial Jupiter and surreal Neptune. Nevertheless, a lighthearted attitude seems inappropriate if you think you should be more concerned with serious issues. You may be too conscientious to even entertain the notion of escaping from your responsibilities today. Although satisfaction seems elusive now, the Moon's return to your sign helps you understand your feelings in relation to the outer world. Figuring out what your heart wants is the first step to happiness."
scorpio,2015-04-30,"You're not happy about having to maintain such a high level of productivity today, especially with so many intriguing distractions knocking on your door. However, your strength of purpose is non-negotiable when it comes to your work. You really don't want to get angry at anyone, but enforcing your limits could be an effective way  to quickly let others know that you mean business. Those unwilling to help you along your path would be wise to quietly step out of your way. Establishing clear boundaries now sets you up for future success."
sagittarius,2015-04-30,"You are especially intrigued by the mysteries of life and love today. However, you may be frustrated by your unsuccessful attempts to put your feelings into words. You're tempted to sidestep the entire issue by telling a humorous story so you don't have to expose your vulnerability. However, skimming the surface won't reveal the hidden meaning of life or deepen a relationship. Although it's easy to demonstrate your clever wit, it's more important now to be completely honest and share what's in your heart."
capricorn,2015-04-30,"Although you're listening to the beat of a distant drummer today, you won't likely be caught off guard by an unexpected event. In fact, you appear to be more emotionally stable than ever, drawing people to you as they try to manage the stressful situations in their lives. However, you have your own worries now, and everyone else's demands just add extra layers of anxiety. Nevertheless, go ahead and offer your shoulder to a loved one; what might feel like a sacrifice at first could end up being the most meaningful thing you do all day."
aquarius,2015-04-30,"Remembering simpler days from the past makes you feel nostalgic today as you secretly wish for their return. You long for the innocence and simplicity lost, and can't help but feel frustrated with how complicated your life has grown. Thankfully, you still have an opportunity to live out your dreams, even if you're balancing on an emotional high wire now. This chance won't come again, so don't let your fears or doubts stop you from embracing your future."
pisces,2015-04-30,"You have more emotional strength held in reserve than people realize, yet your uncertainty about your own power can get in the way of your success. Don't succumb to any feelings of insecurity by needlessly comparing yourself to anyone else. You are a unique individual with unique capabilities; the key now is your own self-awareness. Listen to your inner voice of intuition; having faith in the wisdom of the universe empowers you to be true to yourself."
aries,2015-05-01,"Your productivity can reach new heights now, even if you fritter some of the day away. However, just drifting along isn't in your best interest; you must make a concerted effort to use the cosmic energy that's available to you today. The real key to your success is to focus on one activity at a time. It's quite simple: if you maintain your concentration, even for short bursts of focused intensity, you will get so much work done in such a short amount of time that others will think you're a wizard. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
taurus,2015-05-01,"You might feel a bit off balance today as work-related pressures tax your ability to make informed decisions. Being flexible is not necessarily one of your greatest strengths, yet staying loose can make all the difference in the world now. If you are uptight, you could find yourself struggling with things that are unimportant in the long run. Instead, go with the flow; listen, feel and respond to reduce friction and make a little room for fun. Spontaneity is your friend."
gemini,2015-05-01,"You want to impress people with how fast you can think on your feet, but they prefer you to have all your facts in order today. Although loquacious Mercury feels at home in your sign, you cannot fast-talk your way around the truth. You're an excellent conversationalist who can switch topics so rapidly that others can't follow. Face the music; you're not going to dazzle anyone with your fancy footwork now, so you might as well stop tap-dancing and settle down to business."
cancer,2015-05-01,"Letting go of an old belief allows you to be more experimental with your life today. Nearly every interaction holds the potential to explore new possibilities. You can approach a problem with a unique solution that might not work out, but, fortunately, you don't have to get it right the first time. Giving yourself permission to make mistakes enables you to consider many alternatives before following through on the one that makes the most sense. You may have to look outside of the box to find your key to success."
leo,2015-05-01,"Listening with an open mind to everyone today enables you to play the role of the gracious diplomat. Demonstrating an honest curiosity about the lives of those around you motivates you to help others to find workable resolutions to their differences. Your interest in widening your perspective allows you to tune in and hear what people have to say, thereby giving you a solid foundation for a healthy and productive dialogue. Your willingness to engage acts as an inspiration to the rest of the world."
virgo,2015-05-01,"You're hearing conflicting stories at work today and you don't know who to believe or which way to turn. A simple decision could become complicated because you cannot uncover all the facts. Nevertheless, it's crucial to find your answers before the current circumstances change dramatically. Don't wait for a better time; keep asking questions until you get to the bottom of the issue. But this quest for the truth is not just about alleviating the tension; you can also deepen your understanding of the complex dynamics at play if you're willing to dig deep enough."
libra,2015-05-01,"People may be tugging at you from different directions with their unrealistic expectations. Being adaptable enough to meet the needs of others is admirable as long as you don't lose yourself in the process. Unfortunately, you might feel hypersensitive with the receptive Moon still lingering in your sign today. One way to overcome your emotional vulnerability is to establish your agenda before you even leave the house. Heading into the day with a clear vision of your goals could be enough to keep you on track no matter what happens."
scorpio,2015-05-01,"Your emotions are highly volatile today, even if you keep them wrapped up tightly, safe from prying eyes. Instead of assuming you know how others are feeling, assume the role of an observer while waiting for the right moment to share your insights. You can become the real power broker behind the scenes by avoiding the bright spotlight now. Take pride in your work, even if only a handful of people notice at first. Don't force anyone to play his or her hand; be patient and your chance to shift the energy will arrive soon enough."
sagittarius,2015-05-01,"Your presence can be a shining light in someone's life today as you lift the spirits of a sad friend or encourage a disenfranchised colleague. However, there's no need to worry about coming up with the specifics of an alternative plan for anyone, since details aren't your forte. Your current goal is to paint a rosy picture of what's possible in the future, rather than dealing with the practical matters of the day. Being a visionary is a job that suits you well, especially when you can illuminate the way for others to follow."
capricorn,2015-05-01,"You might feel as if you are walking along a tightrope today as you try to maintain your emotional balance. Expansive Jupiter inspires you on one side while erratic Uranus destabilizes you on the other. You're tempted to ignore your responsibilities and cut loose, but it's probably not a wise choice for now. Instead, let your innate maturity guide you through the day while keeping your eyes open for a possible escape route in case you need one."
aquarius,2015-05-01,"You're often motivated by higher truths rather than immediate practicalities. However, these conceptual ideas can be quite a distraction today, preventing you from focusing on important issues on the home front. Although exploring your philosophical approach provides much inspiration, it's not healthy if it distracts you from taking care of urgent family business. Jump into the fray with an open heart. But don't try to control every thought, for your unbridled imagination is the best tool you have to fix the current problem on your plate."
pisces,2015-05-01,"You have a fairly even-handed approach to a complicated relationship issue today. The Libra Moon falls in your 8th House of Intimacy, requiring you to traverse some pretty tricky emotional territory. You might not have the words to easily describe the mixed signals that are flowing between you and a loved one now, so finding common ground can be elusive. Nevertheless, allowing for give and take in conversation may be just enough to guarantee that both parties are heard. Honest dialogue is the most reliable path to resolution."
aries,2015-05-02,"Although you Rams are sometimes criticized for behaving selfishly, the emphasis is on everyone else today. You might even feel a sense of relief now that you can take a break from focusing on your own personal agenda. Instead of trying to get your way, concentrate on what you could do for others to make them feel at ease. Fortunately, your current graciousness allows everyone to reflect your positive vibes back to you."
taurus,2015-05-02,"Serving others now can take you down a very sweet path to happiness today as the lovely Libra Moon brings you an abundance of pleasurable experiences. However, you might not feel so great if you choose to only satisfy your own needs. It's not worth the effort to try changing external circumstances to match up with your personal preferences. Instead, let go of your expectations and offer your assistance wherever you think it might help most. Being someone's angel is its own reward."
gemini,2015-05-02,"Although complications that are outside the sphere of your control loom close, friends and family are especially supportive now, bringing you joy in the moment. You deserve the respite you may be offered from a rather tumultuous few weeks and the heavier issues clouding the horizon won't get in your way if you let them slide for a while. Thankfully, taking some personal time enables you to return to your responsibilities emotionally recharged and physically well-rested. A change of pace does you a world of good."
cancer,2015-05-02,"You might not be able to spend the entire day hanging out with your family and friends, but being around those you love revitalizes your spirit while the Moon is camping out in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. You are eager to show everyone that you have what it takes to be a consummate host now, so round up a few friends and fire up the barbecue. However, entertaining others is only part of the equation; don't forget to bask in the love of those closest to you while you have the chance."
leo,2015-05-02,"You don't have to say yes to every single invitation with your name on it, because you could end up so scattered that your current spark of excitement is extinguished. You may have many tasks to complete, especially if you are in charge of a family or group activity. Rather than running in circles attempting to take care of everything for everyone, try delegating some of the chores to others. Relinquishing control isn't easy, but it's the wisest thing to do now for the benefit of the group."
virgo,2015-05-02,"You're able to keep your feet on the ground today while also flitting around like a social butterfly. You have a particular point of view, but don't want to waste energy defending it. Even if you successfully hide your current beliefs from public scrutiny, you still can't escape from the pressing concerns that are weighing on you. Spending a little time on more serious matters may be prudent, but even you conscientious Virgos need to get away from your regular responsibilities. Work smarter, not harder."
libra,2015-05-02,"Maintaining an objective approach to life isn't straightforward today as the emotional Moon in your sign activates susceptible Venus. Your insecurities, opinions and biases may leak out, even if you think you are cleverly keeping them out of sight. Don't fight to hide your natural likes and dislikes; if you bury your feelings, you could end up angry or resentful. Instead of pretending that everything is all right just to please everyone, show up and be your authentic yourself."
scorpio,2015-05-02,"You are in touch with emotional dynamics that are just lurking in the shadows but you don't want to create additional problems in a relationship now, making it difficult to share your concerns. Nevertheless, you also have some significant information you need to express. Don't tie your disclosure to anyone else's actions; just put your feelings out there with no expectations. Ultimately, whatever you say can be less disruptive if you say it with kindness."
sagittarius,2015-05-02,"Kicking back with a few of your best friends might be just what you need today. In fact, the timing could be right for a celebration, since it's wise to surround yourself with like-minded people while the Moon is currently visiting your 11th House of Networking. Be grateful that you are a part of a growing community. Your sense of belonging to something greater than yourself grounds you in ways that may not be apparent on the surface. When you're more comfortable with your place in the world, you become a more productive member of society."
capricorn,2015-05-02,"You demand respect from all those you encounter while the Moon is energizing your 10th House of Status. Fortunately, doing the right thing elevates your standing in your community. Although you enjoy the company of others, you may be too busy with your own personal agenda to have much to do with anyone who isn't in your closest circle of friends. Instead of pursuing every social connection now, limit your interactions to those who can move you closer to your dreams."
aquarius,2015-05-02,"You may feel as if you're up for nearly anything that sounds like fun, especially if your friends are participating in the activity. In fact, what you do is currently less important than who you do it with. Although you can get away with following your heart now, you still must honor your previous promises. Nevertheless, there's nothing wrong with trying to postpone a deadline until tomorrow if it means you can do something special today. Ultimately, you need both work and play to be a happy camper."
pisces,2015-05-02,"You prefer to approach all interactions in a rational manner today. Unfortunately, if someone makes an unreasonable demand, you still might try to fulfill their wishes. Balancing your needs with those of others can be challenging, but don't be afraid to establish healthy boundaries now or someone may push you too far. Remember, catering to the desires of others doesn't mean you must give up on finding satisfaction. Be a good friend to yourself."
aries,2015-05-03,Sticking close to the facts is crucial today because deviations from the truth elicit an unavoidable reality check. You can run into trouble if you don't think about the impact of your words before you speak. But you won't get away with shallow communication while the Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Creating intimacy in a relationship requires you to have the courage to delve into your emotions. Open your heart and meet the other person halfway.
taurus,2015-05-03,"You have big ideas about how much you can accomplish today, only to realize you underestimated the time needed to achieve your goals. If you promise more than you can deliver, someone might confront you with his or her disappointment over your lack of productivity. It's all too tempting to just ignore the criticism with the Scorpio Full Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others. Nevertheless, actively listening without becoming overly defensive increases your chances for happiness in the long run."
gemini,2015-05-03,"You might not be willing to accept opinions that you consider to be unnecessarily critical when the Scorpio Full Moon lights up your 6th House of Details. However, your sharp tongue can be quite cutting today if someone gets on your case. But your sarcasm could be a byproduct of your unexpressed hurt feelings. Instead of masking the truth with humor, take a risk and acknowledge your vulnerability. Being human isn't always easy, but it's the only option available at this time."
cancer,2015-05-03,"Conjuring up nostalgic memories of the past when relationships seemed less complicated won't help your current situation today. The emotionally intense Scorpio Full Moon floods your 5th House of Romance, bending your social life out of shape. However, this warping of reality is simply a sign that change cannot be avoided any longer. Don't retreat from a conflict of values that needs to be addressed now. Facing a tough issue that stands between you and someone you love can ultimately simplify the dynamics and bring harmony back into your relationship."
leo,2015-05-03,"Your unspoken feelings are stretched like a rubber band today and the tension could make you quite uncomfortable. Unfortunately, there aren't any quick fixes to the complex circumstances that are tangling up your personal life. Rest assured that the situation is about to improve now that the Scorpio Full Moon casts her light in your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. However, it's up to you to facilitate the necessary change by making enough time with family members to talk about those things that truly matter."
virgo,2015-05-03,"You are anticipating a shift in the emotional dynamics in your immediate environment, but you don't know how it will play out. But even if you decide to maintain the status quo in your daily routine, you still feel the pressure to change now. The provocative Scorpio Full Moon highlights your 3rd House of Communication today, inspiring you to reveal feelings that aren't easy to bring out into the open. However, sharing your heart's desires is the first step toward manifesting the improvements you so desperately seek."
libra,2015-05-03,"Just because you have a tough time making up your mind sometimes, your indecision isn't necessarily a sign of weakness. In fact, you often go out of your way to be objective when choosing one path or another. However, you must announce your choice while the various alternatives are still available now. The Scorpio Full Moon enlightens your 2nd House of Core Beliefs, empowering you to hold on to a position even if you are uncertain about it. Be strong; don't compromise your values for the sake of temporary convenience. Follow your instincts and don't look back."
scorpio,2015-05-03,"You could inadvertently undermine your position or lessen your effectiveness by expressing your feelings now. A more strategic move is to carefully monitor your inner process rather than running with your gut reaction. Today's evocative Full Moon is in your sign, sensitizing you to the subtle energies in the atmosphere. However, waiting for the right moment to share what's in your heart enables you to gain power rather than lose it to a fleeting moment of passion."
sagittarius,2015-05-03,"Something important is ready to go down in a relationship today, but you might not be able to wrap your mind around it yet. The seductive Scorpio Full Moon reflects the energy of your 12th House of Destiny while powerful unconscious forces pull you in directions that aren't yet apparent. But overreacting now won't lead to satisfaction. If plans for the future seem to be growing out of control, just roll with the waves for a few more days. Ultimately, being honest with those you love is your best path to creating positive change."
capricorn,2015-05-03,"Your intentions may be up in the air today with the mysterious Scorpio Full Moon activating your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. However, it's not as if you're lost in the dark; you have likely struggled plenty to figure things out. Although you clearly understand the dynamics at play, you just don't know how to put the pieces together to make it all work. Relinquishing control doesn't mean that you have failed. In fact, releasing the reins at the right time is a true act of courage and grace. Close your eyes and let the Force be with you."
aquarius,2015-05-03,"People seem to think you can do nearly anything today, leaving you a bit worried about meeting their expectations. It isn't that you lack determination; it's just that you may feel as if you're in over your head and the pressure to get it right is overwhelming now. Nevertheless, the resolute Scorpio Full Moon occupies your 10th House of Public Responsibility, so you're not willing to just walk away from it all. Don't allow your fears to work against you. Breathe deeply and give it your best shot; your true friends won't ask for anything more."
pisces,2015-05-03,"Your active imagination enables you to see things in a different light. But this paradoxical approach to reality may be a burden today because it's no simple task to explain your intuitive process to anyone else. Nevertheless, the perceptive Scorpio Full Moon stimulates your 9th House of Future Vision, empowering you to influence the unfolding changes by visualizing them before they occur. Trust your inner guidance; your feelings are probably more in tune with the big picture than you think."
aries,2015-05-04,"You must make a decision today as your desire to demonstrate your love conflicts with more practical pursuits. It's as if your gesture of affection could cause negative ripples in other parts of your life. Nevertheless, you might choose to proceed as if you didn't care what happens next. Be careful; there's no reason to push an unstable situation past the point of no return. Your plans will only fall apart if you go overboard in your drive to experience pleasure in the moment. Observe the edge without going over it."
taurus,2015-05-04,"Everything seems more complicated than necessary today. People may tell you more than you deem appropriate and knowing too much isn't a comfortable position for you. You might want to retreat in your mind to a simpler time, but going back to the past won't prevent the future from arriving. The wheels are in spin and you can't stop them even if it all feels like too much. You have the best chance to positively influence the future when you fearlessly act with good intentions. Instead of closing down your heart to protect it, keep returning to a place of love."
gemini,2015-05-04,You may be so busy today that you don't have time to get anything done. Part of the problem is your frantic need for personal interaction. You might spend more time at the water cooler sharing your weekend adventures or on coffee break exchanging gossip with your coworkers. Consider why you're avoiding your work before you land in trouble with your boss. There are smarter routes to expressing your independence than baiting authority by goofing off. Maintain your reputation by setting clear priorities and sticking with them. Less talk and more action is the key to your success.
cancer,2015-05-04,"You might employ complex tactics to keep your emotions off everyone else's radar screens. Unfortunately, the logic that drives this evasive strategy may be faulty to begin with. If you try to steer clear of expressing the wanderings of your heart, you could get drawn into an argument about your core values, anyway. If your insecurities start to show, your passions will rise and you'll likely slip and say more than you intended. Believe it or not, it's less stressful if you just speak your truth right from the start."
leo,2015-05-04,"Being the identified optimist in your group can be a blessing because people like to bask in your enthusiasm. However, too much of a good thing may backfire today. Blind faith won't get you to your destination any faster; it will only have you running off the road with your eyes closed. The power of positive thinking works for you as long as you apply small doses of self-restraint along the way."
virgo,2015-05-04,"You might believe that angels will swoop down to rescue you today -- and maybe they will. But, unfortunately, maybe they won't -- and this isn't a risk that's worth taking now. Even if you have helpers in other dimensions working on your behalf, it's still smart to go through all the motions as if you were on your own. Positive intentions and rigorous follow-through will likely be rewarded. As the Arab proverb says, ""Tie up your camel first and then put your trust in God."""
libra,2015-05-04,"Your vision of the future is wide open today; you feel as if the sky is the limit. However, you may push your luck too far and the price you might have to pay for your bad judgment isn't worth the possible rewards. People may mean well when they encourage you to act on your dreams but be wary of anyone who says you can do anything you want now. Even if you're more capable than you admit to yourself, acknowledging both your strengths and your weaknesses makes the difference between failure and success."
scorpio,2015-05-04,"Your passion for your work overcomes any reservations you may have about turning down a new project. However, just because you can talk yourself into saying yes, this doesn't make it a good idea. Don't be a fool and rush in so fast that you lose sight of the common sense that should be guiding your decisions at work. A tried and true tactic is to make a list of all the pros and cons of the venture. Making an informed choice is only possible after you objectively assess the opportunity from all angles."
sagittarius,2015-05-04,"Expressing your creativity today might require you to step so far out of the box that you can't even remember what containment felt like. Exploring your imagination is enticing, but it's not without its complications. Admittedly, traveling out of the realms of certainty and into the world of unrealized inspiration is a gamble. There are no definite cause-and-effect guarantees in the Land of Vision. Nevertheless, your current attraction to the potential of the unleashed mind may be irrepressible now. No one can take this journey but you."
capricorn,2015-05-04,"Your friends can't see the weight of responsibility you are carrying on your shoulders now. They might expect you to be more happy-go-lucky than you actually feel. However, you have neither the time nor the energy to stop and explain yourself to every person you meet along your way today. Don't let anyone talk you out of your current plan of action. You mean business, but your optimism is strongly at work beneath the surface, motivating you to do great things. When you reach for the stars, you have the power to change the world."
aquarius,2015-05-04,"Breaking out of a rut has consequences today, but you're willing to wager on your future. Taking a calculated risk is admirable, assuming you have actually done the logical analysis first. However, you could miss your opportunity to make a knowledgeable decision if you don't even stop to think about the ramifications of what you say or do. Limits are not meant to hold you back now; instead, they can clarify what is important and what is not. Free your mind and the rest will follow."
pisces,2015-05-04,"You are hopeful that your compassionate nature will get you through a difficult obstacle course today. Fortunately, your inspirational objectives are a tremendous help, but they are not enough to save the day by themselves. You can see the top of the mountain, but must have a concrete plan to reach the summit or you will fall short of your mark. However, once all the pieces are in place, you still need to come through with the goods. Realizing your goals requires a methodical execution; there is no rest for the ambitious."
aries,2015-05-05,"People can't help but take notice of you when you walk into a room today. It's as if they are watching your every move to see what you will do next. Don't squander this chance to bring others into your camp. Remember, your persuasive powers are the strongest if you remain true to yourself -- so consider what you value most. Your integrity is non-negotiable; once you are clear about your priorities you can let circumstances influence your progress, but not your direction."
taurus,2015-05-05,"No one seems to understand you today because you're at a loss to find the right words to describe your emotions. Since it's challenging to put your feelings into language now, just work with whatever thoughts come to mind. There's no reason to push the process, but initiating a dialogue still makes the most sense if you want to create deeper connections with others. Keep your heart open; quiet perseverance is your secret weapon for relationship success."
gemini,2015-05-05,"Your actions are closely aligned with your heart now, creating quite a force to be reckoned with. People might be too quick to write you off as a lightweight, but your closest friends and relatives are more inclined to listen to your ideas today because your behavior conveys the fire of your convictions. Nevertheless, choose your words carefully, but don't expect immediate results because it may still take a while for your message to sink in. Fortunately, you're wired into a vein of inspiration and the truth will prevail."
cancer,2015-05-05,"You are tapping into a deep well of emotions now and are more than willing to tackle the most significant issues of the day. Fortunately, you're in a fantastic position to learn something new about your relationship with power, assuming that you are motivated to process your feelings rather than just observing them. Don't try to explain your motives to everyone who inquires about your objectives; just ask them to respect your current choices and your need for space. Sometimes you must spend a little time in self-reflection before you can be emotionally present for others."
leo,2015-05-05,"You may spend a lot of needless time and effort managing your extreme feelings today, but emotional moderation is likely an elusive goal when others interfere with your process. You can become so worked up over the situation that you believe the issues at stake are more critical than they actually are now. As stressful as the current conflict sounds, you simply must take a leap of faith and let go of control. Fortunately, you could be pleasantly surprised at everyone's willingness to jump in and do their part to support you on your journey."
virgo,2015-05-05,"Your powers of concentration turn you into a superhero today, leaving little to stand in your way of success. Trust your intuition because you can see the future spread out in front of you now, even if you can't yet put your vision into words. In the meantime, create a detailed strategy, but give yourself a few days before you share your current scheme with anyone else. There's no reason to show your hand until you're ready to play it. Putting your cards in order is necessary to turn the game to your advantage."
libra,2015-05-05,"Your creativity is flowing from the unseen depths of your mind today, enabling you to express what's in the dark recesses of your imagination. Nevertheless, it may be too soon to know exactly where your inspiration is leading. But don't worry if you can't get far enough ahead to gain some perspective or you might exhaust yourself for no reason at all. Follow your muse without asking too many questions. To quote Oscar Wilde, ""Life imitates art far more than art imitates life."""
scorpio,2015-05-05,"A secret doorway to hidden treasures within your subconscious is unlocked today by the radiant Sun's superconductive trine with penetrating Pluto. These gems are most often totally unreachable, but you have access to the mysterious secrets of the universe now. Walk boldly into the shadows, even if you are clueless about what you might discover. Pay careful attention to all the signs along the way; your heightened awareness helps to dissolve your fears and reveal rich spiritual rewards."
sagittarius,2015-05-05,"Your most reliable personal growth comes from focusing on your regular routine and simply performing your work-related chores as powerful Pluto trines the Sun in your 6th House of Details. Fortunately, you currently enjoy the idea of crossing one item after another off your list of things to do. Fulfilling your responsibilities is not only good for your self-esteem now, it also could have positive financial ramifications. Demonstrating your competence pays off in ways you can't imagine."
capricorn,2015-05-05,"You may be obsessed with the possibility of romance today, but it's not the wisest time to fall victim to unrealistic fantasies. Even if you want to escape the more mundane realms, there is work you must do first. Aside from feeling proud of your accomplishments, taking care of business works to your advantage in other ways, too. Since you are more emotionally satisfied when you have something tangible to show for your efforts, others will likely notice your improved demeanor. Instead of chasing your dreams to find happiness, your positive attitude may lure your dreams closer to you."
aquarius,2015-05-05,"Someone could be trying to support your efforts from behind the scenes today, but it's difficult to discern who it is or why they are doing it. It may not be a simple task to work with energy that you can't engage directly. Fortunately, you can make better progress if you just settle into the flow for a while, even if it feels awkward at first. You may be pleasantly surprised when you set aside your rigid agenda and place your trust in the unseen wisdom of a secret ally who has your best interests at heart."
pisces,2015-05-05,"You are swimming in unfamiliar waters of emotional intensity today. You might even panic for a moment, concerned that there's too much drama you don't understand. Nevertheless, your approach to the unknown is quite pragmatic now, even if you are unsure of where the currents may carry you. Whatever happens, don't let your need for clarity reduce the possibility of having an incredible experience. Instead of being distracted by the noise inside your head, listen to the stirrings of your heart."
aries,2015-05-06,"Fixating on your future goals makes focusing on the present moment impossible. Nevertheless, you're like a bee to honey today and you can't take your mind off the road ahead. Perhaps the temptation of so many lovely flowers is just plain irresistible. Nevertheless, ignoring your current responsibilities is not an option. Make whatever modifications to your schedule are necessary to reach your goals. Take care of business now so you can embrace your future later without any baggage."
taurus,2015-05-06,"There could be so many opportunities to seek pleasure today that it's confusing to know which route to take. You might even believe that your options have so much potential that you can't go wrong, no matter what alternative you choose. Thankfully, you may not be so far removed from the truth. You have taken the first steps on a very important journey that can be rewarding, both financially and emotionally, as long as you keep moving forward. He who hesitates is lost."
gemini,2015-05-06,"People naturally assume that you're having a good time but you're secretly worried about taking on too many commitments today. Your apparent indifference keeps others in the dark, but only for a short period of time. Once you lose your cover it may be time to face up to your real-world obligations. But this doesn't mean that everyone gets to tell you what to do. You retain the right to define what's on your plate. Drawing clear boundaries is the first step to regaining your power."
cancer,2015-05-06,"You might have an ingenious idea about how to make money today, only to discover that you are missing an important piece of information. Perhaps, in your eagerness to succeed, you just forgot something you already knew. But your current confidence is not a substitute for having a solid foundation on which to build. Fortunately, a trusted colleague could possess the rational perspective you lack. Taking the time to go over your assumptions with someone else may be all you need to put your thinking back on track. Mixing creativity with practicality is your ticket to success."
leo,2015-05-06,"Your presence is a gift to others today because you are able to maintain your positive attitude in spite of any problems you encounter. Fortunately, leading by example works well for you now as long as your enthusiasm doesn't get the best of you. You could become so passionate about the prospects of your current job that you end up spreading your energy too thin and losing ground. It's wonderful to motivate yourself with a big carrot at the end of the stick; just make sure that it's still within your reach."
virgo,2015-05-06,"Even if you are famously known for your efficiency on the job, following a goal-oriented schedule is not going to happen today. Your agenda might be to keep yourself on a straight and narrow path, but simple twists of fate continue to deliver disruptive messages about your place in the world. You are not meant to be a retiring wall flower now. Engage fully at every chance you get until a new course of action become apparent. Dance like no one is watching while you have the chance."
libra,2015-05-06,"Yesterday's uplifting ideas may be today's headaches. It's as if each innovative thought is like a hot air balloon that expands so much that it pops. Just as you were growing accustomed to the panoramic view, your fantasy disappears and you must come to grips with your disillusionment. Rest assured this reality check is all part of a larger process. Explore your options without putting all your eggs in one basket. If one door closes, another will open."
scorpio,2015-05-06,"Lofty career goals are not enough to inspire you today; what you need is some good old-fashioned magic. In fact, just setting the bar higher can have a chilling effect on your creativity now. If you're worried about missing your mark, you're not likely to take as many risks to express your imagination. Nevertheless, the well-traveled path isn't for you now; reach for the sky, but keep your faith or you might fall off your unicorn."
sagittarius,2015-05-06,"Sometimes making a new mess is more fun than cleaning up an old one. Unfortunately, you might have already turned your life upside down in a recent search for excitement. You have an eye for the extraordinary, yet putting all your resources into one inspiration now could very well spell doom for the project before it has a chance to get off the ground. Don't leave loose ends untied today, for your window of opportunity is closing fast. Unfinished business will grow harder to complete over the days ahead, so stop playing around and get to work."
capricorn,2015-05-06,"Your high level of competence can trick you into underestimating the time and resources needed to complete a job. Unfortunately, people may be counting on you now because they know you perform well under pressure. Meanwhile, you're trying to cover your error in judgment by working even harder to get things done. Don't act too surprised when something happens out of the blue today, releasing you from your impossible deadline and resetting your interpersonal dynamics at work. Be grateful for this unexpected gift from the universe and make the best use of your time."
aquarius,2015-05-06,"You're eager to cut loose today but you don't want to do it alone. Although others might be out to have fun, you're concerned that they won't be able to keep up with you. Unfortunately, you may be so zealous in your quest for pleasure now that you're prone to overindulge in food, drink or sensory stimulation. Unfortunately, too much of a good thing leads to trouble rather than satisfaction. Don't wait until it's too late;  set healthy limits while you can. Toning it down just a little brings you joy without any negative consequences."
pisces,2015-05-06,"Your confidence is soaring today, leading you to think you have all the answers at work, but you're not the only one ready to take charge. Instability could be brewing as conflict between the various strategies on the table seems inevitable. Unfortunately, resolving the disagreement could require more resources than  the project, itself. There isn't enough time to deconstruct every aspect of each proposal. Endless analysis may lead you in circles, while finding common ground is the obvious solution."
aries,2015-05-07,"You aren't happy with your busy schedule today, but you're resigned to take the more responsible path anyway. Nevertheless, you must confront your irrepressible temptation to procrastinate; nothing will be gained by distracting yourself from your current obligations. Thankfully, once you commit to wholeheartedly focusing your intentions, you gain the power to harness your unrealized potential and have a productive day in spite of yourself. Ironically, your mind is your weakest link and your greatest ally."
taurus,2015-05-07,"You are all set to put the finishing touches on a project today, but unless you are very persistent, things might not go according to your plan. There's a lot of mental interference in the atmosphere now and the noise could tempt you to ignore your agenda and follow a fleeting whim. Hopefully, you can override your need to escape by practicing a little common sense. You have an opportunity to turn a dream into reality if you pick one track and stay on it."
gemini,2015-05-07,"You may appear quite busy today, but others can't figure out why you're getting so little done. Oddly enough, you don't even notice that you're wasting energy running in circles. Fortunately, you can regain control of your day by consciously slowing down. Analyzing the consequences of your behavior prior to initiating action is much more effective than flying off the handle in every direction. Less hurry and less worry leads to higher productivity and greater self-esteem."
cancer,2015-05-07,"Although you can be quite cautious when it comes to revealing your feelings, it's refreshing to skip the never-ending analysis today. Normally, you prefer to contemplate all your options before doing anything. However, making every little decision as if you're playing a game of chess takes the excitement out of life. Give yourself permission now to react without concern for what happens next. Putting your emotions out on the table might bring more relief than you expect. Take a chance and open your heart."
leo,2015-05-07,"You might have committed to so many activities today that you don't know how you're going to manage your time. Your responsibilities grow more demanding throughout the day and your schedule becomes less forgiving as the afternoon unfolds. Nevertheless, avoid getting so caught up in your own agenda that you can't see a solution that's right in front of your nose. A healthy dose of adaptability allows you to accommodate unexpected changes into your calendar with a minimum of disruption. A positive surprise can occur if you give it room to manifest."
virgo,2015-05-07,"Your resolve grows stronger throughout the day, raising your confidence about a current project at work. Unfortunately, being productive isn't your only consideration today; you also want to enjoy yourself in the process. Be careful; don't use your personal desires to justify sabotaging your efforts if you're not having a good time. Stay on course and demonstrate your expertise. Ultimately, the satisfaction you derive from a job well done will be enough of a reason to celebrate."
libra,2015-05-07,"You're determined to complete your work but no matter how practical your approach, you still can see beyond the castle walls. Your perspective on life won't fit into a neat and tidy package now. In fact, you might even recognize how your current efforts merge with your future plans in a way you haven't yet grasped. You will do your best work in the long run by finishing on your own timetable, not someone else's. Fortunately, everything should fall into place if you maintain a high level of focus and an unwavering faith in yourself."
scorpio,2015-05-07,"You may grow agitated as you strive for perfection, especially if you find it hard to concentrate now. If you are tired from working so many hours on a project, take stock of what you have already accomplished and pat yourself on the back. Simply letting others know what you still have left to do alleviates the immediate pressure. Don't waste energy on self-judgment. A little extra rest is all you need today; tomorrow you will feel refreshed and ready for anything."
sagittarius,2015-05-07,"If you have been lax at work recently, it's time to reassess your priorities before continuing in your old ways. Although you want to put your life back in order, you could overcompensate and take on too much in order to prove your good intentions. However, the ambitious Capricorn Moon helps you plan your schedule with efficiency in mind. Make your energy last longer by taking a more methodical approach. Managing your time wisely allows you to work less and accomplish more."
capricorn,2015-05-07,"Your friends may be surprised with your uncharacteristic emotional intensity today. They might back off from a conversation to avoid conflict even if they think that you are wrong. Thankfully, the Moon's monthly return to your sign empowers you to express your vulnerable side without losing track of your goals. Nevertheless, do yourself a big favor and tone down your fervor. You don't have to push others beyond their comfort zone to stay passionately engaged with your meaningful cause."
aquarius,2015-05-07,"You could be drawn into a complex drama today and there might not be a straightforward way to avoid it. You may sink into your emotions and the more you struggle to be somewhere else, the deeper it gets. There's no need to panic; your smartest strategy is to stop resisting. Listen to what others have to say and don't put up unnecessary walls. Your gift is to be a sounding board now for those who need it most. Thankfully, the appreciation you receive in return touches your heart in ways you didn't expect."
pisces,2015-05-07,"Your obsession with one particular version of the future can impede your progress today. Or, you might grow afraid of being stuck on your current path, especially if you don't like where it's heading. In both scenarios, your attachment or avoidance intensifies the situation and makes it more challenging to navigate through the circumstances. Relaxing your expectations allows you to explore more options and regain a healthier perspective. Wider horizons lead to a happier heart."
aries,2015-05-08,"Your self-confidence is based on your practical outlook today; you know your strengths and understand what you must do to achieve your goals. However, you still may worry about the possible reaction to your direct approach. Although you might not mislead anyone intentionally, you're tempted to sidestep a delicate situation because Venus' shift into receptive Cancer increases your vulnerability. Nevertheless, your self-esteem could suffer unless you follow through with your original intentions and just get the job done."
taurus,2015-05-08,"You are motivated to bring a discussion out of the clouds and back down to earth today because you aren't interested in wasting time on philosophical issues or subtle nuances. For you, it's quite simple: pay attention to the place where the rubber meets the road. Gaining solid traction nearly guarantees that you will reach your destination in a timely manner. You continue to make progress as long as you return to the basics at the very first hint of trouble. Don't wait until you spin out of control before taking  action."
gemini,2015-05-08,"You might be feeling a little insecure today since charming Venus has left the chatty world of your sign and slipped into timid Cancer, where she remains for the next month. You may mistakenly believe that you have lost your edge, but nothing could be further from the truth. Although the pace of life is already starting to slow down, you will have sufficient opportunity to accomplish all you want over the weeks ahead. Remember, sometimes the most intelligent tactic is to say nothing at all and let your actions speak for you."
cancer,2015-05-08,"Naturally, you're more comfortable when there is an emotional resonance between you and others. However, you may grow annoyed today when you realize a coworker or friend isn't open-minded enough to accept your unconventional ideas. Unfortunately, your personal well-being might not be someone else's top priority now. Nevertheless, it's still worth your effort to share your true feelings. Even if the reaction isn't as supportive as you wish, you'll still gain respect for standing up for yourself."
leo,2015-05-08,"You'll have much more success today if you break each job into smaller tasks while the responsive Moon is traveling through your 6th House of Details. Instead of just jumping into a project spontaneously, it makes more sense now to have a  methodical frame of mind. Keep one eye on the big scheme of things so you always know what move you are going to make next. Although you may run into unexpected interruptions along the way, doing your homework before you get started minimizes the delays."
virgo,2015-05-08,"People seem to go beyond the call of duty to reassure you about your long-term dreams today. Their support is refreshing because your coworkers sometimes find fault with you for placing too much significance on the wrong things. Nevertheless, your current attention to details is not up for negotiation. Your confidence is growing now, but it's not helpful if favorable feedback goes directly to your head. The most reliable course of action is to continue demonstrating your integrity by being as productive as possible. Pride goes before a fall; a touch of humility saves the day."
libra,2015-05-08,"An intense domestic predicament might require your immediate attention today, but a dramatic show of emotions doesn't necessarily mean that anything is wrong. It's just that you could be afraid that personal issues will interfere with your job performance. Establishing firm boundaries empowers you to attend to matters at home and at work while keeping things separate enough so you don't create additional complications. Drawing a line between your two worlds helps to simplify your life."
scorpio,2015-05-08,"You're ready to enjoy a busy day, especially if you already have a solid plan in place for reaching your current goals. You're eager to jump in and work hard now because you're excited about the potential rewards. However, it's not wise to bank on a payoff before you even begin. Luckily, you should be able to fulfill your obligations today if you are realistic in your resource assessment and have a purpose that goes beyond material gain. As Einstein wrote, ""Not everything that counts can be counted."""
sagittarius,2015-05-08,"You have a pragmatic attitude toward money today and your incisive thinking all but ensures that you'll make the smartest choices. Nevertheless, your finances may be in need of some serious attention while the Moon hooks up with powerful Pluto in your 2nd House of Material Possessions. Unfortunately, impulse buying could quickly land you in trouble, so think twice before purchasing something you don't even need. The wisest approach to spending now is the most conservative one."
capricorn,2015-05-08,"You may run into more complexity than you bargain for if you assume a leadership role on a current project. Alternatively, you might feel upset because people expect too much from you. Logic tells you that you wouldn't have to work so hard if others did their fair share, too. Don't worry; you'll be able to join in the fun later, even if you are the one who does most of the heavy lifting all day long. Winston Churchill said, ""The price of greatness is responsibility."""
aquarius,2015-05-08,"You have a secret weapon at your disposal today; you can tap the hidden resources within your subconscious mind to make the most out of nearly any situation. The Moon's current visit to your dreamy 12th House of Fantasy inspires you to trust your intuition. It may not be apparent at first, but the variety of possibilities increases once you give yourself permission to dream big. However, you can't just ignore the current circumstances; consciously work within the constraints of the real world for the best results."
pisces,2015-05-08,"You might be very realistic about your goals today, but it's still complicated to manage whatever is currently on your plate. In fact, you prefer to live in the future rather than in the here-and-now. Keeping your dreams alive is absolutely critical, but you must also be ready to respond to each situation that manifests. Ultimately, it isn't wise to sever your connection with reality to focus on unfulfilled wishes about tomorrow. The only place you can effect change is in the present moment."
aries,2015-05-09,"You are a quick learner and thinking on your feet enables you to be quite comfortable in situations that would make anyone else uneasy. However, you may get your signals crossed today and make a rash decision based on a misunderstanding. Reality isn't as black and white as you expect; it's possible to see a lot of shades of gray. Acknowledging your lack of certainty lessens the pressure you might feel now. Instead of running with one of your spontaneous ideas, it's wiser to take your cues from others. You don't always have to be the leader of the pack."
taurus,2015-05-09,"You might not be able to make too much sense of recent events and have trouble shaking off a belief that you should know more than you do. You may have suffered during an emotional encounter, yet it's crucial now to concentrate on the present moment instead of the past. Don't look back; channel your energy into communicating your current perspective instead. Being practical works best for you, but don't shut out a good idea just because you can't back it up with solid facts. Sometimes faith is all you really need."
gemini,2015-05-09,"You feel like a pendulum swinging one way and then the other. If you have been too serious these last few months, you might be tempted to overcompensate today and show a more happy-go-lucky side. However, ignoring reality is not a smart strategy, even if you deserve to escape into your imagination. Indulging in a bit of fantasy can be emotionally healing now as long as you also acknowledge the importance of current events. The good news is that walking in two worlds comes naturally to you Twins."
cancer,2015-05-09,"Someone might be all over your case about your work or a relationship. But you don't really want reminders from people who don't know all the facts. You know exactly what you must do; your problem is that you currently lack the concentration you need to finish the job. If your willpower is flagging now, rest assured that you will have more energy in the days to follow. Although denial isn't a permanent answer, kindly asking others to back off today gives you time to find a solution on your own."
leo,2015-05-09,"People seem to have a lot to say today, but you may be so enchanted with your own world that you don't have the energy to connect with everyone else. However, in the spirit of friendship, you might take time to listen to someone's story, but it only serves to distract you from your inner work. Fortunately, you don't have to close yourself off completely from those you love in order to be true to yourself. Follow both paths at once; inspiration can be found anywhere you go."
virgo,2015-05-09,"Your thorough analysis usually enables you to make the best-informed decisions, but your thinking might be a bit too convoluted today for your own good. Rational Mercury flourishes when it has good data as its disposal, but your logic is somewhat confused by dreamy Neptune. You can swiftly turn even the most basic facts into subjective stories and the most accurate perceptions into impressionistic paintings. Once you accept that everything in life is illusory now, you will be able to be spontaneous and enjoy yourself in the present moment."
libra,2015-05-09,"Unfinished projects at work or home weigh heavily on your mind, especially if you have more obligations than you can meet today. There's no reason to waste your precious energy fretting about things you can't change if the demands being made on your time are unrealistic. Your fantasies may send you into a tailspin of doubt, but don't let them drive you to distraction. Rather than getting caught up in your fears, continue to demonstrate your competence without second-guessing your decisions. A positive attitude produces the best results."
scorpio,2015-05-09,"Although your perceptions are instinctively on point, you're likely to take them to a deeper and darker place than needed. Your imagination may run wild now and you could spend too much time lost in fantasies without conscious limits. No matter what, don't let your nagging worries turn into all-encompassing compulsions. If you find yourself obsessing over too many strange ideas, pull your energy back into the real world through physical activity or direct engagement with others. Flights of fancy are fine as long as you remember when it's time to return to Earth."
sagittarius,2015-05-09,"You may continue to experience pressure to take care of lingering financial matters today. Or, perhaps, you might derive considerable benefit from reevaluating what you have to give to others. Either way, be realistic about what you value and what you are worth. You are being offered a very small margin of error now; there's no room to fool yourself. A mistake in judgment will likely cycle back to haunt you pretty quickly, so take your time and get it right. Finding peace of mind is priceless."
capricorn,2015-05-09,"There's no reason to set your sights so high today that you set yourself up for failure. Even if you have time to focus on your goals, you still cannot accomplish everything you want. Part of your current dilemma stems from the wide gap between reality and fantasy, with little ability to distinguish between the two. The fact is you are a human being, possessing irrational emotions that can't help but affect your thinking. Lighten up and grant yourself temporary permission to daydream -- even if it negatively impacts your productivity. Exploring your imagination is the first step to understanding your heart."
aquarius,2015-05-09,"Although you might be unable to keep your mind from wandering today, your unexpressed thoughts can teach you exactly what you need to know. However, you must be totally honest with others and tell them you are not in the mood for socializing now. Sharing your truth prevents anyone from expecting more from you than you can give. There's no need to fear the dark corners of your brain, for they hold the keys to the most amazing lights of inspiration."
pisces,2015-05-09,"You wish you didn't have so many commitments today because you're not interested in engaging in lighthearted conversations upon command. Nevertheless, it's not wise to postpone an event because you'll probably feel more inclined to participate once you get there. You don't have to fake a pleasant attitude; if you are in a serious frame of mind now, just be exactly who you are. Others will appreciate your honesty and integrity, making you grateful that you don't have to hide your true nature when among your friends."
aries,2015-05-10,"Although you are widely known for your impulsive behavior, your current social involvement is probably more considered. Your motives might not be obvious, but you could go out of your way now to cooperate with people to hide your fear of rejection. Unfortunately, this uncharacteristic strategy won't likely lead to the results you seek. Instead, adopt a radical approach by expressing your feelings and letting the cards fall where they may. Others find it easier to converse with you when you are upfront and honest right from the start."
taurus,2015-05-10,"You might not act very friendly today because you don't want to engage in long discussions about your feelings. However, carefully choosing what to say and what to keep secret offers you the illusion of being in control. Your plan could backfire when people realize you're holding back, prompting them to push you toward the very same dialogue you're trying to avoid. But there's no reason to get tangled in complex webs of denial. Showing up with an open mind and no expectations all but ensures pleasurable interactions."
gemini,2015-05-10,"Meeting people's expectations may seem like an uphill battle, but you don't know how to sidestep the climb. Fortunately, your entire agenda could change in an instant once you realize it's not about pleasing anyone else. It turns out that you're the only one who might be disappointed by your performance today. Others are more likely to accept you unconditionally than you may think. Striving to maintain high standards is worthy of your efforts, but don't let any one goal get in the way of your happiness."
cancer,2015-05-10,"You attempt to mask your current hypersensitivity by throwing yourself into your work today. You think no one will notice your feelings if you impress others with your efficiency. However, your friends are less interested in what you accomplish now than how you communicate with them. Your magic stems from expressing the tenderness in your heart so forget about demonstrating your proficiency. Producing tangible results will not create your legacy. In contrast, the positive effects of nurturing those you love will last a lifetime."
leo,2015-05-10,"You're not inclined to reveal your deepest feelings now because you don't believe that others really care about what matters most to you. It seems as if everyone always wants to be around you when you're in a playful mood, but it's hard to find a companion who wants to stick around when you have more serious things on your mind. Unfortunately, hiding your desires restricts your inner child, turning you into a party spoiler. Ultimately, you're better company when you show your true colors and wear your big heart on your sleeve."
virgo,2015-05-10,"You have a unique way of getting your chores done today and you don't need anyone's approval to move forward with your plan. You might even take your non-conformity one step too far now by alienating someone, as if you're testing the limits of a friendship. Even if your intentions are honorable, people could take your actions the wrong way. Don't complain if others aren't willing to put up with your antics; change your attitude instead. Creating a sense of community begins with you."
libra,2015-05-10,"You may have a mother-hen complex; you want to take care of everyone today even if you can't fit another chick under your wings. But your desire to protect the people you love might be more about gaining respect now than demonstrating your compassion. Examine your heart before trying to save another lost soul. Unless you're acting with integrity, you could do more damage than good. But if your motives are pure, you can be a superhero in the eyes of those you help."
scorpio,2015-05-10,"Your reluctance to reveal your secrets might create unnecessary distance between you and someone you like. It's not that you want to be alone today; it's just that you may choose to keep your heart hidden from others if you don't feel deserving of love. However, there's no need to create a self-fulfilling prophesy by pushing the all-or-nothing button. Instead, take a small step toward creating a lasting friendship. A solid foundation built on vulnerability and trust allows a relationship to develop over time."
sagittarius,2015-05-10,"Showing your softer side is nearly impossible when others make too many demands on your time. Unfortunately, your friends and relatives might grow annoyed today because you are more interested in being clever than being real. Although you have the witty repartee working on your behalf, the current dynamics are exacerbated if you suppress your feelings. Don't waste time trying to determine who is to blame. Shift the energy by opening your heart to the potential of connecting in the present moment. Taking the high road inspires others to do the same."
capricorn,2015-05-10,"Keeping your emotions under wraps seems natural, especially if you think that expressing them could interfere with your plans. However, someone very close to you might be in immediate need of your help. Unfortunately, you can't avoid the drama by simply ignoring his or her disclosure; this misdirected strategy only inflames the situation. Attempts to control the flow drive the feelings deeper and amplify their power. Although it's counter-intuitive, openly communicating your desires breaks old patterns and positively transforms the dynamics for everyone involved."
aquarius,2015-05-10,"You might believe you can act as unconventionally as you feel today, but your eccentric behavior won't go unnoticed. In fact, your friends may be seemingly harsh in their current judgments. You don't need to worry about the opinions of others today; you only have to be true to yourself. And although you're not responsible for anyone's reaction, your kind concern still goes a long way toward mending the fences that make good neighbors."
pisces,2015-05-10,"Hiding your desires behind a stoic presentation won't necessarily fool anyone who really knows you. People can see right through your performance because your deep sensitivity shows in your eyes. Instead of wasting precious resources pretending to be something you are not, let your inner light shine. You might not be everyone's cup of tea, but at least they will know what to expect from you before it's too late. Expressing your vulnerability is not a sign of weakness, but one of strength."
aries,2015-05-11,"It feels as if you're standing on the edge of an emotional cliff trying to decide whether or not to jump. You intuitively believe that you'll be safe as you fly toward the ground, yet the adrenaline rush is exciting. However, this mysterious gravitational tug with the unknown is also be a bit scary. You're not as confident once you enter the feeling realm, especially if you don't think you're in control of the situation. Nevertheless, your experience can be meaningful and memorable if you're willing to take a risk with your heart."
taurus,2015-05-11,"You may be drawn into an intense situation at work today that pits your solution to a dilemma against someone else's. An emotional drama could ensue if you aren't willing to give an inch as the fixed Aquarius Moon squares the obstinate Taurus Sun. It helps to acknowledge you don't have all the answers, even if being flexible isn't your first choice now. Forget about being right; instead, focus on what you can learn by collaborating with others. A team effort produces what you can't do alone."
gemini,2015-05-11,"You are tempted to tip-toe around a delicate topic of discussion today. However, you can unintentionally bring up unpleasant memories for someone close to you if you can't face the underlying emotional conflict. Forget about using humor to avoid the subject because making light of your feelings only impedes your progress now. Overcome your fears and search for lasting solutions rather than patching things up with a superficial band-aid. Taking a more spiritual approach allows the real healing to begin."
cancer,2015-05-11,"You aren't interested in creating any emotional conflict, but you believe that stepping onto unfamiliar ground now can lead to a greater satisfaction. You might need a bit of help from a friend or lover to assist you through your resistance today, but your fears should dissipate once the conversation gets underway. Remember, there isn't a right way to respond as long as you're true to your heart. There's no need to bury your feelings in order to follow your dreams."
leo,2015-05-11,You need to connect with your passion in order to reach your goals today. You are on an emotional journey that requires courage and you may have to confront some painful issues to truly feel alive. Just remember to express your thoughts without making anyone else feel guilty. You can effectively engage in an open dialogue while acknowledging that others don't need to agree with your point of view. There are many routes to the top of the mountain so don't worry if you're on the path alone.
virgo,2015-05-11,"It might be your intent to stay neutral in a conflict if someone tries to engage you in a struggle for control today. Unfortunately, maintaining the peace becomes increasingly difficult, especially if you feel your authority is being threatened. Even if you want to avoid escalating the situation, your emotional detachment can only last so long. Although you shouldn't have to suppress your feelings, taking a few deep breaths prevents you from saying something that you regret. Coming from a place of joy raises the vibration for everyone involved."
libra,2015-05-11,"Your friend or coworker places you in an uncomfortable position today, pestering you to share something you intended to keep private. The stakes are too high now to play games; the smartest strategy is to express your true feelings rather than acting as if everything is just fine. Ultimately, a difficult conversation clears the air of unspoken tensions, paving a path toward a more meaningful connection. Communication is the essential ingredient for relationship success."
scorpio,2015-05-11,"You might inadvertently test the boundaries of loyalty or love by generating the emotional intensity that's currently absent from your life. But your desire for passion could have the opposite effect on others today. If people believe that you are being too aggressive, they may withdraw, motivating you to apply even more pressure. Although denying your feelings isn't a healthy strategy, it would be smart to soften your approach. Practicing a little diplomacy now goes a long way to creating stronger relationships."
sagittarius,2015-05-11,"You're fascinated by the power of your own feelings today. However, your common sense encourages you to retreat when you get close to emotions you can't control. These conflicting desires create a bit of a paradox because you can't experience the magic if you're unwilling to fall into the shadows. Don't even pretend that you're in charge when you're not. Expressing your vulnerability opens a doorway to intimacy now that was previously hidden from view. Take a leap of faith and follow your heart."
capricorn,2015-05-11,"It's not a simple task to explore your sensual desires because they may take you deeper than you want to go. The evocative Moon agitates passionate Pluto today in its long-term visit to your sign. It's apparent that there are no absolute limits now and arbitrary rules won't make your heart feel any safer. Thankfully, your willingness to dance with the unknown empowers you to delve into the uncertainty of your feelings, bringing you one step closer to emotional satisfaction."
aquarius,2015-05-11,"You thought past memories were safely hidden away, but they could explode into your consciousness now, shattering your illusion of emotional detachment. Needless to say, this mental shift is disconcerting since you are much more comfortable when your rational mind is in charge. It's no use trying to put everything back as it was. Instead, be responsive to whatever happens today by openly expressing your feelings. You can always reclaim your cool intellectual demeanor tomorrow. Building solid relationships requires you to be in touch with your heart."
pisces,2015-05-11,"You yearn for a deep emotional connection, but the intensity of the moment may be more than you bargained for today. Although you're eager to explore unfamiliar territory in search of love, you wish that things were simpler when it comes to relationships. Nevertheless, taking a risk by sharing your feelings with someone you admire demands courage. Luckily, the cost is worth it, since you just might discover a precious gem that can help heal your heart."
aries,2015-05-12,"Confusion catches you off guard today if someone you trust seems to be working against you. You might think that everyone's on your side, only to find that complex interpersonal dynamics are hidden from your view. The antidote to your current struggles may be as simple as renewing your commitment to the mutual good of all involved. A stressful aspect between pushy Mars and controlling Pluto leaves little room for selfish behavior. Voicing your intent clearly could be the catalyst that ameliorates the drama and allows you to return to your work sooner than you expect."
taurus,2015-05-12,"Your dreams are so lifelike today that you're unsure of who or what to trust. You want to build your future on a firm foundation, not on whimsical fantasies. In fact, you may quickly grow uncomfortable when you realize how much the real world is influenced by your imagination now. Fortunately, you can refocus your energy by consciously waking yourself up from your reverie. Paradoxically, it will be easier to relax once you are busy producing tangible results."
gemini,2015-05-12,"The solution to a job-related predicament may come to you as a vision today. Or, maybe a dream is instrumental in helping you see what to do next. However, you must proceed with caution now; you can create chaos if you just accept anything that pops into your head as the truth. An unverified hunch will lead you in the wrong direction if your thinking is warped by your colorful fantasies. Having a vivid imagination is a gift, but only if you substantiate your decisions with hard facts. There's no substitute for solid data when it comes to your work."
cancer,2015-05-12,"Sticking to your schedule is nearly impossible today because you prefer to spend time in unhurried contemplation rather than letting the clock determine your next move. Unfortunately, daydreaming about your ideal future is not the most effective way to manifest it. However, completely denying your desire to drift off into fantasyland isn't the answer, either. Rearranging your calendar and powering through your responsibilities early in the day gives you a chance to experience the best of both worlds."
leo,2015-05-12,"You have plenty to learn from delving into the shadows of your subconscious today, but it might not be obvious how to do it. Undoubtedly, it would be nice if you could simply beam yourself into another dimension and back again on command. Although you normally benefit by activating your imagination, you can't slip away if others are expecting you to be productive now. Maintaining your center of gravity and showing up as required enables you to take your much-needed spiritual journey later on with a clear conscience."
virgo,2015-05-12,Your coworkers may be a source of deep frustration today because they don't seem to support your plans. You could be overwhelmed with how much you have on your plate right now and you want to focus on being as efficient as possible. But people seem to float in and out of your day without concern for what you're trying to accomplish. Don't rely on anyone else to jump in and help you; establish your objectives and follow your path on your own. Demonstrating your determination and drive sets the tone for the days ahead.
libra,2015-05-12,"Focusing on your work isn't a simple task today because your mind is wandering off to other times and places. Ironically, the more you force your thoughts back into the present moment, the more distracted you become. Keep in mind that willpower alone won't fix your lack of concentration now, so go ahead and surrender to your daydreams for a while. You will return to reality brimming with inspiration, prompting your productivity to soar to new heights."
scorpio,2015-05-12,"You don't want anyone dictating your schedule today because you plan to take some time off to play while the reflective Moon dances with imaginative Neptune in your 5th House of Fun and Games. The problem is your current wish may go unfulfilled because others are depending on you now and you must demonstrate your reliability. Fortunately, with a little extra effort and a touch of magic, you can keep up appearances while still escaping into your dream world at the same time."
sagittarius,2015-05-12,"You know you can't float off into the clouds today; your feet must remain on the ground so you can perform at your very best. However, you may have a tough time meeting your responsibilities now. Thankfully, you know exactly what needs to be done, but you're also aware that everything could grow more complex once you start your project. Remember, you can make more progress if you don't try to control every aspect of your work. Have faith; your goal is within reach, even if it takes a bit longer than you initially planned."
capricorn,2015-05-12,"Your creativity has a magical life of its own today, yet you might not be able to manage your schedule with any sense of consistency. As soon as you begin to work, you may realize that you're moving into uncharted territory. However, if you assume you know where you're going, you could inadvertently miss the energetic wave completely. Sometimes it's the journey, not the destination that matters. Letting go of your fear and trusting the process is the ticket to your success."
aquarius,2015-05-12,"You might doubt your own wisdom today because everything seemed so simple at first. However, it's obvious that you must stabilize your recent growth or you could risk losing the ground you have already gained. Adhering to your original agenda makes good sense, but only up to a point. Following your intuition and reconsidering your direction is the smartest thing to do now. But don't try to change everything all at once or you'll set yourself up for disappointment. Allowing the experience to unfold naturally enables you to enjoy the present moment more."
pisces,2015-05-12,"You can't hide your true intentions today because others can see straight through your attempts at secrecy. Although the Moon's conjunction with vulnerable Neptune in Pisces makes you feel hypersensitive, your fears may be worse than any real danger. Don't waste your energy protecting yourself from those who mean no harm; instead, work to build your self-esteem so the opinions of others won't impact you negatively. Honoring your integrity is the best way to ensure your emotional security."
aries,2015-05-13,"Starting an argument with a friend today isn't in your best interest, even if you believe he or she is hiding something from you. You could unintentionally turn a small oversight or a simple misunderstanding into a full-blown crisis if you're worried about being left out of the action. However, jumping to conclusions about other people's motives isn't wise. Don't expect everyone to always include you in their plans, especially when you are often quick to express your need for independence. Live and let live."
taurus,2015-05-13,"You won't likely be successful in your current attempts to control the unseen energies today. You might even blame your topsy-turvy day on your friends, but their lack of follow-through isn't your problem. Own up to your role in manifesting the chaos you are attracting to stimulate your creative expression. But don't assume you know how others will act; take full responsibility for your part alone and move on."
gemini,2015-05-13,"Conversations may be jumbled today and to make matters worse, other people can easily misinterpret your actions. However, there's no need to criticize anyone, especially since your behavior is sending ambiguous signals, anyway. Although you think you're being straightforward, it's not worth starting a fight about something that will seem ridiculous later in the week. Taking a wider view of current events helps you put things into proper perspective."
cancer,2015-05-13,"You're ready to release your old worries and meet the world with an optimistic attitude today. But your emotions may flow so freely that you find yourself in an awkward position, causing you to tighten up your defenses. Unfortunately, your natural sensitivity to change might prompt you to overreact and shut down more than is necessary. Nothing is gained by reverting to past fears. Bring your thoughts back to the present moment; staying in touch with your heart is essential for your personal growth."
leo,2015-05-13,"You may need to confront an interpersonal issue today that could impact other areas of your life if left unchecked. However, it's harder to develop a sensible strategy when you don't know how deep everyone's feelings run. Instead of jumping in to fix the situation, moving away from the center of the storm helps you find clarity. Once you see things from a more objective viewpoint you can decide which path to take. Sometimes inaction has the most positive impact on the course of events."
virgo,2015-05-13,"Relationship dynamics are overly complicated today, especially if no one seems to be playing according to the rules. You might not understand everyone's behavior until you take the time to listen to what is being said. However, your discussions must move beyond surface disagreements for them to have any value, so don't get distracted by the apparent differences of opinion. Once you push past the tension, it's easier to create the harmony you seek."
libra,2015-05-13,"Your energy is all over the map today, making it difficult to finish your tasks on the job and your chores at home. Although you might not be too concerned if your productivity is low now, others could be relying on you to hold up your end of the deal. Don't minimize the role you play in the lives of your coworkers and friends. If you promised to do something, do it. Honoring your commitments is important for more reasons than you think."
scorpio,2015-05-13,"There is weird energy in the air today with respect to rekindling a current relationship or your sudden attraction to a new one. Either way, you are well-served by removing your rose-colored glasses before something regrettable happens, rather than after it. Flying along with your head in the clouds is only fun until you run into a mountain that you didn't know was there. It's essential to see things exactly as they are now and not how you want them to be. Fortunately, you're up for the task; a high level of focus and courage allows you to work your special brand of magic."
sagittarius,2015-05-13,"A family squabble about an insignificant issue still requires a piece of your mind share today. Nevertheless, others seem to be more anxious about the outcome than you are. Your lack of concern might confuse them, especially if they think your priorities don't include them. However, you might be uncertain about your position while you gather more information. Rather than saying nothing and letting everyone draw their own conclusions, openly express your interest, while still reserving your judgment until you have more facts. No matter your final decision, everyone will be relieved once they know you care."
capricorn,2015-05-13,"You're currently so involved in so many activities that you might not even realize how packed your schedule is until it's too late. Unfortunately, you can't finish everything all at once unless you avoid scattering your attention. Be wise and counterbalance the hectic pace with a steady hand and a singular focus now. Don't bother trying to solve the problems of the world or attempting to save the day with your clever brilliance. Instead, remember that it's a gift to be simple when it comes to setting priorities."
aquarius,2015-05-13,"You might experience unexpected resistance from friends and colleagues who think your current strategy is not the best one. You don't mind a healthy sparring match to get your creativity flowing, even if someone cajoles you into seeing things from a different perspective. However, you're not as easygoing once you realize that your opponent has no intention of negotiation. You're eager to heed sage advice, but you're not inclined to let anyone make critical decisions for you. Accept the constructive feedback with a smile, and then follow your heart."
pisces,2015-05-13,"You may surprise others today with an unexpected emotional disclosure because the evocative Moon is hanging out in your fishy sign, bringing your moods right up to the surface. A close ally might not like what he or she sees now and could morph into an adversary. Luckily, you have the emotional maturity to handle this delicate situation by acknowledging criticism without being overly defensive. Do your magic and defuse a possible conflict before it even happens."
aries,2015-05-14,"Your waiting period is over -- or is it? You might rush headstrong into a new project or a new relationship, only to discover that all the pieces aren't quite in place. You may have to do a quick reassessment and modify your plans accordingly. Unfortunately, it's going to take more than a quick fix to get everything right. Don't give up; committing to a goal is more important than ever, even if your timetable still needs revision. Ultimately, your passionate determination will bring the rewards you seek."
taurus,2015-05-14,"You're done with being in charge; you gave it your best and now you're ready to step out of the spotlight. However, your change of strategy has nothing to do with lessening your commitment. In fact, you can be more effective today by working behind the scenes. Keep your shoulder to the wheel and your eyes on the prize. Success will be yours if you stop worrying about what others think of you and focus on your dreams."
gemini,2015-05-14,"You're overflowing with enthusiasm today until suddenly you see the elephant in the room. Although its presence is a game-changer, reconstructing the past is a waste of time when instead, you should get busy and decide what you're going to do next. It may be an uphill battle at first, but time is on your side as long as you don't panic. You enjoy a good puzzle more than most; figure this one out and you'll be a winner before you know it."
cancer,2015-05-14,"You might think that if you just put your head down and work harder today you'll meet your obligations without making waves. However, obstacles may appear on multiple fronts today, preventing you from moving forward. It takes a special kind of courage to look directly at the source of a problem, yet that's exactly what's required. Avoid the impulse to react immediately. Take your time and create a solid plan based on logic and facts. Common sense and patience are your best allies now."
leo,2015-05-14,"You may feel wildly romantic today, but someone's serious demeanor prevents you from acting on your emotions. Although you might believe your happiness is tied to realizing your current fantasies, not every desire is worth pursuing. Back away from the intensity of your passion so you can see the bigger picture now. Releasing your attachment to immediate gratification makes room for a deeper level of satisfaction in the not-so-distant future."
virgo,2015-05-14,"You're ready to kick some butt today but your uncharacteristic fierceness may dissipate in the face of resistance. Paradoxically, the stronger you come on to others in the pursuit of your professional goals, the more obstructions you encounter. You could exhaust yourself trying to prove that you mean business. Don't suppress your enthusiasm; instead, channel your passion into your work. There's no stopping you once you find a cause you believe in and a pace you can sustain."
libra,2015-05-14,"Letting everyone know how you feel isn't all that complicated unless you stop to consider how they might react. Obviously, you prefer to play nicely with others and are not inclined to go out of your way to push anyone's emotional buttons. However, your feelings are what they are and shouldn't be denied just because they are inconvenient. Maintaining a harmonious alignment between your behavior and your heart is valuable. Being willing to work through the consequences of your actions is priceless."
scorpio,2015-05-14,"It's time to shake up your regular routine, especially if your daily habits are not helping you to reach your full potential. You need to listen to your inner rhythms so you can march to your own drumbeat. However, there are additional people involved and this presents a dilemma. Nevertheless, the first step toward harmony is to be aware of the differences between your values and the beliefs of others. But don't let self-righteousness stand in the way of negotiating a satisfactory solution. Once all assumptions are out on the table, you're on your way to creating a new workflow that's beneficial for all."
sagittarius,2015-05-14,"It doesn't surprise you when people criticize your choices because your lifestyle doesn't always conform to their expectations. However, the tables may be turned today as others see a more serious side of your personality. The funny thing is you might actually feel cheerful as you take on a project that makes your heart happy. But your relentless drive to produce results could be misinterpreted as an unwillingness to have fun. Nevertheless, you can have your cake and eat it too if you just continue to visualize your success."
capricorn,2015-05-14,"The energy doesn't lighten up today as you continue to struggle to meet looming deadlines. Your first instinct is to bury your emotions, leaving you more mind space to concentrate on the work at hand. Unfortunately, you still could bite off more than you can chew, dispersing your energy rather than focusing it. Reevaluate your commitments early in the day and adjust your schedule as needed. It's better to be honest with others up front than to disappoint them with delays later on. Maintain your integrity at all costs."
aquarius,2015-05-14,"You could be so excited about the variety of possibilities today that you lose sight of your real goals. But in your haste to squeeze more into your day, you might inadvertently create impediments to your progress. You can take on so many projects that you don't succeed at any of them. Avoid the temptation to put lots of irons in the fire. It may feel counter-intuitive, but your smartest strategy now is to eliminate all non-essential activities. Paradoxically, doing less enables you to accomplish more."
pisces,2015-05-14,"Although you might be working harder than you expected, you have very specific goals in mind now and will do nearly anything to achieve them. Unfortunately, you can't sustain the high level of energy you are currently expending or you'll burn out before you fulfill your objectives. You might be tempted to shift into overdrive today in order to make better time. However, there are no shortcuts to success; you are running a marathon, not a sprint."
aries,2015-05-15,"You attempt to convince others that you're right today by making bold assertions about your capabilities. However, your enthusiasm isn't a substitute for the practical work that's required to reach your goals. You should be able to overcome most any resistance you encounter now, assuming you haven't aimed too high. Nevertheless, don't expect immediate results, for lasting success will take more time and effort than you thought. Instead of talking about your plans, get busy and show everyone what you can do."
taurus,2015-05-15,"You are motivated to accomplish a lot today, yet it might not be easy to sustain your efforts over the long haul. Luckily, even if you start to feel worn out, you can reach into your deep spiritual well for more inspiration to urge you onward. However, you could lose hope if you run into apparently insurmountable obstacles. Nevertheless, you're eager to apply yourself now and show your true colors. Have faith; every mountain top is within reach if you just keep climbing."
gemini,2015-05-15,"You're sorely tempted to take a shortcut today, hoping that no one will notice you've left the beaten trail. Although you might think you're clever enough to pull the wool over everyone's eyes, your subterfuge will only last a short while. Unfortunately, outsmarting reality by exerting control over the current situation won't help you achieve your goals. Moderate your temper and your over-the-top confidence with a healthy dose of pragmatism in order to make the most progress."
cancer,2015-05-15,"You might not feel like you're on top of the world today, but it's wise to fake an air of confidence, anyway. You could earn respect and admiration from your peers because of your ability to see the positive potential in each situation now, rallying everyone to your cause. But don't exaggerate your ideas, or you may lose credibility when others realize you can't fulfill all your big promises on a timely basis. It's currently more advantageous to offer less and deliver more."
leo,2015-05-15,"You can sell clear blue sky and ethereal rainbows to anyone, even if there's nothing but gray clouds in sight. However, your blind optimism could become problematic today if you start to believe your own hype. Unfortunately, your unflagging confidence and determination won't be enough now to make all your dreams come true. Instead of cultivating pie-in-the-sky expectations, just quietly work toward manifesting the future as you see it. Impress others with your actions, not your words."
virgo,2015-05-15,"You're uncertain about which thoughts to share today because you don't want to rain on everyone's parade. Even if you're not the one to deliver the bad news, you're still not fooled by all the people who are admiring the Emperor's imaginary new suit of clothes. However, there's no need to play the role of the naysayer now; it's more prudent to remain silent. Don't waste your energy arguing with those who can't see reality in its true light. Channel your frustration into managing your own business, instead."
libra,2015-05-15,"Others might be quick to support your efforts, even if you are still questioning your own decisions. You don't have to buy into the grandiose thinking that seems to pervade your world today, however, your current self-doubt can eventually take its toll. Be smart and adapt your own analysis to incorporate the best parts of someone else's hopeful dreams. Inspiration can be found in the  unlikeliest of places and the strangest of times."
scorpio,2015-05-15,"You can turn one little thought into a complex philosophical treatise. In fact, you're capable of rationalizing nearly anything today, making you an incredibly effective negotiator. Unfortunately, it's challenging to see the shadow side of a situation until it's too late. Nevertheless, don't cling to an idea once you realize that it doesn't make sense. You can waste valuable time and significant energy if you are too rigid in your thinking now. Keeping an open mind allows you to make the most of an unexpected opportunity when it knocks on your door."
sagittarius,2015-05-15,"You aren't necessarily living up to your role as the optimist of the Zodiac today. The problem is you don't have all the answers, even if you can visualize the wonderful possibilities ahead. In fact, you're extremely realistic now, enabling you to also grasp all the potential pitfalls that lurk just out of sight. Relax; your negativity will likely dissipate prior to your fears gaining ground. Once you adjust your attitude, you'll be back to your sunny self before you know it."
capricorn,2015-05-15,"You are masterful enough to find solutions to the trickiest questions today. However, the reflective Moon's presence in your 4th House of Home and Family urges you to escape the spotlight for the sake of privacy. Thankfully, you can still work wonders without calling too much attention to yourself. If your plan is viable, you will be able to tell others about it later with a real sense of authority. Keep everyone guessing for now; your power grows even stronger with silence."
aquarius,2015-05-15,"The fact of the matter is that your joyful enthusiasm makes it nearly impossible to be practical today. Although you're certain you can pull off nearly anything you put your mind to now, you may have a rude awakening if you take on more than you're able to handle. Unfortunately, you might have to call upon superhuman efforts just to meet your current obligations. But instead of falling short of your promises, avoid making too many commitments in the first place. Doing your best at one thing is better than sacrificing quality while trying to do it all."
pisces,2015-05-15,"Someone's tactics could clash with your values today, yet you won't accomplish anything positive by turning a minor disagreement into a major conflict. Even if you believe your strategy is a better alternative, engaging in a power struggle won't create the opportunities you seek. Demonstrate your wisdom by retreating without a lot of fanfare, fine-tuning your plan and then trying again when everyone is in a more cooperative mood. Timing is everything."
aries,2015-05-16,"You have a romantic plan in mind that includes someone you love, but he or she might not be all that cooperative when it comes to manifesting your dream. Although you're tempted to use the art of persuasion, there's no need to push your agenda today. The first step is to observe your changing emotions without feeling like you must act on every whim. Nevertheless, just because others aren't willing to join you now, you still have a good chance of finding satisfaction on your own if you choose your goals with great care."
taurus,2015-05-16,"You are likely to learn a lesson in compassion today as gentle Venus harmonizes with ethereal Neptune. However, this kind of dreamy idealism doesn't come naturally for you Bulls since you prefer to play it safe in the real world. Stretching outside of your comfort zone is well worth the effort now. Widening your perspective and opening your heart won't place you in any real danger while the practical Taurus Moon is here to keep you grounded. Helping others is a powerful spiritual practice."
gemini,2015-05-16,"Someone you admire may become your close friend, but first you must be willing to engage him or her in a way that moves beyond the superficial. Others won't likely accept your charm as a substitute for a real heartfelt connection today, so don't let your nonchalant attitude distract you from sharing your hopes and dreams. Instead of laughing the moment off, enjoy the beauty of the emotional support that is available to you by embracing the unknown."
cancer,2015-05-16,"Life seems so lovely when you get to sit back and soak in the admiration of others today. Nevertheless, you must also speak up if you expect someone to know what you really want. You might be longing to express your desires but you need to be more comfortable before you reveal anything too deep. If you're feeling emotionally insecure now, you could clam up and slip away before anyone notices your retreat. Your current challenge is to stay one hundred percent present even when you feel vulnerable. Make the most of the cosmic spotlight and tell others what's in your heart."
leo,2015-05-16,"You may be swept off your feet today and could even fall in love at first sight. However, the entire romance might occur only within your imagination. You're hesitant to share your feelings with anyone else now because you can't see anything positive coming from revealing your fantasies. Give yourself permission to explore your desires now, whether or not you express any of them out loud. Listening to your heart is a good place to start, but only time will tell if a relationship is meant to last."
virgo,2015-05-16,"You can't maintain your typical rational perspective today because you're too busy daydreaming about a perfect romance. And to make matters worse, you are struggling to put your desires into words. Unfortunately, interactions with others seem too shallow now to allow you to express the depth of your feelings. Nevertheless, don't give up before you even try. Convey your message by whatever means possible; the right person will understand your point perfectly and you will feel better just for being heard."
libra,2015-05-16,"It's a good omen when your friends encourage you to do the very same things you've been talking about doing for a long time. Fortunately, you have a lovely opportunity to extend the influence of your magic today in lots of unexpected ways. You could be running on a creative high now, especially if others appreciate your artistic talent and aesthetic eye. Do whatever is necessary to motivate yourself into action while the cosmic momentum is pulling for you. Take center stage and shine like a star."
scorpio,2015-05-16,"Your basic nature normally prevents you from evading intensity and sidestepping unpleasant issues; however, you're tempted to keep everything light and easy today. You see great potential everywhere you look, and you don't want to mess with your current positive trajectory. Remember, your suppressed feelings can be expressed in a gentle manner that's constructive instead of destructive. Your timing and the tone of your voice make all the difference in the world now when it comes to discussing a difficult topic."
sagittarius,2015-05-16,"You're walking on the sunny side of the street today and everything seems to sparkle with magic. However, it's all too easy to get lost in a fantasy now, especially if it offers you some of the emotional security you seek. As much as you want to be loved, your need for adventure may stir up uncertainties about your current relationship situation. The more you ignore your concerns, the more intense they become. Paradoxically, staying in touch with your discomfort actually improves your day on several levels. Being authentic is more rewarding than being perfect."
capricorn,2015-05-16,"You don't like the idea of letting down your guard today, even if you secretly would like to try. You are drawn to explore a potentially positive experience, but you feel safer when you play within the formal rules of engagement. Unfortunately, your current dilemma won't be solved by flipping a coin and making a simple all-or-nothing choice now. Carefully observe when you clench your jaw, contract your muscles or hold your breath. Consciously engage your heart, instead of unconsciously closing it down."
aquarius,2015-05-16,"You want to surround yourself with the finer things in life today, but it's tough to find the time to pursue pleasure when you still have so many chores to do. Thankfully, you have sufficient energy to do your work; however, your unexpressed desires still could get in the way. Unfortunately, the more you try to concentrate, the more insistent your fantasies become. Stop resisting this call from your imagination and focus on ways to make your dreams come true, instead."
pisces,2015-05-16,"You might consider pursuing a romantic relationship now, in reality or within your fantasies. Or, you may be passionate about your current involvement in a creative endeavor while enchanting Neptune trines artistic Venus. Don't worry about what others think because they are busy trying to navigate their way through the planetary haze. You, on the other hand, can see things as you wish them to be, rather than how they are today. Your limitless imagination is a gift as long as you are aware that you're wearing rose-colored glasses. Dreams are wishes that your heart makes, but it is up to you to choose which one to chase."
aries,2015-05-17,"Luckily, you can effortlessly balance your social life with your current obligations as long as you pare back your expectations. Rather than aimlessly wandering through your day, create a viable plan to finish the most important chores still left undone. Managing your time efficiently frees you up to spontaneously accept an invitation to a fun event. Your key to happiness today is minimizing the distractions and only doing what makes your heart content."
taurus,2015-05-17,"You have the power to turn a potentially busy day into a very relaxing one, even if you have specific things you must cross off your list. Although circumstances may test your mettle, the sensible Taurus Moon helps you maintain a positive attitude. You won't be deterred from reaching your destination, since you're able to effortlessly take everything in stride now. Your mission is simple today: do what you must, but carve out some time for a memorable adventure as soon as you get the chance."
gemini,2015-05-17,"You might think that someone is hiding the truth from you now that the Sun and Moon are busy conspiring in your 12th House of Secrets. You're content to dig around in the shadows today as you search for clues to your latest mystery. The lack of tangible data leads you to conclude that others are withholding important information. Although your suspicions are largely unfounded, a miscommunication can still send you on a strange detour. Thankfully, untangling the puzzle will be easy enough if you follow your intuition and ask the right questions."
cancer,2015-05-17,"It's not about the quantity of friends you possess; it's the quality of the relationships that sets you apart. Luckily, the solid Taurus Moon's presence in your 11th House of Community means your social life should be relatively stable now. Feeling emotionally secure is especially important today and it makes you happy when you can lean on a few trustworthy friends. Enjoy the warm camaraderie while you luxuriate in the love of those who believe in your dreams."
leo,2015-05-17,"A close friend or relative may enlist your support today because you seem to be capable of holding your position with grace when the going gets tough. Thankfully, no one expects you to have all of the answers; just lending a friendly ear is more than enough now. Although it isn't the best time to give advice, you can offer a valuable alternative point of view. Even if you're uncertain how to proceed at first, your unwavering loyalty makes a world of difference."
virgo,2015-05-17,"You might overlook what someone wants today because you have a very particular notion of your perfect day and you're already well on your way. Unfortunately, your friends may not understand your current choices and the interpersonal dynamics can  get complicated quickly if you don't take the time to explain yourself. However, your narrow focus on your agenda prevents you from seeing the obvious. Slowing down to empathize with others enables you to emotionally connect with those you love."
libra,2015-05-17,"You may think you know the exact recipe to make your partner happier or your friends feel better. But personalizing someone else's problems can lead to plenty of frustration. Unfortunately, linking your satisfaction to others is a complicated business that could leave you feeling emotionally drained and depleted. The trick is to be a sympathetic listener and offer sincere support without trying to fix anything. Showing that you care is all that really matters."
scorpio,2015-05-17,"No matter how high your confidence level is today, it's still wise to remember that your perspective is only one point of view out of many. It isn't that you have drawn an incorrect conclusion; it's just that there are many roads leading to an infinite number of destinations. Reality isn't always as fixed as it appears. Flexibility is your ally now, for new possibilities will appear sooner than you expect. Keeping your options open improves your chances for success."
sagittarius,2015-05-17,"You could become so obsessed with making something special happen today that you become limited by your goals, rather than inspired by them. However, the current situation may play out much differently than you expect. You are more willing to shift your approach when you balance practicality with inspiration. Altering the direction of your arrows of intention while they are already in flight is not only possible -- it might be your most ingenious move yet."
capricorn,2015-05-17,"You are quite capable of delaying personal gratification when you are motivated by a long-term goal. However, today's presence of the Sun and Moon in your 5th House of Spontaneity indicates that you're now ready to put pleasure ahead of responsibility. Fortunately, you Goats may be the best planners in the zodiac, but you also know how to live in the moment. Don't wait for the approval of others; simply revel in the abundant joy available to you as if you have been rehearsing for this dance your entire life."
aquarius,2015-05-17,"You may experience mixed emotions about domestic commitments that restrain your freedom. Nevertheless, a solid home life can be a significant blessing while the moody Moon is hanging out in your 4th House of Roots. Family relationships feel like a double-edged sword because the potential rewards go hand-in-hand with heavy responsibilities. Tread carefully; you won't have to eat your words tomorrow if your frustration doesn't lead you to make any foolish declarations of independence today."
pisces,2015-05-17,"Your rendezvous with destiny is right on schedule, even if it doesn't appear on your calendar today. You might be hesitant to make major changes to your routine now, especially if the big pieces are already in place. Nevertheless, you feel a growing pressure from within and realize that sooner or later you will have to acknowledge what's in your heart, even if it messes with the stability of your personal life. Fortunately, those who love you will encourage you to follow your soul's true calling."
aries,2015-05-18,"Building your nest egg is at the top of your list as the solid Taurus New Moon highlights your 2nd House of Resources. The cosmic emphasis is on your personal finances for the month ahead, so take stock of your assets and put your accounts in order. However, the judgments you make about yourself impact your earning power more than you think. You can add value to your life by considering what you have to offer to others and how they perceive you. But a one-time fix isn't the answer today; revisit your progress regularly in the days ahead to generate the prosperity you seek."
taurus,2015-05-18,"You have a special opportunity to see yourself clearly today as the New Moon falls in your sensible sign. You have a rare chance to reevaluate how you process your emotions which can change your life for the better. But unless you act on your newly found self-awareness right away, you might slip back into old patterns. Maintaining strong protective defenses may no longer be appropriate. Your life will grow richer and more rewarding as you consciously share your vulnerabilities with those you can trust. Your heart is like other muscles; it gets stronger when you use it."
gemini,2015-05-18,"It's time to uncover any thoughts you have secreted away in your subconscious mind, for some of these hidden stories can now be told. The Taurus New Moon falls in your 12th House of Privacy, yet moving emotions out of denial and into a shared reality deepens the intimacy in your relationships. Mercury's retrograde turn might tempt you to sidestep the intensity by intellectualizing your feelings; instead, seize the moment and open your heart to those you love."
cancer,2015-05-18,"Surrounding yourself with allies seems like a natural thing to do while the Taurus New Moon activates your 11th House of Community. Spending time with a group of like-minded people happily sets the social stage for the next few weeks. However, you still might doubt your decisions today, but don't let that stop you from following through with your initial intentions. Trust your original instincts now, push through any fears and keep moving your energy outward. The world is a better place with you in it."
leo,2015-05-18,"Although it's your time to shine in the public eye, you may want to hide from the attention once you get it. Today's Taurus New Moon occurs in your 10th House of Career, casting a spotlight on your professional life for weeks to come. But you might be afraid that you won't be able to live up to everyone's expectations once they see who you really are. A healthy amount of humility works as an asset, but your uncharacteristic self-doubt only gets in your way. Fortunately, you will stand up to the scrutiny as long as you are honest and open in you interactions with others."
virgo,2015-05-18,"You are pulled in opposite directions as you attempt to be practical and philosophical at the same time. The earthy Taurus New Moon encourages you to be dependable, yet its influence on your 9th House of Big Ideas destabilizes your plans. Meanwhile, mischievous Mercury's retrograde turn makes it tougher to resolve the opposing forces. It takes practice to keep your feet on the ground while aspiring toward the heavens. Fortunately, you can soar to new heights as long as you give yourself extra time to honor both approaches."
libra,2015-05-18,"Courage is your secret weapon as the fixed Taurus New Moon fortifies your 8th House of Transformation. You have enough staying power to stick to your position long enough to discover significant truths about who you really are at your core. This is not about anyone else, although others may come into your life to push you deeper and pull you into uncomfortable emotional realms. Have faith; you can emerge from this challenging phase with important insights that positively impact your everyday life if you're willing to trust the process."
scorpio,2015-05-18,"You want to pursue your own interests today, yet might not be able to get the alone time that you crave.

Ultimately, initiating this emotional dance is more healing now than anything else you can imagine. A flower cannot blossom without sunshine and man cannot live without love."
sagittarius,2015-05-18,"Focusing your energy on the nitty-gritty details of life can be annoying for you philosophical Archers. Today's utilitarian Taurus New Moon triggers your 6th House of Habits, presenting you with opportunities to improve your diet and exercise program. Oftentimes, you are so intent on understanding the big picture that you forgetfully brush aside the more practical concerns. Once you see the mundane things clearly, use your I-can-do-it attitude to carry out your plans. Where there's a will, there's a way."
capricorn,2015-05-18,"You might feel more capricious than usual today, yet your current lightheartedness won't totally override your serious outlook on life. The Taurus New Moon emphasizes your 5th House of Creativity, motivating you to loosen up enough to enjoy pursuits that are close to your heart. Although you may grow preoccupied with expressing your inner child now, just take the fun in stride with your commitments. All play and no work makes a Capricorn uneasy. Striving for balance is healthier for everyone in the long run."
aquarius,2015-05-18,"Celebrating your own personal renewal shouldn't be taken lightly, especially as the Taurus New Moon rejuvenates your 4th House of Roots. Even if you have a full day of commitments on your calendar, you can still escape from your regularly scheduled responsibilities to be with your loved ones for a while. Or, maybe you just want to be by yourself. Either way, make yourself comfortable without creating too many distractions. It's not about the quantity of time you spend honoring your emotional needs, it's all about the quality."
pisces,2015-05-18,"There's no reason to be self-critical if you can't settle into a routine today. The Taurus New Moon in your 3rd House of Communication brings a constant stream of information into your life, making it tough to relax.

Thankfully, the simple act of setting priorities enables you to establish that previously elusive rhythm. Once you've handled everything close to home you'll be free to pursue the exciting distractions of your choice."

It's not time to turn a dream into reality now. Mercury's retrograde in your 3rd House of Information gives you a chance to let your thoughts and ideas come and go at their own pace without any need to make major decisions or initiate action just yet. Explore all your alternatives and take comfort in the fact that you don't have to choose one today."
taurus,2015-05-19,"Your most ingenious money-making schemes probably look better on paper now than they do once you try to put them into motion. But don't throw the baby out with the bath water; there may be a real jewel buried among a pile of half-crazy ideas. Keep mulling the various possibilities around in your mind. Don't get lazy and let one go because it's not perfect. However, getting swept up in a feeling of urgency is your biggest threat to success. Time is on your side, so let the developmental process take its own organic course."
gemini,2015-05-19,You may experience moments of dread now when you start to believe that time has run out and you've missed a once-in-a-lifetime chance. You are tempted to bring others into your drama today as if they might have the answer to your current dilemma.

Shift your focus from the most immediate tasks to the more long-range ones. Perspective is your friend in more ways than one.
cancer,2015-05-19,"Capturing the magic of your imagination these days is a challenge worth rising to as cerebral Mercury back steps through your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Schedule time to meditate, dance or listen to music so you can sink beneath the superficial noise in your head and into the creative waters of your subconscious. But you may not get tangible results overnight. Establish a daily practice of quieting your thoughts so you can reach the land of enchantment anytime you want. Dreams today, reality tomorrow."
leo,2015-05-19,The danger of thinking about the future is expecting it to arrive in the present. Your mind is so active now that it's difficult to shut off your imagination -- and the fantasies look so wonderful that you want them to come true today. Consciously take a few steps back from your own mental machinations while Mercury is retrograde in your 11th House of Goals. There's no need to forget about your aspirations; just acknowledge that it's healthier to treat them as dreams now rather than plans. The ones worthy of manifesting will continue to gain momentum over the next few weeks.
virgo,2015-05-19,"You may be frustrated by your lack of progress at work, especially if you didn't receive that promotion or raise you wanted. You're inclined to share your emotions with one of your colleagues, but this open communication could backfire on you. Others might even see you as overly ambitious or self-indulgent if you reveal your feelings. Don't close down your heart, but keep it protected from needless drama. Remove the disappointment by realizing Mercury's retrograde is in your 10th House of Career, delaying the good news for a few weeks. Don't throw in the towel; you still can reach your goals, but not on your original timetable."
libra,2015-05-19,"You want to proudly announce your plans for the next chapter of your life. You might have dreams of climbing the tallest mountain or crossing the widest desert. Or, perhaps, you're ready to crack the books and earn the degree you've always wanted. However, it's too soon to talk about your ambitions; if you do, you could unintentionally dissipate the energy. Continue working on your big adventure behind the scenes. Seek support from others only after your facts are in order and your strategy is bulletproof."
scorpio,2015-05-19,"You are entering a planetary power zone where your ideas carry extra weight, but the emphasis on your thoughts is not without possible pitfalls. Becoming caught in a cycle of doubt can spiral out of control unless you consciously intervene. Mercury is retrograding through your 8th House of Transformation, inviting you to reassess the efficacy of your deepest emotional patterns. Reinforce the behaviors that are working for you, but relinquish those that are not. You hold the potential for positive change in your own hands if you're willing to let go of the past."
sagittarius,2015-05-19,"It might seem as if someone is picking a fight with you, but you may be extra sensitive to other people's words today. It's likely that you could jump to a faulty conclusion or misinterpret a message as communicator Mercury dances backward through your 7th House of Partners. Don't be overly concerned if you find yourself having the same conversation again and again as you try to untangle a misunderstanding. Naturally, it's even better if you are extra cautious in all conversations now to avoid trouble before it happens. If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
capricorn,2015-05-19,Your uncharacteristic inattention to details can cause your best-laid plans to go awry now. You might have too many commitments that spread your energy too thin. Or you could just be so eager to begin a project that you make fast assumptions instead of doing the research. Don't let your ambition get the best of you while mental Mercury is retrograding through your 6th House of Service. Building your foundation on solid facts and meticulous follow-through takes your work to the next level.
aquarius,2015-05-19,"Words come easily to you today, prompting you to express your heart in a romantic manner. But you have so many wonderful visions that it's nearly impossible to pick just one and run with it. Consequently, you may get frustrated with your inability to share your emotions. Unfortunately, your angst could even close down the flow of positive feelings. However, Mercury's retrograde in your 5th House of Play might reignite an old flame rather than firing up a new one. It's not important whether you are moving ahead or backward now; shine your love light wherever you go."
pisces,2015-05-19,"Your hypersensitivity presents you with an irreconcilable dilemma today. You may know how someone close to you feels even before they tell you. It's as if you can actually hear their thoughts when messenger Mercury is moving backward in your 4th House of Family. No matter how strong your psychic radar is now, it's still crucial to check out your hunches instead of just assuming they are right. It's a blessing to use your non-verbal antenna to tune into the emotional dynamics as long as you also initiate a conversation to validate the truth."
aries,2015-05-20,"Contrary to popular belief, you Rams can also behave like lambs; your gentle way of caring for those you love is obvious while the watery Cancer Moon softens your harder edges today. But nurturing others requires that you tend to your own needs, too. Instead of adding to your current stress by attempting to be everything to everyone now, slow down and be good to yourself. The seed of love is first planted at home."
taurus,2015-05-20,"Although you're feeling positive about your future today, there's still a serious streak within you that might find its way to the surface. It's not wise to blindly set your fears aside, for your concerns may be based on very real experiences from your past. To deny them is just plain foolhardy. Nevertheless, it's healthy to remember that current events are not identical to previous ones. Increase your options by carefully noting the differences between then and now. Reassessing your strengths and weaknesses inspires you to fulfill your potential."
gemini,2015-05-20,"You're riding some pretty intense cross-currents now, like an eagle gaining altitude while effortlessly gliding on the thermals. However, you may be carrying extra baggage in the form of unresolved feelings and the extra weight can turn easy soaring into a struggle against the prevailing winds. Fortunately, you have the ability to transform lingering negativity into something that motivates you. Shining the light of your awareness into the dark empowers you to overcome your last inch of resistance."
cancer,2015-05-20,"Allowing your past memories to surface can deepen your emotions today and add power to your reactions. The tenacious Cancer Moon may look back with nostalgia, yet your fear of the unknown needn't distract you from your current experience. Sometimes surging feelings are so overwhelming that they tempt you to shut out others, even the ones you love the most. However, it's different now because your recollections can be used as a source of inspiration to help you reach your goals."
leo,2015-05-20,"You may have a spring in your step and a twinkle in your eyes today, even if you're not sure why. Although nothing significant has changed, you feel more trusting now, believing that the most important issues will simply sort themselves out on their own. In the meantime, you can't let go of your previous obligations. Nevertheless, it helps all the way around to maintain your joyful demeanor, even while taking care of serious business. The contagious smile on your face is your not-so-secret weapon."
virgo,2015-05-20,"Significant changes are in the air, even if you think you're quite content with the status quo. Although you want to avoid any form of confrontation, letting someone else dictate your needs now is not an option. There's no reason to mince words; be specific when talking about what your heart wants. If you state your case clearly and have a sensible plan to back up your intentions, you could very well improve the quality of your life before you know it."
libra,2015-05-20,"Your path might be obscured today as you try to chart a course between your emotional needs and your obligations to others. Your positive attitude can make all the difference in the world. People may withdraw their support if you don't think you can realize your goals. Paradoxically, others will jump in to help clear the way if you are feeling competent. Fortunately, you excel at getting along with your peers; being a team player now is your ticket to success."
scorpio,2015-05-20,"You may be currently working harder than you prefer, leaving you little time to enjoy the finer things of life. People might see you as more emotionally self-contained than usual, but that isn't necessarily how you feel on the inside. Although your determination to keep everything running smoothly can be your greatest asset now, don't be afraid to step out and have a little fun. There's no need to make a big deal of your plans as long as you commit to add some adventure into your routine. Variety is the spice of life."
sagittarius,2015-05-20,"Strong undercurrents of emotions today could make you afraid that you're going to be pulled off course by your own zest for life. Paradoxically, giving in to your exhilaration now can actually propel you in your desired direction. Let your enthusiasm give you the extra energy boost that you need in order to accomplish everything you promised. Don't hold back; allow your rising optimism to carry you to success."
capricorn,2015-05-20,"Marginalizing your feelings isn't a viable strategy today, even if you seriously distrust the unreliability of subjective perceptions. Naturally, you prefer placing your faith in hard cold facts. However, it's time to tap into the emotional wisdom you often dismiss. Your intuition is opening now, so don't be afraid of listening to a hunch that comes from within. Push forward on your own, even if you're unable to justify your actions to anyone else."
aquarius,2015-05-20,Alternating mood swings can rock your day. One minute you're lost in deep meditation as you recall feelings from the past and apply your memories to the present circumstances. The very next moment has you wondering who you're fooling when you slip away into your imagination. Acknowledging the polarity is essential today; give yourself enough freedom so that your mind can seamlessly move between these two extremes. This contemplative practice ultimately empowers you to see things with more clarity and wisdom.
pisces,2015-05-20,"Your compassion is working on overdrive today, tempting you to bury your heart in the sand to cope with the pain and suffering. Instead, take the exact opposite approach and fully engage the outer world. You have little time to waste silently worrying about others when you could be volunteering in the community, fundraising for an altruistic cause or just lending a helping hand to someone in need. Putting your good intentions to work now is healthier than indulging in idle fantasy."
aries,2015-05-21,"You may struggle with an inner conflict today between your desire to hang out with friends and a need to stay true to yourself. You crave the casual camaraderie that comes from socializing with your peers, yet you aren't willing to risk your emotional security by spending extra time away from your home and family. Rationalizing your behavior doesn't change the circumstances. However, you can get the most out of the present moment if you simply decide to stop fighting with yourself. It's all in your mind; life is what you make it."
taurus,2015-05-21,"The tables are turned now because you could actually be too adaptable rather than overly stubborn. Perhaps you are just tired of struggling and have little patience to explain  your stated position. However, too much flexibility might get in the way of your happiness now. You must take the credit or the blame for your present condition, but don't waste your energy regretting previous actions. The time to hesitate is through; let go of your past so you can welcome your future with open arms."
gemini,2015-05-21,"The frantic pace of your life picks up today as the energizing Sun returns to your sign, stimulating a higher frequency of love. Take any sweet moments as they come, for the pressing need to make a decision won't let you check out whenever you so desire. Think about what you could learn. Pursuing your passions without committing to any one particular path isn't as easy as it sounds, but it's exactly what you need to do now."
cancer,2015-05-21,"You can feel the stress intensify as the necessity to change confronts your current plans. But don't rush to resolve the tension; instead, reconsider what you really want to do or you could end up making the situation even worse. You might not be able to separate a good fantasy from reality now, so avoid making any significant plans for a couple of days. There's nothing wrong with waiting until you clearly know how you feel before initiating your next move. Lay low and count your blessings."
leo,2015-05-21,"Your social life is re-energized today by the brilliant Sun's shift into your 11th House of Groups. Instead of being concerned with your personal calendar, use the next few days to increase your involvement with the larger issues of your community or even humanity itself. But remember there's no right or wrong when it comes to your life path. Instead of fretting about trivial things now, just focus on alleviating the pain and suffering of someone close to your heart. The joy you experience from helping others is its own reward."
virgo,2015-05-21,"You're temporarily distracted by one minor event after another now that three planets are dancing through restless Gemini. But rather than trying to force an issue by placing yourself smack dab in the middle of a complicated situation, take the solitary route, instead. Relax your focus and follow your thoughts wherever they may take you. Unfortunately, trying to constrain your mental process only leads to frustration. Ultimately, you will find the right solution by demonstrating your patience and listening to your intuition."
libra,2015-05-21,"You're ready to pack your bags and head out on a much-needed vacation now that three planets are joining forces in your 9th House of Adventure. Unfortunately, you might be so loquacious that you could occupy all your time and energy talking about your ideas instead of actually going anywhere. Don't just get lost in your daydreams today; take a first step toward manifesting travel plans that can still bend a bit with the changing tides of your life. It takes more than words to make your dreams come true."
scorpio,2015-05-21,"You could be confused by people's inconsistent feelings today. The ever-shining Sun joins a cosmic party that's already spicing up your 8th House of Transformation. Even your close friends might seem elusive now if you attempt to address your concerns directly. You could even make an error in judgment while assessing the current situation, prompting you to take an ineffective course of action. Don't waste time analyzing what went wrong; if you don't at first succeed, try, try again."
sagittarius,2015-05-21,You may experience existential conflict as you reconsider your current work duties in relationship to the personal circumstances of your life. Your rational mind is so purposeful now that you could overlook the advice of your friends and partners as you search for a solution to your dilemma. Stay open to hearing someone else's point of view as long as it's based on facts. Reestablishing harmony between home and career isn't as hard as you think when you're on the side of truth.
capricorn,2015-05-21,"Although you want to find time for personal enjoyment, there's too much on your calendar now even for a quick escape. Cover as much ground as you can on all your projects, but don't stress about having unfinished business when the workday is over. It feels as if your life has become a series of powerful transformations. You're not who you once were, yet you aren't the person you are still becoming. Treat yourself with kindness even in the midst of conflict because real change takes time to unfold."
aquarius,2015-05-21,"There's little you can do to prevent someone from going through his or her own angst now when adapting to a new situation. Thankfully, you can be quite comfortable with the idea of making big changes in your life when necessary. However, just the thought of having to deal with another major shift is upsetting today because of all the uncertainty in the air. Don't project your fears onto anyone else; just stay attuned to your own process and allow others to do the same."
pisces,2015-05-21,A specific tactic in managing relationship dynamics that once worked particularly well for you isn't necessarily as useful now. There's no reason to hold on to memories that only bring you sadness. Let your thoughts bubble into consciousness one last time and then leave them in the past where they belong. Your current ability to emotionally detach while staying intellectually engaged could save the day. Carefully analyze the whole situation to locate a piece of common ground upon which everyone can stand.
aries,2015-05-22,"You don't necessarily excel at following rules, but you must pay attention to them now or suffer the consequences. The lines are printed in a coloring book for a reason, even if you rebel against the idea of staying within them. Self-control counts far more than anything else these days, so establish clear guidelines and stick to them. Keep in mind that reaching your long-term goals is more rewarding than the temporary satisfaction of immediate gratification."
taurus,2015-05-22,"Even if you believe you must act with authority, don't get so enamored with your role that you end up alienating your closest friends and family. Undoubtedly, maintaining your integrity when it comes to ethical issues is important, but it's dangerous to force your beliefs onto others. Take your commitments seriously, but remember that compassion and cooperation are necessary components if you want your voice to have a positive impact on the people in your life."
gemini,2015-05-22,"Slowing down and doing a job methodically doesn't come naturally to you busy Twins; you want to bolt ahead to the next compelling activity rather than learn an important lesson. Nevertheless, you won't likely feel free to follow your own heart until you deal with a lingering relationship issue. Your big ideas may be knocked down a notch or two by someone in a powerful position. But don't get discouraged; this is not about defeat. Restrictive circumstances are giving you a chance to become even more effective as you rework your plans, limit your options and create a more stable future."
cancer,2015-05-22,"An emotionally intense interaction with someone at work could precipitate deep contemplation on your part. You may wonder how to cultivate more supportive business relationships. It's not that anything in particular is wrong; it's just that you're determined to get your needs met even if satisfaction seems too far away. Soften your stance and let go of any self-criticism for now while you reevaluate all your alternatives. If you can imagine it, you can find a way to make it happen."
leo,2015-05-22,"The weight of responsibility falls upon your shoulders today and you can't decide whether to stand up even taller or just collapse under the pressure. However, giving up is not a viable option now. Bear the heavy burdens as best you can or they will grow more cumbersome over the next few weeks. Just be sure to use your common sense and draw a line when absolutely necessary. Know your limits and then communicate them clearly to those around you if you want things to change."
virgo,2015-05-22,"You are aware of exactly what must be done today, but you may be inhibited by your previous commitments to others. People might not understand the hardship you are experiencing and it's not necessarily wise to tell them now. Thankfully, you can surprise everyone with your high level of perfection. No one rises to the challenge better than you when it comes to performing under pressure."
libra,2015-05-22,"Channeling your creativity into practical endeavors is critical today because you could otherwise fritter away an important opportunity. Even if you feel like your brilliance is bottled up, you can overcome your mental blocks to success by declaring your unwavering determination. Don't allow non-believers to tell you what you can't do. Nodding yes in agreement only encourages them. Defend your right to reach for the stars; once you've gathered enough information, taking a calculated risk makes the most sense."
scorpio,2015-05-22,"Stand up tall and assume your rightful place within your family, workplace, or local community. Even if you are uncertain about your capabilities today, this isn't the time to give them voice. Instead, express your vision as optimistically as you can. Naturally, reality may constrict your dream to make it fit into your life, but don't sell yourself short before you start. Your confidence alone could inspire others to grant you the support you need."
sagittarius,2015-05-22,"Many people don't share your cavalier philosophy and they worry about your future well-being. You might not want to hear the opinions of others as you attempt to gloss over their negativity. Nevertheless, it's crucial to acknowledge the advice you receive in a matter-of-fact manner and use it to improve your plans, if necessary. Visionary thinking may be your strong suit, but your ideas will simply drift off into space if you don't find a way to ground them in reality. This is a wonderful opportunity to create lasting changes if you have the sense to grab it before it's gone."
capricorn,2015-05-22,"Working harder may be your instinctive answer to the heightened stress now, but there's a point at which additional effort just isn't worth it. Knowing when to stop today can mean the difference between happiness and sorrow. You could feel great about your contribution if you simply give it your best shot and then relax and reflect upon your accomplishments. Taking your responsibilities seriously is one thing; carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders is beyond the call of duty."
aquarius,2015-05-22,"Your antennae are extended as far as they go now, but you're not necessarily picking up the desired signals from your favorite station. You might prefer dance music, but instead are receiving serious cautionary lectures that make you wonder if you're on the right path. Be patient and respectfully listen to the voices of authority, but remember that ultimately you are your own boss. Remain open to the incoming message, but turn the radio off once you've heard it and follow the beat of your own drums."
pisces,2015-05-22,"Evading your professional duties is nearly impossible today, even if the personal goals you have in mind are more worthy. You might have to get serious, buckle down and fulfill your immediate obligations before undertaking a more charitable endeavor. Even if it seems overwhelming at first, making a concrete plan improves your chances of pursuing a full spectrum of activities. Anything is possible if you believe in yourself and are willing to show up and do the work."
aries,2015-05-23,"You may not catch up with your chores as quickly as you wish today, for you are preoccupied with pleasure rather than production. Thankfully, you might have the right idea about getting the distractions out of your system sooner than later. If you have a lot to do now, you won't be able to procrastinate forever. Nevertheless, returning to your unfulfilled obligations with a happy heart enables you to accomplish more in the long run."
taurus,2015-05-23,"Domestic tasks are on the front burner today, including paying bills, emailing friends and even cleaning your home. However, you might not make measurable progress by the end of the day because you're probably slow to get started, making it harder to get ahead. Nevertheless, your determination builds to a mid-afternoon crescendo, motivating you to finish strong. Just remember that everything could take longer than you expect, so cut yourself some slack instead of setting goals you cannot reach."
gemini,2015-05-23,"You might be stubbornly clinging to negative feelings about an unfinished conversation, but it's wiser to let go of yesterday's news and move on. You have other fish to fry now, and there's no time to replay an interaction that didn't go as you wanted. However, you could end up frustrating yourself today if you think you can somehow make everything right. Planning for new successes throughout the coming week is much more useful than worrying about the past."
cancer,2015-05-23,"It's dangerous to jump to conclusions without getting your facts in order because once you make up your mind today you're pretty certain that you are correct. Unfortunately, you could become a victim of believing your own hype now. The good news is your breadth of vision can fuel the most amazing discussions on a variety of interesting topics. Although your conversations might be quite fascinating, specific comments that remain unsaid may speak volumes. Sometimes, silence is louder than words."
leo,2015-05-23,"Responding to the fallout from your anger could be a sore spot that resurfaces every now and then. However, you might believe that you already dealt with the original source of the problem. Luckily, you can count on your friends and relatives for support, which may be sufficient to guide you through these rough waters. Lean on the shoulders offered, but take full responsibility by learning from your past mistakes. Gracefully adapting to the changing tides demonstrates your magnanimity and your willingness to grow."
virgo,2015-05-23,"Relaxing isn't as simple as it sounds these days because your unfulfilled commitments have piled up since Mercury turned retrograde a week ago. Although you're buzzing all over the place, you probably wish you had several additional days packed into your weekend. Aside from wanting to accomplish more, you also need more time to think. Nevertheless, your time for contemplation is coming to an end. Instead of waiting for that magic moment, jump into the flow of activity and figure it out along the way the best you can."
libra,2015-05-23,"Making a long-term plan can be tough now because several things you want to do interfere with existing obligations. You have one-too-many exciting choices in front of you, complicating matters even more. But don't let anyone tell you that you must decide your future today, since it's advisable to keep your options open for a while longer. There is currently a lot of clear blue sky around you, making everything seem better than it is. Wait until a few clouds return and see where the shadows appear before going on record with your final answer."
scorpio,2015-05-23,"Your anger may simmer beneath the surface all day, especially if anyone tries to talk you out of your feelings. Uncharacteristically, you're willing -- even eager -- to change your mind today, but only on your own terms. If others don't take the time to ask you what you want, then you won't likely be ready to compromise. However, if someone is really interested in your perspective, you can be more open-minded now than anyone expects. A little mutual respect does the trick."
sagittarius,2015-05-23,"Establishing your top priorities is not a piece of cake today, especially if you're unprepared to make an important decision yet. It's not that you should forget about your objectives; it's just you have a lot to gain now by following an intelligent friend or partner for a while instead of heading off on your own. Don't worry about a missed opportunity because a new situation for advancement at your current job is likely. Paradoxically, easing off on your grip solidifies your current position and positively impacts your future."
capricorn,2015-05-23,"Don't be afraid to ask for advice as you navigate through uncharted territory today. It's nearly impossible to make sense of everything because there could be so many possibilities, leaving you overwhelmed and exhausted from trying to figure it all out. Your stress multiplies if you believe that your current choice must be finalized now. Rest assured that you can still change your mind later without as much difficulty as you think. Show your courage and dare to be yourself."
aquarius,2015-05-23,"Instead of booking your schedule so tightly that your entire day is locked down, try moving the energy by giving yourself more flexibility today. The easiest way to shake things up is to leave blocks of time completely unstructured to do as you please. It may also help to reexamine your motives for keeping so busy every moment of the day. Remember, you don't have to put lots of activities on your calendar now in order to be considered a success. Not all those who wander are lost."
pisces,2015-05-23,"Revealing your feelings helps dissipate any lingering negativity; however, you could easily go overboard in the other direction now by pretending everything is just fine. However, don't whitewash the truth just because it's not pretty. Instead of trying to anticipate people's reactions, concentrate on the accuracy of your message. Avoid the temptation to share your personal information as a way to get your friends and workmates to take notice. Your only real option is to take the high road and work for the good of all."
aries,2015-05-24,"Restraining your impulses is exhausting work, reminding you of your ongoing struggle with impetuous behavior. However, it's more difficult to withhold your desires now since your charm seems to be working wonders on those around you. Your effervescence can lead to trouble because your passion might be overpowering to your audience. Enjoy the show you are putting on today, but don't overdo it. Sharing the spotlight is a simple way to empower others to express themselves, too. A little bit of give and take makes the day more memorable for everyone involved."
taurus,2015-05-24,"You can become obstinate about defending your values today while the Moon is in fixed Leo. You could unconsciously get stuck in an old emotional conflict or consciously redirect your focus toward the outer world. Instead of staying within your comfort zone, take a chance now and express your feelings in an unconventional way. The stress dissipates if you shake up the energy and create a special experience with friends or family, especially if you're willing to adapt to changing circumstances. A spontaneous mindset serves you well."
gemini,2015-05-24,"A larger-than-life gesture on your part can have a big positive impact on those around you today. However, coming from a place of sincerity is essential because your plan will backfire if your actions are just a calculated performance for the sake of eliciting a particular response. There's no reason to force an issue just for the effect. It's definitely not a good idea to pull the wool over anyone's eyes if you want to maintain your integrity. Instead, just shoot from the heart and hope for the best."
cancer,2015-05-24,"Oddly enough, you may reach deep into your imagination now, but your behavior is still motivated by a sense of practicality. You're inspired to create something tangible, but could get mired down by all the logistics today. Nevertheless, it's still advisable to maintain your connection with the magical and spiritual realms. Energize your actions with your most wonderful dreams but don't confuse fantasy with reality in the process."
leo,2015-05-24,"You're acutely aware of your emotional needs while the Moon is activating your dramatic sign. An old pattern of extravagance might resurface now, so resist unnecessary indulgences so they don't become the main focus of your day. Besides your apparent attraction to others, your feelings can connect you to your powerful yet private inner world. Sharing your secrets isn't necessary today, but that doesn't make them any less real."
virgo,2015-05-24,"A pragmatic idea might come to you today in a dream. Or maybe a glimpse of your future is caught for a moment in the diaphanous web of your imagination, making you feel as if you are recovering a treasure from unknown realms. Normally, you're quite logical, but setting aside your need for rationality opens new doors of creativity now. Remain receptive to any messages that originate from your subconscious, even if you can't understand them right away. Intuition works in mysterious ways."
libra,2015-05-24,"Your creative urges are stirring and it's wise to make the most of these feelings while they last. Whether you pull out the colored pencils, acrylic paints or your camera, try to capture your vision as vividly as possible. It doesn't matter what medium you use; your current assignment is to recognize beauty where you see it and to express how it influences your heart. Even just listening to your favorite music can be enough to transport you into the spiritual dimensions that are beyond the physical world. Your imagination is a fertile ground for your next artistic adventure."
scorpio,2015-05-24,"Someone may ask you to participate in a community event or to become involved with a cause that helps others. However, you might not be willing to move in that direction today if your schedule is already too busy. A clash of intentions could produce a temporary standoff, but the disagreement won't likely turn into a major battle. Ultimately, the choice is yours; your smartest strategy may be to ignore the pressure and just ride out the storm. Charitable acts mean so much more when they come from your heart."
sagittarius,2015-05-24,"Your over-the-top optimism could hijack your day if you actually believe that anything is possible. Fortunately, you can have an inspirational impact on others, but you may lose your effectiveness if you are unrealistically enthusiastic. You feel extremely adventurous and lean toward taking a risk, especially if it involves an impulsive attraction. However, try not to confuse anyone with that twinkle in your eyes unless you know exactly what you're getting into today. Once you are honest about your intentions, the sky is the limit."
capricorn,2015-05-24,"The events of the day may turn out to be a lot more complicated than you expected. Someone might try to change your course by pulling strings but you will likely see through the veiled attempts to control the situation. You're not amused by any hidden manipulations; you prefer to bring everything out into the open where reality is more manageable. Nevertheless, the gulf between your subjective world and the external circumstances presents a paradox. Fortunately, you don't have to solve this surprising mystery to find true happiness now."
aquarius,2015-05-24,"A friend or relative might have an unexpected outburst today that triggers your discomfort. The tension is exacerbated by the fact that you often grow anxious when you step out of the logical realms and into the irrational world of feelings. However, you can actually learn from your own illogical reactions, even if you aren't sure where they will lead. Don't blame anyone else for your emotional struggles. The source of your uneasiness comes from within now, so you need to face these fears once and for all and then let them go."
pisces,2015-05-24,"Your top priority now is to hold onto your center of gravity so you don't float off into your dreamworld for the next couple of days. Thankfully, nothing needs to stop you from indulging in your fantasies while you continue to perform your mundane chores. Even if you wish you were doing something more creative, maintain the appearance of your normal routine. You are free to dip into unseen spiritual dimensions when no one is looking as long as your outward productivity doesn't suffer."
aries,2015-05-25,"You may easily upset others today if you are completely honest with them about what you want. You might even justify your position with the facts, but speaking with authority doesn't make your words true, especially while aggressive Mars squares deceptive Neptune. Insisting that you are right isn't a viable strategy because you sound foolish if you pretend that you are an expert on something you're not. Rather than bending reality in your favor, downplay your needs by saying less and listening more."
taurus,2015-05-25,"You could talk up a storm today, acting as if your fantasies are actually based in reality. However, you're not as pragmatic as you seem while your key planet Venus squares wild Uranus, making unusual experiences more enticing than familiar ones. Even if your goals are attainable now, you still might misjudge the resources needed to reach your destination. Your imagination will lead you astray if you let it, but potential rewards are worth the risk. Just don't go too far out on a limb before you know how much weight it can actually support."
gemini,2015-05-25,"People wonder how you can get away with expressing yourself as boldly as you do today. Meanwhile, you're thrilled because it seems like your most colorful dreams are ripe for harvest. However, you might mistakenly believe that your radical tastes are simply too weird to share with those around you. You may suddenly realize how much you aren't saying for fear of being judged because of your eclectic desires. Ultimately, reigning in your rebellious attitude just enough to slip under the radar makes more sense now than blowing your own horn."
cancer,2015-05-25,"You might not receive the clarity you seek today no matter how hard you try to find it. Unfortunately, you won't likely surrender your search before turning into your own worst enemy in the process. You can't help but think what it would be like if everything was new and different now, but it's not. Even if you desire more excitement in your routine, you're not ready to sacrifice your long-term security to live on the edge. Instead of making any drastic changes, continue to wander around in your imagination while still exploring your options."
leo,2015-05-25,"The bottom line is you want more adventure in your life and you're willing to say yes if the right invitation comes along. Even if you have a viable plan to realize your dreams now, you might be tempted to discard it suddenly for a new pursuit. Happily, people seem to support your current decisions but they miss the mark when trying to understand what you really want. You may feel quite restless but it's not yet time to make a break for the future. Maintain the status quo the best you can while preparing to make your big move. Success doesn't happen overnight."
virgo,2015-05-25,"Hiding your emotions isn't a sensible choice today, thus making it impossible to go along with the group consensus. You may resist the flow because you're uncertain of what will happen next, especially if you feel others are conspiring to prevent you from reaching your dreams. Your best move is to avoid being overly attached to your desires now because your fears are strengthened when you worry about things you can't control. Taking care of your current needs is what matters more than anything else."
libra,2015-05-25,"You're stuck in the middle of conflicting strategies now, and you cannot possibly take both paths. Even if you feel like time has run out, you're not ready to close the door to one opportunity in favor of another one. Normally, exercising flexibility brings you strength, but your current inability to make a decision can be unsettling. No matter how ambivalent you are, just choose a path and move forward without looking back. Any action today is better than none at all."
scorpio,2015-05-25,"Although you are known for sticking to your principles, you still might be tempted to take the easy way out today. Your desires are swinging back and forth now, making them more difficult to defend. Additionally, words don't necessarily come easily if you try to explain your position to those who may not support your dreams. Ultimately, your inner process isn't anyone else's business; sharing your secrets is totally optional and should only be done to further your cause."
sagittarius,2015-05-25,"You are forever the optimist and usually don't see anything wrong with asking for what you want. However, life is complicated these days because your desires are drawing you far outside the social norm and you're afraid people won't understand your unorthodox needs. Your imagination is running wild today, challenging you to combine your fantasies with reality. Fortunately, expressing your emotions may be the catalyst to start the alchemical reaction that propels you to your destination of choice."
capricorn,2015-05-25,"Your current situation at work may present you with a fascinating conundrum; however, you don't like riddles that are unsolvable. Your problem is that you may be unexpectedly attracted to the very same kind of uncertainty that you normally avoid. Rather than being drawn to someone because of their apparent stability, you're enchanted by the person with the most eccentric ideas now, even if they have no practical value. However, if you're willing to take a risk, you may discover a priceless treasure."
aquarius,2015-05-25,"It's tricky to turn an innovative idea into something tangible today, even if you receive a blast of creative energy. Unfortunately, you may think you're wasting time trying to accomplish the impossible. However, your emotions are on edge and you're eager to push past any resistance. A sudden fascination stirs feelings that conflict with your logic but don't try to rationalize what's in your heart now. Follow your bliss; the crazier your dreams, the more satisfaction you can achieve."
pisces,2015-05-25,"You reserve the right to march to your own drummer now as you practice a nonconformist strategy. You're not interested in being a part of the team or fitting into complex family dynamics at home while you're driven to distinguish yourself from the crowd. Your courage is inspirational, but people must be free to choose to break the rules in their own unique ways. Nevertheless, don't miss your chance to wildly abandon restraint and dance to the music you hear within."
aries,2015-05-26,"Rushing around just doesn't work today because you may have to go back and do things over again. If you have specific tasks that must be completed, you're probably overeager to finish them as quickly as possible. However, you could get mired down in red tape unless you take each step in the proper order. As boring as it sounds, it's more efficient to follow accepted procedures from the beginning than to bolt ahead without regard for the rules. Haste makes waste."
taurus,2015-05-26,"Finding your creative groove comes naturally today if you limit your activities from the start. Obviously, you want to have something tangible to show for your efforts, but you might sabotage your good intentions by jumping from one idea to another. The more definitive you can be when describing your goal, the less trouble you will have when executing your plan. Don't try to build an entire house now; instead, narrow your vision and eliminate extraneous activities for the best results."
gemini,2015-05-26,"You may resist the restrictions being placed on you now, but they are for your own good. Three planets traveling through rambling Gemini encourage you to spread your energy between family and professional matters. However, you can't do an acceptable job if you need to be two places at once. Thankfully, the laser-like Virgo Moon forces you to tighten your focus. Be grateful for the cosmic reminder; concentrating your efforts now leads to enjoying a wider palette of possibilities later on."
cancer,2015-05-26,"People might commend your high level of efficiency today, but you don't necessarily believe you deserve the compliment. Whether you're holding on to residual emotions from yesterday's craziness or playing out noisy scenarios in your mind, you feel more scattered now than anyone realizes. It helps to acknowledge the gulf between your subjective and objective worlds without making it an issue for others. Fortunately, your inner life won't get in the way of your progress unless you choose to make it a problem. Work now, worry later."
leo,2015-05-26,"You bring a whole new level of awareness to your work today and it can inspire you to perform your job more effectively. Instead of just going through the motions while doing a task, you're considering more economical ways to be productive. It doesn't matter whether or not your analysis pays off with a new method of doing your job. What's important is your improved attitude which positively influences everything you do. Your single-minded approach will generate results you cannot yet imagine."
virgo,2015-05-26,"Maintaining high standards at work is what you do best, but sometimes your drive for perfection gets in the way of your production. However, your conscientious outlook is apparent in everything you undertake now, enabling you to accomplish more than anyone expects. Fortunately, you can draw energy from a deep well of reserve today as long as you don't wander from your task. Aim high, keep your eyes on the target and your shoulder to the wheel."
libra,2015-05-26,"You may not appear any different from the outside today, but something significant has changed and you know it. Although you might feel weary from being bounced around by strong emotional currents, you aren't willing to just drift along with the flow. Go inward and find your center of gravity because you have the power of perseverance on your side now. Establish priorities based on your long-term goals and don't let anyone talk you out of your plans. Be like the little engine that made it up the mountain by repeating, ""I think I can, I think I can."""
scorpio,2015-05-26,"Your dreams are so pragmatic today that it's hard to distinguish them from a business plan. Fortunately, you are so perceptive now that your logical analysis won't lead you astray. But it's smarter to rework a previous idea than come up with new ones while retrograde Mercury is revisiting old territory. Thankfully, you won't reach a wrong conclusion if you start out with solid facts. Your associates offer good advice that augments your strategy, but their thoughts may not be any better than yours. Rely on your inner compass to lead you in the right direction."
sagittarius,2015-05-26,"There are several alternative paths in front of you now, but one probably stands out as the most direct route for reaching your professional goals. However, it seems as if everyone has a different plan for your future, but listening to others as they expound on their ideas is only helpful for a while. Knowing when to excuse yourself from the conversation is crucial, for your answer will come from within only after the external noise settles down. Ultimately, no one can decide your next step but you."
capricorn,2015-05-26,"It's tempting to take on so many tasks today that you can't do a masterful job on any one of them. Several planets buzzing around in fragmented Gemini are activating your 6th House of Routine, thwarting your efforts to zero in on any single objective. Nevertheless, you must overcome your current inclination to scatter your energy willy-nilly. Set your sights on one exciting destination and let all others temporarily fall away from your view. Cultivate a laser-like approach to your work, for success will be yours if you can maintain your focus."
aquarius,2015-05-26,"Your intuition won't let you down today, but you must listen to your inner voice for it to be of value. Unfortunately, setting aside the facts isn't your usual style, but a hunch that comes from out of the blue could defy common sense. Remember, the most ingenious thinking isn't necessarily linear, especially as the rational Virgo Moon connects with shadowy Pluto in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. The truth doesn't arrive in a straight line, so trust the process and follow the zigs and zags for the most surprising results."
pisces,2015-05-26,"Although you might like to dream your way to success, the Virgo Moon keeps you on a straight and narrow path today. Even if you want to escape, there's little opportunity to fade into the fuzziness of your imagination now. Your coworkers want you to succeed because they also benefit from your accomplishments. Collaboration currently works in your favor; being part of the team is easier when you are interacting with people you trust."
aries,2015-05-27,"You may solve a problem at work through sheer  willpower, enabling you to turn a sticky situation to your advantage. However, you also realize your small victory is part of a larger issue for which there's no fast and easy fix. Meanwhile, criticism about your productivity shifts from logistical concerns, opening the door to an ideological power struggle. Your wisest strategy now is non-engagement because once a conflict is underway, you lose even if you win. Make peace, not war."
taurus,2015-05-27,"There's no need to make a quick decision about an ongoing project today because the more time spent in the revision process, the deeper you can go in reassessing your resources. And although you have something practical to learn now, it's still tempting to take the easy way out in order to end an unpleasant conflict. Think long and hard about your current choices, for the consequences of your actions will likely be longer lasting than you realize. Your integrity counts more than anything else."
gemini,2015-05-27,"You've had more than your fair share of doing exactly what others expect from you. You are eager for more fun and games in your life, even if you have important obligations to meet today. Luckily, you will be quite productive if you buckle down and concentrate on your work. You can't help but feel wonderful when you have something tangible to show for your efforts. Take care of business right off the bat so you have the time to run off in search of your favorite distractions later in the day."
cancer,2015-05-27,"Simmering relationship tension raises uncomfortable issues today, even if everything appears copacetic on the surface. Although you may do your best to avoid confrontation, you can't help but notice there's a showdown brewing. Your gut tells you to retreat, yet you could be cajoled into reacting emotionally if you're unsure of where the current changes will lead. Nevertheless, don't over-inflate the importance of the present moment. Instead, look at this interaction as  one part of a long-term positive shift in the overall pattern of your life."
leo,2015-05-27,"The rapid pace of events makes you believe that your schedule is out of control today, but it's not too chaotic for you to effectively manage your affairs. However, you might feel overwhelmed later in the day, especially if you're already thinking of everything you must do tomorrow. Don't get stressed out over how much you have to finish. Thankfully, your worries are worse than the reality; starting with a can-do attitude makes your work more pleasant right from the start."
virgo,2015-05-27,"You are doing your best to keep the lid on your emotions, but you might have a minor meltdown today, revealing your doubts about your ability to handle your current workload. However, the pendulum is swinging the other way now as you find the time to catch up or even get ahead. Setting priorities is crucial, for it's important to know when to let go and move on to what's next. Your confidence will return when you are able to make noticeable progress toward achieving your goals."
libra,2015-05-27,"Just because you're not talking about your feelings today doesn't mean they are non-existent. But, your silence won't necessarily improve your chances of reaching your goals, either. Although your thoughts may be flying all over the place, it's still hard to turn any of them into concrete reality now. This doesn't mean they are bad ideas; it simply indicates that your timing might be off if you push too hard. Your optimism returns later in the day and you should be able to move forward again, as long as you don't try to make up for lost ground."
scorpio,2015-05-27,"Your self-criticism continues to grow lighter day by day. In fact, you might even take a tentative step and acknowledge that you did a great job, even if it didn't turn out exactly as expected. Happily, you are in touch with a more nurturing side of yourself now. But you can do even more good by expressing your feelings outwardly, so shower your unrelenting support on those you love. Your positive energy ripples outward in unimaginable ways, returning joy to you in the process."
sagittarius,2015-05-27,"You can experiment with letting down your guard today, even if you recently had to hold a position of authority longer than you wanted. If your command was successful, you will be able to relax and allow events at work to run their course. But even if your reign hasn't produced your desired results, it's still a good idea to back off and let someone else take charge. Knowing when to relinquish power is the sign of a confident leader. You don't have to be the star of the show to share in the success."
capricorn,2015-05-27,"You might be so intent on reaching the top of the mountain that you could trip and fall if you don't watch where your feet are going today. You must turn your vision into something concrete, but this can be tricky business if your mind is wandering so far off into the future that you're no longer interested in engaging in the present moment. There's nothing wrong with daydreaming when your work is done, but you could end up in trouble now unless you keep your focus on what's right in front of you every step of the way."
aquarius,2015-05-27,"Complications keep popping up now no matter how hard you try to get your schedule under control. It's not that you long for simplicity; in fact, you enjoy the creative buzz when there's a lot happening around you, as long as you can figure out where you fit into the picture. Luckily, your path becomes more obvious as the day wears on. There's no time like the present to embark on an adventure that sets you on the road to your destiny."
pisces,2015-05-27,"You can usually rely on your intuition to steer you in the right direction, but something is slightly off center today, challenging you to make healthy choices. Unfortunately, your self-confidence may suffer when you realize your tried-and-true approach to problem solving just isn't working right now. You can't close your eyes, assuming the Force will guide you safely to your destination. Recognizing your predicament enables you to trust your logic over your imagination when it matters most. Let the facts speak for themselves."
aries,2015-05-28,"If a recent disagreement with a friend or lover created feelings of distrust, you have an opportunity to heal the rift today. Unfortunately, you could be accused of being negative if you attempt to address an uncomfortable subject. Thankfully, there's no need for complete resolution now; speak your mind and then move on. Your calm and rational approach demonstrates your willingness to compromise. Communication is a two-way street, but taking the high road inspires others to do the same."
taurus,2015-05-28,"You won't get the immediate results you seek today, but you're likely to rationalize your behavior, nonetheless. However, if you stretch your thinking a bit, you can discover new ways to handle a recurring problem at work. Stepping back and re-prioritizing your responsibilities is a worthy use of your time but you're more comfortable keeping things the way they are now. However, reconsidering your overall strategy allows you to break through your resistance and plan for the future with a hopeful heart."
gemini,2015-05-28,"You're probably feeling slightly lackadaisical about making significant headway on a big project today. The evocative Moon in your 5th House of Spontaneity is busy hooking up with all the planets in happy-go-lucky Gemini, blessing you with an effervescent outlook on life. Enjoy the lighthearted energy now, since your playful approach to the day might surprisingly provide a generous boost in your productivity. Your childlike curiosity knows no bounds."
cancer,2015-05-28,"You might try to keep your thoughts to yourself today, but somehow they escape from your lips anyway. However, it's critical to carefully consider your message because your words pack more power these days than you realize. Fortunately, your clever mental agility combined with a strong conviction in your beliefs is an unbeatable recipe for success. You can persuade others to see things from your point of view now, as long as your heart is invested in what you say. Decide what matters most and then get busy asking for the support you need to make your dreams come true."
leo,2015-05-28,"These are cosmically auspicious times that can bring you closer to your goals if you're willing to stand up and walk your talk. Words seem to flow off your tongue smoothly when you tell people about your ideas for the future. But idle chatter becomes an endless distraction today, making it especially important to galvanize your thoughts into actions before your momentum fades. Accomplishing nearly anything you set your mind to is possible now if your behavior is aligned with your passion."
virgo,2015-05-28,"Taking care of the simplest tasks today may be more complicated than it appears at first. Thankfully, the Moon's current visit to your 2nd House of Resources supports your efforts to make the most of everything you do. Nevertheless, dig beneath the surface for missing pieces of information that might have significant consequences before signing an agreement or handing over any cash. If you are clear with your intentions and precise with your words, you will cross the finish line with flying colors."
libra,2015-05-28,"You have a plethora of ingenious ideas that all seem worth pursuing today, but you can't turn every flash of inspiration into dramatic action. Rather than attempting to be a superhero, simply write down your most innovative thoughts. Even the most amazing epiphanies could quickly fade back into the hidden depths of your unconscious if you don't fill in all the details. Create a masterful plan now but wait to put it into motion until the timing feels right."
scorpio,2015-05-28,"You may be able to clear up a lingering problem today, even if it's been bothering you for a while. Nevertheless, you could inadvertently mix up your facts as trickster Mercury plays a wild card while retrograding through your 8th House of Transformation. Although you aren't normally inclined toward sloppy thinking, you are so focused on getting the right answers now that you could stumble in the process. Watch your step; success is within reach as long as you pay careful attention to the thin line between truth and illusion."
sagittarius,2015-05-28,"Unresolved issues could sneak in amidst friendly gestures today as the diplomatic Libra Moon sashays through your 11th House of Groups, encouraging you to act graciously. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to tell if a topic is significant enough to address now or if it's only a temporary frustration. Thankfully, you can get away with taking the course of least resistance for a while, leaving the heavy lifting for some other day. Playing nicely with others cultivates a harmonious environment and a better night's sleep."
capricorn,2015-05-28,"You may be busily chasing your tail today without accomplishing very much at all. You might even revisit the very same pitfalls over and over again in your race to finish your work. Fortunately, you're able to shake up the dynamics by discussing your concerns with a trusted colleague. Participating in an honest dialogue about your objectives allows others to offer you valuable support, helping you to break out of the vicious cycle. Gaining objectivity serves you well if you truly want to create positive change."
aquarius,2015-05-28,"Your ability to conjure up the future of your choice is greatly heightened by the reflective Moon's presence in your 9th House of Adventure. Oddly enough, your current optimism encourages others to seek out your approval for their own dreams. Although you are pleased people are asking for your opinion, you're not sure why anyone thinks you know enough to give them advice now. Save the self-questioning for some other day and help out however you can. Just make sure to leave enough time to manifest your own exciting plans while the magic of the cosmos is at your fingertips."
pisces,2015-05-28,"You might think you're being completely rational today but your feelings are actually running the show. Ironically, you could use fancy rhetoric to demonstrate your analytical skills, only to become so emotionally charged that your message loses its impact. If you feel secure within the context of your own life, you don't have to share your process with everyone else. Mercury's retrograde dance in your 4th House of Security makes it tricky to say what's on your mind. Actions speak louder than words; the more generous and kind you are with others, the better it will be for everyone involved."
aries,2015-05-29,"You're on the edge of your seat, anxious to embark on your next adventure. However, relationships demand your attention while the reflective Libra Moon floats through your 7th House of Partnerships. Whether your interactions with others are difficult or comforting today, you may find yourself reconnecting with people from your past and returning to familiar conversations. Luckily, you might even uncover a long-lost memory that will come in handy in the future. Keep an open mind and a receptive heart for the best results."
taurus,2015-05-29,"Your loyalty is tested as coworkers waver on their promises, but don't let anyone's lack of commitment throw you off course. Mercury's current reversal prompts everyone to rethink priorities and reevaluate previous decisions. You don't have to let the uncertainty rattle your foundation. Stay grounded in simple activities that bring you pleasure. Work in your garden, walk your dog or dance to your favorite music. Save your concerns for now: there's no need to worry about things that probably won't happen anyway."
gemini,2015-05-29,"Your overactive imagination acts as both a blessing and a curse today. The world sparkles a little brighter but nothing is exactly as it seems while mischievous Mercury retrogrades into a square with surreal Neptune. Give yourself plenty of breathing room to sort out your options. Although people are unusually unpredictable now, it's best not to sweat the small stuff since surprises keep your life interesting. Use all the colors in the crayon box, but don't sign on any dotted lines."
cancer,2015-05-29,"Keeping your relationships and work life in balance requires a great deal of emotional energy. You may be feeling overwhelmed now as you attempt to stay on top of the most pressing matters and try to please everyone who demands your attention. Thankfully, your living space provides a natural refuge and place of comfort as the reflective Moon shines in your 4th House of Home and Family. Retreat from the busy world as soon as possible and indulge in some good old-fashioned rest and relaxation. The person you need to take care of most today is you."
leo,2015-05-29,"Recent turbulent circumstances with family members and friends have taught you how to open your heart and adapt more gracefully to life's curve balls. Today's artistic Libra Moon highlights your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, bringing creative ideas and fascinating people into your world. You heart-centered Leos know how to show up for those in need when it counts; now it's time to enjoy the love that others want to shower on you."
virgo,2015-05-29,"Your finely-tuned analytical mind has been working overtime since cerebral Mercury turned retrograde last week. Although your employment situation remains stressful and family obligations occupy most of your personal time, powerful cosmic forces are conspiring to help you now. Just when you think you can't fill your brain with one more detail, much-needed support arrives in an unexpected package. It doesn't really matter if it's from a boss, a friend or a stranger. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth; just open the door and let it in."
libra,2015-05-29,"People have been so unpredictable lately that they may be getting on your nerves. Luckily, you have the skills of a natural diplomat and intuitively know how to smooth their feathers. Your charm can coax them back into their more agreeable and likable selves. This talent for turning difficult situations into good ones pays off now as your friendship and loyalty are rewarded. Count your blessings today and find a way to celebrate."
scorpio,2015-05-29,"Not everything is at it appears while the evocative Moon travels through your 12th House of Secrets and Mysteries. However, you are wise to resist going into detective-mode today to figure out what people are thinking or hiding; instead tune into a big-picture view of your life. Is it time to let go of troublesome people? Are you ready to ditch old unproductive habits? Quiet your mind now and turn inward for the answers to the most insistent questions. The busy world of complications can wait."
sagittarius,2015-05-29,"If your natural optimism has been dinged due to recent life changes, you could use a break to reclaim your center. If responsibilities are weighing you down, the Moon's presence in your 11th House of Groups lightens your load with supportive friends, fun events and networking opportunities. It's time to circulate, so accept the invitation you were wondering about. Delegate a few tasks to others if you can and embrace the love and goodwill coming your way."
capricorn,2015-05-29,"Like a butterfly emerging from a chrysalis, your life has been in an ongoing process of transformation. You have seen more than your fair share of difficulties and have had obstacles to overcome. It hasn't necessarily been easy, but you are gaining a foothold and now your hard work is beginning to pay off. Stay focused, even if conflicting information battles for your attention today. Handle each situation with grace; fortunately, no one knows how to take care of business better than you."
aquarius,2015-05-29,"You have so many choices in front of you now that it may be challenging to decide what you want to do next. While nothing needs to be permanently settled yet, consider getting out of your familiar environment and exploring someplace new and different. Your world is opening up in exciting and wonderful ways as the Libra Moon lights up your 9th House of Adventure. Keep your options open today, for you will soon receive information that will help you make excellent long-term decisions. Patience isn't merely a virtue; it's required."
pisces,2015-05-29,"At your best, you are psychically attuned to the vibes, thoughts and emotions of others. Ordinarily, these extrasensory talents help you make your best decisions. But with Mercury moving backward through changeable Gemini, it seems as if people barely know what they are thinking themselves and you're likely to tune into a tangled mess of contradictions. Do yourself a favor and retract your antennae, for luckily nothing needs to be nailed down today. Persistent problems will be easier to solve once you have more clarity."
aries,2015-05-30,"Your plans begin to fall in place today as you gather more information about your partner's vision of the future. However, you need more time to find common ground since you still have important details to work out. Unfortunately, you can't apply everything you discover now, so store what you learn for later when you can use it. Don't act prematurely; listen, observe, and deepen your perspective as much as possible while reevaluating the relationship dynamics. No hurry; no worry."
taurus,2015-05-30,"You might have big expenses on the horizon that require you to spend more than you planned. Naturally, you Bulls like to feel secure about your monetary situation but lingering concerns may be plaguing you now. The incisive Scorpio Moon's shift into your 7th House of Others brings someone into your life who can help you make wise financial decisions. Starting the process of analysis is prudent, especially if you're nervous about the long-term picture. Your first order of business is taking a knowledgeable ally's advice to heart."
gemini,2015-05-30,"You are at a fork in the road and may feel pressured by someone to choose one path or the other. However, this urgency is a bit of an illusion now, so continue incorporating new data and reconsidering your strategy for a while longer. However, be certain your words convey exactly what you mean since you could come across as a know-it-all rather than as a thoughtful person. You will make the best impression on others if you keep your feelings to yourself until you're more certain about your plans. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise: you are truly the master of your own destiny."
cancer,2015-05-30,"One cycle in your life is coming to a close and another is about to begin. However, you can't start your next adventure until you tie up the loose ends from the previous one. Review your recent experiences so you can decide what you want to carry with you into the future. You have an opportunity to express what's in your heart today; however, reflect on your long-term goals before you say anything because your words set your intentions for what's to come. Speaking your truth is essential for the manifestation of your dreams."
leo,2015-05-30,"Your confident nature usually empowers you to navigate your way through the most trying situations. It's not that you have all the answers; you just have a knack of turning mountains into mole hills once you state your intentions. However, you may want assistance now that interactive Mercury aligns with the Sun in your 11th House of Networking. Unfortunately, your tendency to roar rather than whimper misleads people into thinking you're doing fine on your own. Admitting your limitations is the first step to success. Your best friends will happily ride to your rescue if you simply set your pride aside and ask them."
virgo,2015-05-30,"You have a plethora of possibilities to ponder now that the Sun and Mercury are in cahoots traveling through your 10th House of Public Life. But don't get tricked into thinking you must map out your entire future today, since you're likely to change your mind more than once. Instead of stressing out about your ambivalence, luxuriate in the additional time at your disposal to search for answers. Current delays are actually a blessing in disguise since they give you the necessary breathing room to explore all the alternatives you previously never imagined."
libra,2015-05-30,"Money matters are on your mind today as the provocative Scorpio Moon slips into your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Perhaps someone owes you money or maybe you need to discuss the details of a financial arrangement with an expert you trust. Either way, you can solidify your future by thoroughly reviewing your current economic picture and making much-needed minor modifications. Knowing exactly what's happening in the present moment enables you to tweak your plans for the best results."
scorpio,2015-05-30,"Although you might not typically wear your emotions on your sleeve, your feelings are transparent to anyone who takes a second look today. Unfortunately, you're not currently in the mood to involve others in your emotional process, prompting you to deny that anything is wrong. But just because you're fully capable of handling your problems by yourself, it doesn't mean you should. Ultimately, opening your heart is a lot easier than pretending that you're fine if you're not. Sharing your truth reduces your angst and improves the overall interpersonal dynamics."
sagittarius,2015-05-30,"Your life would be much simpler now if everyone around you would stop changing their minds. It seems as if others are telling you what they want one minute, and then saying something completely different the next. However, they would probably remain consistent if they actually knew what they wanted today. Luckily, you don't let fickle people get under your skin. Circumstances are in flux, so don't rely on anyone else for your answers; instead, striving to be your best self inspires those around you to do the same."
capricorn,2015-05-30,"Your schedule has been unusually erratic with mischievous Mercury backtracking in your 6th House of Routine. You may be wondering when your daily life will calm down and return to normal. It's not that you can't handle whatever surprises come your way, but even you even-keeled Goats can grow irritated if people shirk their duties today. Avoid assuming responsibilities that aren't yours; let others take care of their personal problems without your unnecessary interference. Don't waste time trying to change things you can't control when you have your own life to lead."
aquarius,2015-05-30,"You may have plenty of projects in process now and even a few new prospects on the horizon. But you can't say yes to every intriguing opportunity that knocks on your door today as clever Mercury, ardent Mars and the brilliant Sun cluster in your 5th House of Creativity. Fortunately, you can make substantial progress if you tap into the cosmic energy without being pulled every which way. Don't buy into someone else's agenda; for now, remain open-minded without making any promises you can't keep."
pisces,2015-05-30,"Sorting out the most practical thoughts from all the noise is tricky while chatty Mercury connects with the Sun. It's even more complicated today because everyone seems to have something contrary to say. Nevertheless, you can still glean good advice if you carefully filter the opinions from the facts. Thankfully, you'll gain clarity over the days ahead, enabling you to have a better handle on what people want. For now, continue to evaluate the pros and cons of each alternative idea. Although this is a turning point in your planning process, there are still a few revisions yet to follow. Remaining flexible is your ticket to success."
aries,2015-05-31,"You might think you know exactly what you want only to change your mind several times today. Alternating overconfidence and self-doubt can lead you in circles unless you consciously step back from your involvement. Disengaging from an exhausting cycle brings a fresh perspective along with better choices. Just remember that you still have another couple of weeks until your path begins to clear. In the meantime, freely explore your dreams without feeling any undue pressure to make them real."
taurus,2015-05-31,"Maintaining an open mind about what's essential can help you make the most of this confusing day. Several planets are moving through versatile Gemini now, distracting you from your normal routine. Meanwhile, your inner world is a rich source of inspiration as long as you have the courage to entertain the possibilities, even if they are not very practical. Fortunately, you don't have to act on your fantasies, but you gain valuable insight from seriously considering them, nonetheless."
gemini,2015-05-31,"You may believe that you can avoid making a commitment today as long as you stay in motion. Although you want everyone to see how busy you are, this tactic only keeps you from the important tasks you must attend to now. Even if your overall priorities aren't clear, just pick a path and follow it as far as you can. Progress might not be readily discernible for several more days, but completing a project will ultimately be its own sweet reward."
cancer,2015-05-31,"Your dreams lift you to new heights today, but they can also create unneeded complications if you assume they are real. Although you yearn to be accepted for who you are, vulnerable Venus is moving through your receptive sign, making it harder to get your emotions out into the open. Expressing your feelings temporarily exacerbates matters even more, but it may be required if you want to eventually untangle your desires from what's actually possible. You won't know until you take a risk and share what's in your heart."
leo,2015-05-31,"You Lions are known for creating a plan and boldly putting it into action. Your positivity is legendary, but overconfidence is your greatest nemesis. If you come on too strongly today, others might endorse your idea even if it's not a very good one. Your best bet now is to reveal your vulnerability; sharing your uncertainty gives your trusted allies a chance to offer their much-needed expertise. You can develop a winning strategy if you're willing to let go of your expectations and join in the group process."
virgo,2015-05-31,"People often rely on you for the unvarnished truth, whether or not they ultimately like what you have to say. Even if you don't support their ideas, you can be counted on to give some real down-to-earth advice when asked. However, your perspective is warped by your feelings today. You may be overly attached to your assumptions about what others want, instead of finding out the actual facts. Don't just believe your perception of reality is correct; there are other points of view to be considered if you want to see the full picture in its true light."
libra,2015-05-31,"You're resistant to people's advice today because everyone seems to assume they know more about your future prospects than you do. However, you're not interested in hearing their solutions while you're still trying to find your own bearings. Trust your intuition if you think that your friends are barking up the wrong tree now. Nevertheless, it won't hurt to listen to what they have to say as a sign of respect. Be patient; you will find a solution to your current dilemma over the days ahead as long as you keep hope alive and continue to pursue your dreams."
scorpio,2015-05-31,"You desperately want to believe that there is one course of action that makes the most sense for you to follow now. However, the Moon's current visit to your sign prevents you from locking in on a specific goal. You're intrigued by all the possibilities, but there's too many to process and picking one is a daunting task. Fortunately, you don't have to make any commitments today. The most practical choice will grow more apparent over the days ahead. In the meantime, keep your heart and mind open while exploring the various options calling out to you."
sagittarius,2015-05-31,"It's tempting to retreat from your responsibilities and spend time lost in your dreams. Thankfully, you might be able to schedule a revitalizing escape today, but family and friends might not let you disappear for too long. The Sun's square to imaginative Neptune in your 4th House of Foundations enables you to journey inward within the safety of your own home or the emotional security of a stable relationship. Nevertheless, don't fall victim to believing there's a real pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Enjoy the fantasy while it lasts but return your attention to a realistic goal before continuing on your way."
capricorn,2015-05-31,"You have very strong convictions about your future now that the passionate Scorpio Moon is occupying your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. However, you stand to gain even more ground if you can widen your perspective and dream about your life without letting reality hold you back. Discussing your thoughts with close friends is productive as long as you aren't too specific with the details of your plans. Remember, your fantasies don't need to be practical today; letting your imagination take over is more inspiring than following a tried-and-true recipe for success."
aquarius,2015-05-31,"You are a font of fantastic ideas now, but they may not be ready for a prime time audience just yet. Your brain is buzzing with contradictions, but confusion is only problematic if you believe that you must make a final decision today. Although you're tempted to share your conflicting visions of the future with nearly anyone, it's wiser to keep them to yourself for a while longer. However, if you choose to reveal your dreams, don't make it sound like you have exclusive rights on the truth. Communication works best when you listen as much as you speak."
pisces,2015-05-31,"This is a day made for dreaming and, fortunately, you are up for the challenge. The Sun's dynamic square to mystical Neptune in your sign amplifies your penchant for indulging fantasies. Whether you lose yourself in a movie, a book, music or the wonders of nature, it's time to step outside of the real world and follow your creative whims. There are magnificent treasures to be found once you move into the imaginative realms. Taking a walk on the wild metaphysical side of life today rejuvenates your soul."
aries,2015-06-01,"Your irrepressible restlessness could get the best of you today if you grow weary of patiently waiting for the right doors to open. However, it's more important than ever to keep your thoughts from wandering away from your work because things could change very quickly. Focus your full attention on the conversations occurring in the present moment. Your ability to react quickly to new developments now increases your chances for success. Keep your ear to the ground and your eyes wide open so you don't miss a thing."
taurus,2015-06-01,"A coworker may offer their assistance, but you're hesitant to jump to a conclusion and overstep the established boundaries of your current relationship. Asking people for help isn't always comfortable, making it especially tricky to initiate a discussion on a sensitive topic. But don't quit yet; a sudden shift in your attitude allows you to relax and broach the subject with confidence. Expressing your vulnerability might feel like risky business, but meeting someone on neutral ground can produce pleasantly surprising results."
gemini,2015-06-01,"Your self-confidence is high today, inspiring you to make new friends wherever you go. But don't expect to attract companions that fit into your previous expectations as the positive Sagittarius Moon brightens your 7th House of Partnerships. Honor your desire to experience something different by experimenting with innovative ways to interact with someone you want to know better. Remaining open to change demonstrates your ability to play well with others. A light touch and a healthy sense of humor puts everyone at ease."
cancer,2015-06-01,"You're aware that the interpersonal dynamics are changing now even if others can't yet see tangible evidence. You are less encumbered by your need for security and are yearning to break free from old patterns. Although you're cautious about tooting your own horn at first, you can at least take tentative steps on your new journey until you become comfortable talking about your goals. However, you want immediate results and could risk emotional safety for a little excitement. Luckily, there's no reason to wait for a better time; create a plan and work your magic."
leo,2015-06-01,"You can't decide whether you are excited about your future or if you're scared of the upcoming changes. Either way, you can tell that the tide is shifting, even if you don't know which way you want to go. Throwing caution to the wind might be the necessary catalyst that makes your dreams come alive. If you don't take the initiative today, at least imagine what you could accomplish if you set your mind to it. Share your best ideas with a friend; expressing what's in your heart is enough to lift your spirits."
virgo,2015-06-01,"The changes at work keep on coming and you wouldn't mind a bit of respite today in order to process all that's going on. Nevertheless, you want to pursue a few enticing opportunities that are persistently knocking at your door. Balancing your need for emotional security with your desire to take your career to the next level isn't as tough as you think. Proceed with caution and avoid shortcuts at all costs. Manage your resources wisely and you will reach your goals faster than you expect."
libra,2015-06-01,"Your enthusiasm encourages you to start a new project today before you think about what your commitment really means. Unfortunately, even with the best of intentions, you could end up in trouble if you make too many promises too soon. However, it's foolish to begin anything that diffuses your energy now. Take the time to map out your strategy prior to jumping headfirst into your next venture. A methodical approach today guarantees your success in the future."
scorpio,2015-06-01,"You have lots of lofty ideas about the many things you can do today, but you might lack the follow-through to fulfill your fantasies. Fortunately, your problem isn't about missing your mark; instead, your current lesson is to learn how to set sensible goals so you can establish a successful track record. It helps to dream about objectives that are actually within the range of possibility. Applying a practical twist to your most imaginative ideas is the best way to create your plans for the future."
sagittarius,2015-06-01,"It's unusual for you to be so overwhelmed that you can't decide what to do next. Nevertheless, tomorrow's Sagittarius Full Moon stirs up quite a bit of excitement, challenging you to stay cool, calm and collected. You may feel anxious if there are one-too-many appealing options, yet it's still possible to settle down quickly by simply taking a few deep breaths. It's more crucial to maintain your emotional balance now than to seize every exciting opportunity that comes your way. Practicing patience allows you to stay in touch with your center of gravity."
capricorn,2015-06-01,"You may feel like a closet optimist today, especially if you're acting on the premise that you are more successful when your practical nature overshadows your restless ambitions. Unfortunately, this kind of calculated scheming might lead your peers to withhold their trust. Hiding your confidence is not in your best interest even though the extroverted Sagittarius Moon is busy activating your 12th House of Secrets. Let your authentic self shine through, even if you're worried that others won't approve. Humility is an admirable trait, but believing in  your dreams is your secret to success."
aquarius,2015-06-01,"Socializing with your coworkers easily trumps doing your work today, but there's also a very serious side to hanging out with your peers. It may be as innocent as sharing a joke at the water cooler, but the connections you make now can be intrinsically tied to your happiness later on. Don't expend too much energy trying to impress anyone with your brilliance or your charm. Ultimately, it's the sweetest, heart-centered relationships that add the most meaning to your life."
pisces,2015-06-01,"It's perfectly natural for you Fish to dream about your future and wonder where you are going in life. Fortunately, sorting out your long-term goals makes a lot of sense because your far-sighted vision is unobstructed by your emotions now. Reassess all the ways you can build on the solid foundation you have already created, rather than arbitrarily heading off in an entirely new direction. Don't worry about how much you actually accomplish today; real progress will still require some time to manifest. The seeds of personal growth must first be planted in your fertile imagination."
aries,2015-06-02,"You must be ready to shift gears on a moment's notice, since your plans are likely to expand with the Sagittarius Full Moon magnifying your 9th House of Big Ideas. Until now, you believed your own story and knew where you were going, but your world is dramatically changing now. Thankfully, you're up for the challenge as long as you can keep the conversations flowing. Don't try to schedule anything too far in advance since your current success depends upon your spontaneity. The future is contained in the here and now; all you have to do is find it."
taurus,2015-06-02,"You may need to reevaluate your strategy when you discover that your allies aren't as committed to your success as you previously thought. Whether or not you receive support, it's still wise to conserve your resources until you determine how your current actions fit into the larger picture. But don't immediately rush to remedy a potential problem while the Sagittarius Full Moon destabilizes your 8th House of Shared Resources. Be patient; ultimately, you could be in a better position than you think if you don't overreact and push everyone away."
gemini,2015-06-02,"It might seem as if people are being emotionally demanding today as the Sagittarius Full Moon lights up your 7th House of Others. You're forced to reevaluate your relationship options, motivating you to grow in ways that can actually ease the current pressure. Unfortunately, pretending everything is fine only makes matters worse. Take a risk and start a conversation about what you need to feel more secure. Your disclosure could precipitate a disagreement, but sticking with the discussion will ultimately lead to a stronger partnership. No pain, no gain."
cancer,2015-06-02,"Maintaining your boundaries at work can be tricky as the Sagittarius Full Moon floods your 6th House of Routine. Your dreams are so vivid now that they overflow into your waking life, impacting your job and everyone around you. You might be annoyed that your current employment isn't emotionally satisfying or intellectually challenging. Nevertheless, expressing your preferences without misdirecting anger at a coworker could lead to a major breakthrough when it comes to your career. Embrace the future and don't look back."
leo,2015-06-02,"You Lions like to shine your light with the brilliant radiance of the Sun, but now you're encouraged to express your feelings as the Sagittarius Full Moon emphasizes your 5th House of Romance. Sinking further into the emotional lunar realms is essential if you truly want to deepen a friendship or intensify a relationship. Although you might think a rational approach will keep you safe, logic only takes you so far when it comes to love."
virgo,2015-06-02,"You're rather pensive today, but you're still ready to act on a thought that's been running around in your head for a few days. However, you can feel the palpable tension between your spoken words and your unexpressed desires. You might try to separate the rational from the irrational, but the two are hopelessly entangled while the optimistic Sagittarius Full Moon illuminates your 4th House of Roots. Knowing where you want to go is more important now than knowing how to get there. Let go of the logistics and follow your heart."
libra,2015-06-02,"You may be questioning everything you know today, but the current cosmic energy indicates you're probably traveling on the right path. The philosophical Sagittarius Full Moon amplifies your 3rd House of Communication, presenting you with a paradox. It's fruitless to adopt a global perspective now, so return your attention to your immediate environment where you can directly influence the dynamics. You can't solve all the problems in the world, but you certainly can attend to the most practical details that improve your everyday existence."
scorpio,2015-06-02,"You've been sitting on an emotional volcano and you could be tempted to release the tension as today's Sagittarius Full Moon activates your 2nd House of Values. If you feel as if you're ready to explode, it's more prudent to take a deep breath first and reexamine how your basic beliefs are influencing your current frustration. Altering your assumptions about what you need in any relationship can catalyze the dynamics and free you from the past. Your dependence on the approval of others diminishes as your self-esteem grows. There's no time like the present; claim your power now."
sagittarius,2015-06-02,"Your emotions are running amok, forcing you to follow your instincts rather than common sense. Fortunately, today's Full Moon in your sign enables you to experience brilliant flashes of awareness like strikes of lightning in a storm. Don't withdraw from those closest to you just because the situation is uncomfortable. Instead, continue to share your feelings with those you trust most. The best way to cultivate your relationships now is to keep your heart open to surprises."
capricorn,2015-06-02,"Someone may throw you a curve ball as the boisterous Sagittarius Full Moon lands in your 12th House of Privacy. Hidden emotions are brought out into the open today, whether you approve of the disclosure or not. You might believe that keeping up appearances is the best way to handle the current awkwardness. However, staying light on your feet enables you to successfully navigate any unexpected changes. Remember, like the sure-footed Mountain Goat, you can dance on the edge of a cliff without ever losing balance as long as you don't look down."
aquarius,2015-06-02,"Your exhilaration is irrepressible today; you have people to see and places to go while the Sagittarius Full Moon energizes your 11th House of Social Networking. You're eager for a significant change and you could receive clear signals about your future. Everything that occurs now is just one more clue to the puzzle. Nevertheless, you still must connect the dots for the current picture to make sense. Stay fully awake now so you can successfully ride the waves of this current cosmic buzz."
pisces,2015-06-02,"Your ambitions to get ahead could generate exciting electric sparks in a business relationship today as the Sagittarius Full Moon triggers your 10th House of Career. However, your professional objectives seem to be dynamically opposed to the simple pleasures of home and family life. Although peace and quiet may be hard to find now, open and honest discussions are the grist for the mill that ultimately creates the emotional foundation you seek without compromising the pursuit of your dreams."
aries,2015-06-03,"It's important for you to know that your work has meaning as you seek something intangible that goes beyond recognition and acknowledgment today. Nevertheless, you're not prepared to give up the stability that your current job provides. Luckily, there's no reason to add unnecessary stress by making dramatic changes now, even if you are feeling somewhat frustrated in your position. Keep your concerns to yourself for a  while longer; you can make your big move after Mercury turns direct next week. A little patience serves you well."
taurus,2015-06-03,"Your nerves could begin to wear thin if you have been sustaining intense excitement for a prolonged period. Nevertheless, you aren't ready yet to settle down and restore tranquility to your life. Although rest and relaxation usually sounds like a wonderful idea to you peaceful Bulls, you probably won't have much of a chance to kick back today. In the meantime, create small pockets of emotional harmony so you can recharge your batteries little by little throughout the day."
gemini,2015-06-03,"You wish you could take the day off to play, but you might not be able to shake the guilt if others are expecting you to act in a responsible manner. You might camouflage your anxiety with a smile, but you won't likely have the patience to hide your ambivalence about work for long. Nevertheless, your journey to find the truth demands a long-term commitment, so don't expect to have a sudden epiphany today and move on. Thankfully, if you remain sincere about your intentions, the fun times will return sooner than you think."
cancer,2015-06-03,"You won't let anyone talk you out of your point of view today, even if you secretly realize that compromise is a more productive strategy. Your current resistance is prompted by your fear of acquiescing control to someone you don't trust. Thankfully, you grow more receptive to alternative perspectives after the Moon takes up residence in your 7th House of Others this evening. Listening carefully throughout the day helps you find a path that values everyone's unique individuality, including your own."
leo,2015-06-03,"You're quite animated in your self-expression today, but it's challenging to hit the target with your words. It's as if everything you say is slightly out of focus, and trying harder doesn't seem to sharpen your message. Instead of narrowing your perceptions to gain clarity, pretend you're looking at the world through a wide-angle lens. Let the details drop away so you can concentrate on the bigger picture now. Adopting a more philosophical approach enables you to take life less seriously."
virgo,2015-06-03,"People might wish you were more optimistic and outgoing these days, but you're not responsible for anyone else's emotional discomfort. If you are feeling reclusive today, just ask those closest to you to respect your desire to be left alone to your own devices. However, it is wise to keep one foot in reality now, even if the other one wants to escape. Remember, walking the fine line between the inner and outer worlds offers the widest variety of options."
libra,2015-06-03,"You have grand expectations about what you want to accomplish today, but it's difficult to get much of anything done. You are hesitant to say what's on your mind because your ideas are so outrageous now that you think no one will take you seriously. Forget about trying to convince others you are up to something revolutionary; just reveal your plans in a casual manner. Oddly enough, downplaying your brilliant thoughts for another few days strengthens your overall message. Timing is everything."
scorpio,2015-06-03,"You aren't one to avoid conflict when you believe your values are being attacked, prompting you to contemplate what's really worth fighting for today. You may unconsciously create a scenario where you are at odds with others just so you can prove your superiority. Take the high road by consciously choosing compromise over confrontation in order to minimize the negativity. When all else fails, it never hurts to give peace a chance."
sagittarius,2015-06-03,"Monetary concerns, possibly involving a partner who spends more than you do, can put the brakes on an upcoming vacation that's still in the planning stages. But don't make any major changes to your calendar yet, even if you're having second thoughts today. You will quite likely regret it next week if you cancel your trip now. Waiting out the storm makes more sense than turning your whole life upside down in a moment of emotional overload. Hold tight to your dream because your positive attitude can actually help it to manifest."
capricorn,2015-06-03,"You need to honor your feelings today or you could stir up unnecessary drama later this evening when the Moon moves into your goal-oriented sign. Practice quieting your mind so you can hear your inner voice of intuition. Luckily, your psychic sense will steer you in the right direction now, unless you choose to override it with endless calculations of analysis and logic. Don't let your determination to follow your instincts waver; connect with your heart, not with your head."
aquarius,2015-06-03,"Your subconscious may be trying to tell you something you must hear today, but it's a lot less stressful in the moment to just ignore the message. You might overcompensate for your doubts by attempting to convince others of your worth. But pushing too hard to impress everyone only leaves you feeling overextended and exhausted. Creating healthy boundaries is more constructive right from the beginning, especially if you need to say no. Speaking up for yourself earns you more self-respect in the long run."
pisces,2015-06-03,"Making a positive lasting impression on your boss is your main concern today. However, completing your chores in a timely manner won't help you clarify your long-term aspirations. It isn't that you are lost and confused; you simply have too much on your plate and could use an objective point of view as you reset your priorities for the weeks ahead. Surrounding yourself with supportive allies inspires you to believe in yourself."
aries,2015-06-04,"You might believe you are being personally attacked if a coworker confronts you about your work today. However, there's no reason to automatically compromise your position by modifying your views to accommodate others. Although someone else may not share your perspective, don't just pretend to agree in order to keep the peace. Instead, remain firm about your intentions and focused on your goals or you'll ultimately irritate your peers. Mutual understanding and respect is essential for your success."
taurus,2015-06-04,"You could spend a lot of time daydreaming about going somewhere far away, yet you're determined to find a practical use for your wanderlust today. Unfortunately, packing your bags and leaving everything behind doesn't necessarily fit into your present circumstances. However, you might be able to schedule a real vacation in the near future if you are selective about your current choices. Once you decide on a destination, set your mind to make it happen. Imagination first; reality next."
gemini,2015-06-04,"You are tempted to dismiss a very practical proposal today before you even give it any real consideration. Unfortunately, being close-minded is a mistake because an out-of-hand rejection could inadvertently stir up negativity from potential allies. Your willingness to be a sounding board is more important than you realize. Even if you don't like the idea after you hear all the details, others will still know that you care enough to listen. Treating people with the same respect you want for yourself cultivates good feelings all around."
cancer,2015-06-04,"People may be making demands on your time, complicating relationships and agitating your nerves, since the issues now raised can't be quickly dismissed. Emotional stresses are amplified because your instincts tell you to run for the hills today while the situation continues to hold your feet to the fire. Resign yourself to processing your fears instead of avoiding them for the sake of convenience. Believe it or not, sticking with the process enables you to transform lemons into lemon meringue pie."
leo,2015-06-04,"You're in a practical frame of mind today and nothing will deter you from executing your job and finishing your chores as efficiently as possible. You are certainly up for the challenge, even if doing your work presents a high level of difficulty. Although it feels as if you're running out of time, you still might commit to complete a project on schedule. Don't give in to uncertainty if you have a temporary bout with your insecurities along the way. Your doubts will dissipate as you get closer to the finish line and your goals are within reach."
virgo,2015-06-04,"Ironically, you are quite serious about being playful today with the ambitious Capricorn Moon hanging out in your 5th House of Fun and Games. You actually look forward to the hard work and  the satisfaction that you can earn. Maintaining a positive attitude is a piece of cake if your job involves doing something that is exciting and different. But don't worry even if you're feeling bored; just take it one step at a time and do whatever task needs to be done next. Graciously accept any rewards and recognition that come your way with a thank you and a smile."
libra,2015-06-04,"Domestic obligations pull you away from your career responsibilities and back to the home front while the Moon travels through your 4th House of Family. You might be asked to play a parental role on demand today or you could be required to help out your own parents. No matter what, your emotions play a significant role in the relationship dynamics. Keep your priorities straight by acknowledging the special feelings and irreplaceable connections you share with the ones you love."
scorpio,2015-06-04,"A close friend might have an intense story to tell you today, and it's wise to take the time to listen while the calculating Capricorn Moon connects with passionate Pluto, luring you into your 3rd House of Information. There isn't a test for comprehension following this personal disclosure, but you should still do your absolute best to learn what you can from the revelations. But there are no observers; you are part of the process. Opening your heart to receive the message is only half the equation; you must speak your truth in return."
sagittarius,2015-06-04,"Although you're not necessarily the possessive type, you can become overly protective now of an idea that you believe is yours. You feel as if you birthed the thought and it's your right to take it to the next level, but there may be someone else who wants to get in on the act. Instead of resisting the free exchange of information, sharing your thinking process with your peers works in your favor. Being the beneficiary of multiple points of view can push the development process along faster than you could do on your own."
capricorn,2015-06-04,"Your motives are complicated while the Moon hooks up with emotionally intense Pluto in your hardworking sign. Your convictions may be stronger than your logic today, placing you in a vulnerable position. Your feelings are exploding into awareness now, whether you want them to or not. However, once you are conscious of your desires, you might not be so inclined to stuff them back in the box. There's no need to justify what's in your heart if you just let the current energy play out on its own."
aquarius,2015-06-04,"Otherworldly ideas are simmering in your metaphysical stewing pot as the evocative Moon joins transformative Pluto in your 12th House of Spirituality today. Unexpressed emotions continue to churn just beneath the radar of your consciousness. Ironically, it may be wise to let them remain out of sight for a while longer, so you don't have to waste your time defending thoughts and emotions that are still in flux. Don't push the process; the most amazing magic occurs when you trust the timing of the universe."
pisces,2015-06-04,"Your dreams of the distant future are not as far away as they might seem today. Paradoxically, you're viewing your unformed and unknown life in advance through a set of very practical lenses. You won't be misled by any idealistic fantasies now. However, you could be so cautious that you miss an incredible opportunity. Even if you think an idea isn't sensible, you still might want to go ahead and explore it anyhow. In the meantime, simplifying your schedule gives you the room to experiment without any negative repercussions."
aries,2015-06-05,"You may set off for an emotional journey now, even if you don't think you have sufficient time to explore your feelings. Nevertheless, you are ready to grab hold of an opportunity today as assertive Mars receives a boost from auspicious Jupiter. You might even choose to let go of your past to start all over again. Don't hold back while happy-go-lucky Venus is dancing in your 5th House of Spontaneity; explore the pleasures that you seek, even if it's only in your dreams."
taurus,2015-06-05,"It's rather unnerving when you're not in control of your feelings, yet peace of mind grows even more elusive if you add worry into the equation. Your key planet Venus moves into your 4th House of Security today, encouraging you to take a more practical approach in your relationships. Paradoxically, you may be tempted now to shake everything up for the sake of change. But be careful about overreacting and creating more complications. Meet others halfway or you could miss out on the love that's already in your life."
gemini,2015-06-05,"Your social life receives an energetic boost when charming Venus moves into your 3rd House of Communications today. It's a lot more fun to talk about how much you enjoy the company of your friends, rather than exposing your vulnerability with a more intimate emotional interaction. Fortunately, there's no reason to fret over how to best express your feelings when you're with people you trust. Simply let go and flirt with the edge; your heart is happiest when a bit of excitement is added to the mix."
cancer,2015-06-05,"Your perspective on love is about to change, but first you must look back over the past several weeks to reevaluate what the planet of beauty has already brought to your life. Continue to build on what you have now that sweet Venus is moving out of your sign to enter your 2nd House of Resources. Although this is an opportune time to stabilize relationships, you may still be toying with the idea of starting a new one. Breaking free of the structured routine might feel good for a day or two, but don't forget to leave a trail of breadcrumbs so you can find your way back."
leo,2015-06-05,"There's no valid justification to keep your feelings quiet today. But it is crucial to make sure that your current agenda is in your best interest because it's all too tempting to get carried away with your desires now. Watch your step, for you could be more flirtatious than you realize with amorous Venus influencing your 1st House of Self. Remember, all your actions have consequences. In the final analysis, the choice is yours."
virgo,2015-06-05,"You could miss a wonderful chance to express your desires today if you are so afraid of negative consequences that you remain silent. Luckily, all is not lost since there will be new opportunities in the near future. Nevertheless, you increase the likelihood of happiness if you can transform your attachment to personal love into something more spiritual as sensual Venus moves through your soulful 12th House for the next several months. Adopting a grateful heart is a good first place to start."
libra,2015-06-05,"Your self-image may be distorted now; nevertheless, you believe that you have something very personal to hide today. However, revealing your secrets is easier and more enjoyable than you expect. Your key planet Venus is opening your heart in new ways while jovial Jupiter boosts your confidence. It's quite possible to take a feeling too far, but acting in a responsible manner could avert a potential mess later on."
scorpio,2015-06-05,"You're eager to put on a show now that magnetic Venus starts to draw attention to your 10th House of Public Status. However, you aren't sure how much effort you should devote to a current project while you're juggling conflicts between your personal desires and professional obligations. The good news is you may receive recognition from people who only know you only through your work since you're so adept at compartmentalizing your life. Just accept the positive feedback wherever it appears with the appropriate amount of gratitude and humility."
sagittarius,2015-06-05,"Coasting through the day sounds like a marvelous idea, especially if you are working too hard. Nevertheless, your unchecked desires can take you on a detour as it gets tougher to maintain the balance between fantasy and reality. Although your heart and your head are pulling in opposite directions, you don't need to be afraid to share your personal dilemma. In fact, your vulnerability makes you more lovable. There's no need to give up on the idea of fun just because you haven't a clue as to what to do next."
capricorn,2015-06-05,"You may believe your life will fall apart unless you act maturely. Believe it or not, there is a time and a place for letting go of responsibilities, too. Don't be so rational today; instead, indulge your passions for a change. There's no need to judge yourself negatively just because you want to have a good time. You have already done your fair share of the labor so go ahead and release your inner child and explore your imagination. Play now, work later."
aquarius,2015-06-05,"You could fall in love with the idea of love now, whether or not you're in the market for romance. Flirty Venus dances into your 7th House of Relationships to add sparkle to your interactions with nearly everyone. You can also feel the optimistic buzz from giant Jupiter, overpowering your need for stability. Go ahead and explore all the possibilities without choosing any particular one. Following your heart inspires you to make the best choices for your future, but there's no need to complicate a lovely day with too many promises."
pisces,2015-06-05,"There's no magical escape route today, so you might as well buckle in and get busy. Thankfully, congenial Venus makes work more pleasant once she moves into your 6th House of Employment. Nevertheless, you might scheme and dream about breaking free to avoid your obligations to others. However, you could actually enjoy helping someone else now even more than fulfilling your own needs. It does one's heart good to be of service to others."
aries,2015-06-06,"You wish you were free enough to say whatever you want, but you realize that your chances of finding happiness are greater if you keep some things to yourself. You want to be accepted for who you are, yet your brusque manner could rub others the wrong way. Thankfully, you understand that reaching your goals today is more important than how you get there and you're willing to moderate your aggressive approach to appease others. Take everyone's feelings into consideration since the ends don't always justify the means."
taurus,2015-06-06,"You're a formidable opponent today, even if you prefer to steer clear of conflict. Your unwavering patience and single-minded resolve can wear someone down who stands in your way. You gain strength from your ability to avoid arguments, even if there are obvious differences of opinion. Gentle persuasion brings the results you seek without having to raise your voice or push anyone's emotional buttons. Hold your ground and wait for others to come to their senses and agree with your point of view."
gemini,2015-06-06,"You are reluctant to share your feelings now, but your quiet acceptance of a close friend or partner helps to create a more harmonious atmosphere. It's apparent there's nothing to be gained now by effusive rants or frantic melodramas. Enjoy the peaceful energy while it lasts, but remember that it might just be a temporary eye of a hurricane. Don't worry about justifying your goals to anyone today; you are well equipped to share your story as long as you're not in a rush to prove your point. Keep calm and carry on."
cancer,2015-06-06,"Someone might be secretly pulling the strings from behind the scenes to manipulate the current course of events. However, you aren't willing to give up your power now until you try to bend reality in your direction. Interacting with others is challenging if you believe you don't know the whole truth. But rather than wasting time attempting to uncover anyone's hidden agenda, just concentrate on your own positive actions, instead. Happiness is within reach as long as you realize that it comes from within."
leo,2015-06-06,"You have a clear sense of what's possible and what's not. More importantly, your generosity of spirit plays a significant role in achieving your goals today. Your charm is readily apparent while Venus is sparkling in your 1st House of Personality, and her easy trine to karmic Saturn gives you a realistic outlook on life. You can successfully push the edges of the current stability by taking a calculated risk now. Thankfully, decisions about money or love will likely turn out for the best as long as you remember to weigh your options carefully before making your move."
virgo,2015-06-06,"You possess a sharp clarity of mind today that breaks through the fog, allowing you to feel confident about an important choice you must make. You can see your life unfolding and you know what to do to create the future as you envision it. However, it is a mistake to think your current decision is the final one because logical Mercury is still retrograde in your 10th House of Status. Although you have a general idea of what it takes to reach your destination, there are still specifics to be determined. Give yourself some breathing room so you can recalibrate your direction as needed."
libra,2015-06-06,"Managing your relationships may require kid gloves today as you attempt to balance your need to express yourself with your desire to sidestep conflict. You want to be among friends now, but not at the cost of losing some facet of your self-identity. Thankfully, you are a force to be reckoned with now as authoritative Saturn harmonizes with resourceful Venus. Combining kindness with honesty enables you to get the best from both worlds."
scorpio,2015-06-06,"It's apparent to you that a special relationship is more complicated than it seems to everyone else. You know what you need, but you may be hesitant to agitate things in a way that could disturb the status quo. Fortunately, you are blessed with trustworthy friends who may not tell you what you want to hear, but their honest opinions are sound, nonetheless. The current window of opportunity won't last, so don't procrastinate. If you want another perspective, ask before it's too late."
sagittarius,2015-06-06,"Your friends and relatives may grow weary of your avoidance tactics today because it's clear you don't want to be pinned down. Although you prefer to keep your options open, people are pressuring you to tell them your opinion without talking in vague generalities. Don't let your current resistance to making a commitment turn your closest allies into unexpected enemies. Focus on building stability, not upsetting it. Appreciating your loved ones in the present moment allows you to honor your relationships without compromising your ideals."
capricorn,2015-06-06,"Your desire to find pleasure today may not be obvious to everyone else. However, your ruling planet Saturn is basking in the warmth of delicious Venus, encouraging you to share the sweetness of life with those you love. However, your current laid-back attitude doesn't mean you're carefree enough to ignore your responsibilities. Although Venus motivates you to follow your heart now, you still have a difficult time letting go of your obligations. Sign your own permission slip and take the day off."
aquarius,2015-06-06,"You may be quite serious about relationships today as responsible Saturn trines romantic Venus in your 7th House of Others. Nevertheless, you still want to be seen as someone who knows how to have a good time. Your current emotional fulfillment depends on finding a balance. Your best strategy is to inspire your friends to join in your creative pursuits. However, achieving satisfaction is more likely if you don't set your goals too high. Engaging life without any expectations now gives you a wide latitude to experience happiness."
pisces,2015-06-06,"You know more than you are saying today, but no one can get you to spill the beans while the Moon is hiding out in your 12th House of Secrets. Perhaps someone told you something in confidence, or maybe you haven't yet put your developing ideas into words. Either way, your friends appreciate your trustworthiness because they understand that you will divulge what is necessary when the time is right. But don't confuse your current need for privacy with alienation. You can still be close to those you love without sharing everything on your mind."
aries,2015-06-07,"You could spend a lot of time thinking about your future, but might remain stuck in a routine that's tough to break now. Dreaming about what you want your life to look like is much easier today than putting your ideas into motion. Thankfully, there's no urgency to initiate action yet; the time for manifestation will come soon enough. Instead, simply consider the positives and negatives of each option without becoming attached to any single outcome. Reexamining all the angles has you sitting pretty for when you're ready to make your move."
taurus,2015-06-07,"You're excited about your solution to a lingering problem at work, but the situation could turn out to be more complex than you realize. Even if your plan seems solid, it won't necessarily work unless you're willing to modify it on the fly in response to the unfolding events. Don't let a lack of imagination stand between you and success. Rather than trying to defend your initial idea, be appreciative of any feedback you receive and make revisions as needed. A true sign of strength is knowing when to ask for help."
gemini,2015-06-07,"Although others are counting on you to finish your regular chores, you're eager to do something spectacular today. Thankfully, you're clever enough to pull off doing both. Nevertheless, your wagging tongue and cavalier attitude could land you in trouble if you casually say something that people take the wrong way. Remember, you really don't need to have the last word in every conversation. Even if you know you're right, remain silent now for the sake of keeping the peace."
cancer,2015-06-07,"You may think that your friends who should be supporting you are ambivalent or possibly even working against you. However, accusing anyone of foul play could leave you feeling out of sorts today. But a short fuse on anyone's part feeds your insecurities and transform an unintentional mistake into a serious squabble. Luckily, you can change the dynamics by letting everyone know how you feel instead of trying to convince others your position is right. Dropping your defenses and starting an honest dialogue opens a path to common ground."
leo,2015-06-07,"You might grow annoyed when you realize that a current conversation feels hauntingly familiar. In fact, you've probably had this very same discussion before and its reappearance now indicates the issue hasn't been resolved. Unfortunately, it's not likely to be settled today either, so don't push too hard for a quick fix. A mutually acceptable conclusion to this difference of opinion can't be forced; an agreement will come naturally on its own schedule if you can find the patience to trust the process."
virgo,2015-06-07,"You realize what's expected of you today and you're resigned to fulfill your commitments, even if your heart isn't in it. Thankfully, you can keep your doubts to yourself and still go through the necessary motions quite effectively. However, there's a price to pay because the consistent stress will ultimately tire you out. There is no logical reason to wait until exhaustion sets in; take a breather and get the rest you need as soon as there's a break in the action."
libra,2015-06-07,"Although you appear to be the quintessential friend today, you could be hiding your anger out of respect for someone else. Thankfully, you can downplay any negativity now because of the strength of your convictions. The bottom line is you don't want to make waves and draw attention to your feelings; you prefer to offer your objective eye and creative hand to those around you in a gesture of support. The appreciation you are likely to receive will fill your heart with joy."
scorpio,2015-06-07,"You could act in a self-righteous manner if you are certain that you have found the correct answer to a difficult question. Initially, it's just a matter of happily announcing your solution to everyone, but your disclosure might turn ugly if someone disagrees and decides to push back. A conflict may spread like a brush fire now, sparking new hot spots along the way. There are many roads that lead to the same destination; thankfully, the heat will subside when you accept that the wisdom of others is worthy of consideration, too."
sagittarius,2015-06-07,"People might complain about working with you if you are rigid about your schedule today. However, you can't even see how stubborn you are now; in fact, you may actually think your approach is extremely flexible. The simple proof is in how well you get along with your coworkers. If you can sense any hostility, rest assured it will swiftly dissipate if you are more willing to cooperate. Changing your attitude turns an adversarial relationship into a collaborative one without a lot of stress."
capricorn,2015-06-07,"You may wake up convinced that there won't be sufficient time to finish all the work on your plate today. Or, maybe you're concerned that there isn't enough cash on hand to meet your current commitments. But even if your worries are justified now, it's still helpful if you can replace some of your apprehension with a dash of hope and trust. Having faith in your ability to manage all the moving pieces works in your favor as long as you remember to balance it with a touch of reality."
aquarius,2015-06-07,"Your ability to solve complex problems is usually strengthened by your powers of deduction. But even if you have already reexamined your options, your current desires are conflicting with your rational style now. Unfortunately, the evocative Moon's return to your sign doesn't make your life less complicated, since you wish your feelings weren't getting in the way of an already tough predicament. The simple act of honoring your emotions can teach you a valuable lesson you might otherwise miss."
pisces,2015-06-07,"Fitting into family functions or group activities can be awkward today because you don't want everyone to know your true feelings. You might see yourself as an outsider now, but retreating from people will likely bring the attention you wish to avoid. Although confronting your fears is advisable, your current emotional vulnerability could make any situation seem overwhelming. However, rather than taking everything so personally, adopting a more spiritual approach helps you put your life in proper perspective."
aries,2015-06-08,"Your choices are as murky as mud today, yet you're ready to boldly take on the world in spite of the confusion. Allow as much time as possible before making a critical decision because an impulsive judgment call could lead you down a dead-end path, even if you believe you're doing the right thing. It's crucial to figure out the truth first, for faulty assumptions only create tension in your interactions with others. For now, playing out fantasies in your imagination is safer than doing it in the real world."
taurus,2015-06-08,"You might not be able to figure what to do next because of conflicting instructions you receive from your boss. Instead of attempting to gain additional clarity about your professional goals, it's wise to step back now and let the issues resolve on their own. However, there's no reason to hesitate on an important personal decision just because you feel blocked at work. You can still make significant progress on the home front if you're willing to reach a little further and try a little harder for the benefit of those you love."
gemini,2015-06-08,"Although you could have all your facts gathered neatly in place, you still may draw an incorrect conclusion from all the right data. It's as if you set a trap for yourself by taking every thought too far today. It's one thing to know what is true; it's a completely different issue to turn your stacks of information into a successful game plan. Think again before initiating any action you might soon regret. Review your assumptions one last time to make sure you're on the right track."
cancer,2015-06-08,"Your psychic sense seems right on target today and you don't really care about justifying your choices. You are so confident of your intuition now that you trust your feelings without a second thought. Although your hunches may be uncannily correct, it's still challenging to discern a causal relationship between the facts at your disposal and your emotional response to the situation. Stop over-analyzing everything; just follow your heart and hope for the best."
leo,2015-06-08,"You can tell there are emotional dynamics that are beyond your range of experience, but you can't quite put your finger on them. Although you may be relying more on your intuitive accuracy now because it seems to be working better than ever, you would be wise to treat this newly found skill with care. Even if the likelihood of being correct is good, the odds are not perfect. Don't assume you are right until you back up your conclusions with reality. Trust your instincts, but listening to a second opinion never hurts."
virgo,2015-06-08,"You are closing in on a significant personal or professional breakthrough, but you must suspend your disbelief in order to make the leap. Unfortunately, progress will be difficult to come by now if you develop your plans based only upon logical analysis. Instead of sticking to rational thought to find your answers, take a leap of faith into your limitless imagination. Nothing is holding you back from fulfilling your destiny except your fear of the unknown."
libra,2015-06-08,"Often you are blessed in having the Scales of Libra assisting you in weighing and balancing the facts. Although you're usually a champ when it comes to seeing both sides of an issue, your ability to remain objective is probably unreliable today. Your current desire to find an immediate answer throws you off balance, swaying you one way or the other. You might not be certain of what you want but any choice you make now could do more to decide your future than you realize. Reconsidering the alternatives to cover all your bases is surely in your best interest."
scorpio,2015-06-08,"You might have an odd feeling that the fates have something special in store for you today. However, you may have a hard time knowing how to connect with your destiny. Your current uncertainty about your professional goals could muddle your strategy at work. To make matters worse, dreams from the past resurface to confuse your present aspirations with older ambitions. Thankfully, once you give yourself permission to float for a few days, you won't be so frustrated by your lack of commitment. Too much searching often blinds the eye that seeks yet never finds."
sagittarius,2015-06-08,"It's prudent to avoid starting a major project today because you could easily mislead yourself about the amount of resources you will need to complete your work. Your exuberance may morph into discouragement as the reality of the situation begins to dawn on you. Your best bet is to use your time effectively by shifting into planning mode today. Buoyant Jupiter empowers you to see the big picture now, but it's wiser to swing into motion a few days after Mercury turns direct. Waiting for the wind to blow in your direction makes all the difference in the world."
capricorn,2015-06-08,"Your ever-present need for stability could be challenged by a strange and enigmatic situation today. The more you attempt to untangle the complexity of the politics on the job, the more perplexing the dynamics become. You may dream of retreating to safer ground, but even the return path is more complicated than you remember. Relax; once you stop struggling, the answers will come from within."
aquarius,2015-06-08,"Your mind is racing a mile a minute and little will prevent you from sharing your opinions today. Unfortunately, you could talk too much and turn a concise thought into a rambling string of unwieldy concepts that bewilders others. You can state your case clearly if you use fewer words, but don't oversimplify everything by assuming that your actions speak louder than your words. You still must clarify your intentions now since no one will understand your true motivation without a clear explanation. Thankfully, you're a genius at knowing exactly what to say."
pisces,2015-06-08,"It's your second nature to tap into mysterious energies from parallel universes, but you can't always rationally account for the results. The reflective Moon's current visit to your spiritual sign is just the tip of the cosmic iceberg today. Any attempts to resist the otherworldly planetary forces at work now may produce weird results. The outcome is equally difficult if you push your personal agenda too aggressively. Taking a wait-and-see position is your best move to cultivate peace of mind. Give reality a chance to catch up to your colorful imagination."
aries,2015-06-09,"You can become a superhero today, but you must overcome your current tendency to take the course of least resistance and just roll with the incoming waves. Fortunately, warrior Mars is working on your behalf now, assisting you in your task of defying the laws of nature. Discovering the solution to a problem is the easy part; the tricky part is mustering up some uncharacteristic persistence. Once you have a plan, lock onto it with unflagging determination. Don't trade the  satisfaction of a job well done for a shot at transient pleasure. Put on your cape and save the day."
taurus,2015-06-09,"Even the most boring day can have a surprising twist, taking you on an unexpected detour. It's as if you stepped onto a magic carpet that has a mind of its own. You're not in control now, but you might not care because the ride is so enjoyable. Delicious Venus hooks up with dreamy Neptune to manufacture a bit of romantic fantasy. At the very least, join your friends on a social outing, whether or not the activity sounds like fun. You may be pleasantly surprised by what happens when you push outside of your old comfort zone and trust the universe."
gemini,2015-06-09,"People might attempt to talk you into going along with the current group consensus now, but you'll likely break rank to do something on your own. You may try to justify your behavior by blaming it on the present circumstances, but this rebellion is actually your own doing. It's healthier to admit you feel stifled and are in need of the freedom to do as you please. Happily, there's no reason to go along with the crowd today; following your impulsive tendencies will probably be rewarded in ways you can't imagine."
cancer,2015-06-09,"You can't help but feel nervous if coworkers encourage you to step out past your normal limits today. Even if someone's outrageous plan sounds intriguing, the very thought of doing something so unconventional gives you the jitters if you worry about how others will respond. Fortunately, you could receive support from the most unlikely of allies if you're open to it. Go ahead and reach well outside of the box now; once you get a whiff of all the amazing possibilities, there will be no going back."
leo,2015-06-09,"You're sitting on pins and needles today, ready to do something adventurous and risky. You might later regret your impulsive behavior, so give your plans another round of consideration before following a passing whim. Luckily, there's plenty of room for pleasure if you don't approach the situation from an all-or-nothing perspective. Exercising a small amount of caution is probably enough to enable you to have your fair share of fun. You don't have to jump into deep water without a life jacket to prove your courage."
virgo,2015-06-09,"Everyone casts you in a serious light, but the truth is you're a lot more restless today than others realize. If someone around you cuts loose, you're right there, ready to jump in and join him or her on a quick escape. Fortunately, you should be able to get away with having some fun, even before people notice you have slipped away. There's no reason to try and change anyone's perception of you because you will earn more respect if you dance to your own drummer without explaining every move you make."
libra,2015-06-09,"Comparing your idealistic fantasies with your current commitments is an exercise in futility. You really don't want to do the same things in the very same ways you did them last time. You're fascinated by experimental models for living, loving and working -- so nearly anything outside of the ordinary is intriguing today. Be careful; just because you can visualize something in your imagination doesn't mean you should automatically go ahead and make it happen. Practicing a little bit of conscious discernment now goes a long way."
scorpio,2015-06-09,"Your romantic dreams don't necessarily match up with your current relationship dynamics. In fact, even if you are enjoying a fulfilling love life, you still may yearn for additional freedom today. The irony is that if you made your desires known, you might be pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Don't shut yourself off to unrealized possibilities before you take some time out of your schedule to explore them. Initiating action is required to make your fantasies come true."
sagittarius,2015-06-09,"This is an intellectually provocative day and you might find it so stimulating that you don't want it to end. Buoyant Jupiter is magnifying your 9th House of Adventure, and you may be wondering how you will handle the complexity. Your emotions are all over the map and whatever you do now, you could feel as if you should have done something else. Still, the lack of stability heightens your intoxication with the thrill of it all. The energy will likely begin to settle back down tomorrow so enjoy the excitement of this moment while it lasts."
capricorn,2015-06-09,"You might be unhappy with the emotional volatility on the home front and nothing you do seems to settle the turbulence. In fact, it feels as if a volcano could erupt at any moment. You're better off in the long run to ride on the choppy currents, rather than resisting the flow. Thankfully, your anxiety dissipates when you concentrate on maintaining your center of gravity instead of attempting to control every variable in your environment. Thankfully, your sensible behavior acts as a beacon that others can follow."
aquarius,2015-06-09,Nothing seems as easy as it should be today if you're anchored to your past in a way that makes it harder to respond to the present moment. You know what you want but aren't free to execute your plan just yet. Don't let arbitrary restrictions or delays make you so frustrated that you impulsively do something reckless. Proceed carefully now and think twice before making any unnecessary moves; rest assured you have more time than you think to change the world.
pisces,2015-06-09,"You're eager to try something that seems so out of character now that it takes someone in your life totally by surprise. Unfortunately, people might criticize you for your erratic behavior today, mistakenly believing you're acting immature and irresponsible. This is your moment of truth, regardless of anyone else's expectations or demands. Make an original statement about who you are and what you want by staying true to yourself."
aries,2015-06-10,"You are working with a short emotional fuse while the Moon is agitating reactionary Aries, and your shoot-from-the-hip delivery could turn a sticky situation into a real problem. Thankfully, a little common sense goes a long way to prevent a meltdown over a misunderstanding that won't matter much in the long run. However, if you get caught up in the heat of the moment and choose to express your feelings, at least minimize the potential damage by accepting responsibility for your role in the current disagreement. It takes two to tangle but only one to walk away."
taurus,2015-06-10,"Although you may need to work with someone whose long-term goals aren't the same as yours, at least try to see things from an open-minded perspective today. Instead of allowing your exasperation to explode in an unpleasant interaction, take the high road and acknowledge that your differences don't have to impact your collaboration in a negative way. You can be true to yourself, even while putting patience ahead of insecurity. The sooner you cooperate, the sooner you're done."
gemini,2015-06-10,"A sudden imbalance of power could rear its ugly head today. You might believe others are working against your personal interests, yet no one is honest enough to come out and say anything directly. Your best response to this awkward situation is to remain as optimistic as possible, even if you grow more irritated throughout the day. Relying on your natural friendliness and adaptability enables you to dance around the unpleasant edges of conflict without getting your feet dirty."
cancer,2015-06-10,"Expressing negativity isn't always appropriate or appreciated, but letting your anger loose today could be a sign of strength. Often, your reaction is to withdraw emotionally when stressed, leading to passive-aggressive behavior. Nevertheless, frustration can push you to the edge now, provoking you to lose control if you aren't aware of your own inner process. Denying your feelings only makes matters worse, so share your concerns without getting hooked by your attachment to what others think. Keeping it real is most useful if you also keep it kind."
leo,2015-06-10,"Your friends seem dissatisfied with your actions today, yet you don't believe that you're doing anything wrong. However, adopting a cosmic perspective reveals everyone is performing a role in your personal drama and it's just plain annoying if the actors aren't following your script. Even if others seem to be the source of the problem, continue to bring your focus back to your feelings. Ironically enough, once you take responsibility for your part, the erratic energy should begin to settle down. Lead by example and hopefully others will follow."
virgo,2015-06-10,"An anxious coworker may step over the line today. Rather than avoiding direct confrontation, initiate an open dialogue about the current tension. However, applying force isn't helpful nor does assuming an authoritative posture resolve the issue because the truth will come to the surface when you least expect it. But if you choose to nudge the process along, get right to the point. Properly considered words are effective agents of change if they are delivered with good intentions and kindness."
libra,2015-06-10,"People seem impossible to read today. You might go out of your way to accommodate others, but your amicable behavior currently increases your frustration and your uncertainty. Paradoxically, the friendlier you are now, the worse you feel on the inside. Trust your instincts, even if you don't have the facts to support them. But don't start a fight with an imaginary opponent; shadowboxing will only tire you out without leading to a solution. Continue to gather information before confronting anyone with the truth. There's no need to play games with those you love."
scorpio,2015-06-10,"Keep your nose clean now or you might get pulled into an unnecessary conflict before you know it. However, don't be afraid to shake up the status quo if your intentions are honorable and your goal is worthwhile. Nevertheless, powerful emotions are stewing on the back burner and you're right to worry that they could hijack your day. Fortunately, you can pull a rabbit out of a hat by taking an entirely radical approach. Seize the day and don't look back."
sagittarius,2015-06-10,"Everything would be perfect today, but someone may not be playing according to your rules. It might even feel as if a rain cloud is threatening your parade, even though it's still sunny on your side of the street. There's no reason to let fear dampen your current enthusiasm. You don't have to outrun bad weather; instead, head off the developing storms by proactively confronting any negativity. Unaddressed issues are the only scary ones. Tilt the odds even further in your favor by avoiding the blame game; the final outcome is influenced by your positive attitude more than anything else."
capricorn,2015-06-10,"Your strong resolve can block out some of today's tension, but choosing to remain unaware of it only deepens the problem. The self-determined Aries Moon raises concerns about how your personal story is unfolding and who ultimately controls your destiny. It's counterproductive to slip into denial now, so play the role of the rebel and bring differences out into the open while you have the chance. Confrontation may be inevitable, but your willingness to compromise offers lasting solutions to the current turmoil."
aquarius,2015-06-10,"Life seems so hectic today that you're actually worried something could fall apart unless you watch your immediate environment like a hawk. You prefer playing your cards only once you determine you are ready. However, you might be forced to make your move in response to someone else's behavior. Don't panic and overreact; just walk away from the table and return to the game after you have collected your thoughts. Your strategy and execution will improve once your feelings are back in line with your heart."
pisces,2015-06-10,"Being swept up in a wave of social activism won't likely help your personal life, but it can still be a good thing in the long run. If you find yourself spending all your free time with people who think like you, go ahead and ride the surge while it lasts. However, this moment of heightened activity might be a temporary passion for you, even if it's a lifelong commitment for others. Let your compassionate nature shine; your current journey teaches you a priceless lesson about your place in the world."
aries,2015-06-11,"You might have been caught in intellectual cross-currents recently as Mercury retrograded in your 3rd House of Communication. Although life seems more hectic than ever, the tide is about to change and the noise will soon transform into exciting opportunities for growth. Don't waste time second-guessing your choices; it's time to launch your ship of ideas into the seas of commerce. Some journeys are worth a leap of faith."
taurus,2015-06-11,"Although it's been more work than play lately, your progress continues to be slower than you prefer. If you have done your homework, things will finally begin to go your way. However, the change will not happen overnight, but you can feel it in the wind, nonetheless. Mercury's direct turn in airy Gemini inspires you to soar above the mundane world. There isn't a better sensation than to have your wings lifted by a steady breeze that carries you to great heights."
gemini,2015-06-11,"Your nerves are on edge, but finding a healthy outlet for your restlessness may be enough to turn the energy around. You've been longing to travel, but circumstances continue to stand between you and your wanderlust. Ultimately, it's about your incessant need for mental stimulation. You might have reached a saturation point in your current situation, and must find new adventures to catalyze your thinking. Hang on to your hat; the universe is about to grant you your wish."
cancer,2015-06-11,"You may be dreaming about sneaking off to a monastery for a spiritual retreat when no one is looking. You're in a contemplative phase and might be overwhelmed by all your choices. Thankfully, this period of isolation only lasts a few more days and hopefully gives you the chance to gain a new emotional awareness. There's no reason to be fearful of being alone, but also don't be afraid of putting your thoughts out into the open. If you want something magical to happen, it's time to make your move."
leo,2015-06-11,"It feels as if many personal demands have been placed on your doorstep over the past few weeks, requiring you to participate in more social activities than you prefer. Thankfully, your way of relating to others is on the precipice of change. Although you may still be involved with a group of like-minded people, you're more inclined to engage with them in a voluntary capacity rather than out of obligation. Find a way to step beyond your personal needs; your generosity of spirit will be returned to you many times over."
virgo,2015-06-11,"You're not usually one to waste words, yet you may be entangled in endless conversations at work these days without much to show for your efforts. The bad news is your frustration level continues to escalate. The good news is you are at a turning point and progress could be just around the corner now that your key planet Mercury is turning direct in your 10th House of Career. There's no reason to express your dissatisfaction. Just strive for excellence and be thankful when you start to reap dividends over the days ahead."
libra,2015-06-11,"Thoughts of an exotic journey have been floating around in your brain but you know better than most that there's more than one way to take a trip. Learning expands your mind in the same way that travel does, and you don't even have to leave the comforts of home. You may have felt like circumstances prevented you from following your curiosity, but now you're ready to begin a new chapter in your life. Even if it's just a fantasy, it's time to pack your bags and go."
scorpio,2015-06-11,"You secretly enjoy thinking about things that are out of bounds for most people. You're naturally comfortable delving into the mysteries of sex, death and the meaning of life, but recently your thoughts have left you feeling dazed and confused. Now, as Mercury moves direct, you will have an opportunity to share some of your metaphysical ideas with someone who understands your darker side. Go deep; your words have a more profound effect on others now than you will ever know."
sagittarius,2015-06-11,"Intimate conversations may have been turned inside out recently, creating unnecessary misunderstandings. But rather than quickly moving on to new business, it is an opportune time to slow down and revisit these serious issues. Discussions that were previously impossible now unfold without the heavy baggage that had initially accompanied them. Remember, it's not enough to tell your side of the story today. Listen attentively to the feedback you receive from everyone else. Communication is a two-way street so don't block the exchange of ideas."
capricorn,2015-06-11,"Focusing on the details of life is enough to jog your memory today. Since Mercury has been busy doing its retrograde thing in your 6th House of Habits, any changes to your daily routine should take all the facts into account before you create more trouble. Dig into the issues when complications arise because the real action occurs wherever you place your attention. Don't be fooled into diverting your energy into unimportant tasks. Set ambitious priorities and stick to them like glue."
aquarius,2015-06-11,"If you recently backpedaled in a romantic venture, it's now time to stage your comeback. Grab your favorite pen and write a letter to the person who is the object of your affection. No doubt, emailing or texting isn't as effective but will do the trick. No matter what medium you use today, open your heart and lay your feelings on the line. Believe it or not, rejection isn't the worst thing that could happen. Keeping your unexpressed desires to yourself is a worse fate because you'll never know what kind of love might blossom until you try."
pisces,2015-06-11,"A recent visit to a familiar childhood haunt may have stirred up a flood of memories. Or, perhaps, a conversation with a dear friend or relative started you thinking about the good old days. Regardless of the catalyst, you might be going through a phase when nostalgia takes you on a magical mystery tour. Although you have much to gain from remembering your past, don't dwell in it. In order to embrace your future, you must be one hundred percent present in the here and now."
aries,2015-06-12,"An unfinished relationship discussion may resurface today, as if a recently dispatched issue was waiting in the wings to be called back onstage. Much to your chagrin, if you weren't able to fix the problem earlier, you won't likely solve it now, either. Paradoxically, the harder you strive for resolution, the more elusive the answers become. Nevertheless, gently leaning into the resistance is still the most strategic tactic because the energy is about to shift, freeing you to move on."
taurus,2015-06-12,"You may believe that you can power your way through any obstacle you encounter at work today, but the Moon in your sign is telling you to slow down and go with the flow. Instead of trying to prove your competence, you'e better off taking the time to figure out what you're doing wrong first. Dogged persistence is not as successful now as establishing a bulletproof plan based on the facts at hand. Build your strategy one brick at a time to create the strongest foundation."
gemini,2015-06-12,"Don't expect anyone else to understand what you're talking about today because the reflective Moon's visit to your 12th House of Spirituality puts you in touch with metaphysical truths that aren't easily explained. Your colleagues won't likely follow your cosmic ramblings just because your thoughts make perfect sense to you. It doesn't matter if you can see the beautiful complexity of the entire universe; your best bet now is to stick with the simplest approach when it comes to connecting with others, nonetheless. Perhaps it's wise to be silent; sometimes the magic is for your eyes only."
cancer,2015-06-12,"Your friends are willing to show up for you today, so asking them for support shouldn't be such a big deal. You might not like the idea of putting yourself in a vulnerable position, but revealing your true self creates a more balanced flow of energy between you and everyone else. Obviously, you want to feel safe when sharing your insecurities, but you can still follow the advice of a trusted companion without worrying too much about the consequences. Normally, you excel at nurturing those you love, but now it's time to gracefully receive the generosity of others."
leo,2015-06-12,"You are tempted to play the role of a caretaker today, even if you secretly don't want anyone to depend on you too much. Luckily, you have an uncanny ability to know how to quickly win others over to your side. Don't be scared of acting without full justification; the outcome should be favorable as long as you maintain a high level of integrity. Thankfully, you won't likely go wrong if you stick to your true convictions and work for the greater good of everyone involved."
virgo,2015-06-12,"You have ample reason to believe your goals are within reach. But even if you struggle with your confidence because of recent setbacks, things should finally begin to turn around today. Nevertheless, you're a tough critic to please and it can be difficult to reserve your judgment long enough to accept life as it is and people as they are. Luckily, you gain the gift of a truly empowering vision once you commit to taking the high road and giving others the benefit of the doubt."
libra,2015-06-12,The romantic energy you're feeling could be overpowered today by a disagreement regarding your life path. Your dreamy mood might suddenly dissipate as it's overtaken by fears that arise from the depths of your subconscious. The Moon's presence in your 8th House of Transformation suggests a lot of emotional turmoil exists beneath the surface. Don't attempt to cling to the current moment as a matter of pride; letting the present recede into the past makes room for a brighter future.
scorpio,2015-06-12,"You might wear yourself out trying to keep up with everything that's happening before you finally find a groove and settle into a regular pattern. Although completing what's expected of you shouldn't be a problem, your life may be more complicated now than you wish. Instead of frantically attempting to get back to the basics, resign yourself to living with the current glorious complexity until it begins to simplify on its own. This might sound scary for the weak of heart but, fortunately, you Scorpios are at your best when you rise to the challenge."
sagittarius,2015-06-12,"Maintaining your focus isn't as straightforward as it should be today. Nevertheless, you still might try to complete one-too-many tasks, even if common sense tells you to pare back your calendar immediately. Surprisingly, you can accomplish everything you set your mind to if you're conscientious about being practical with your promises. Success now depends on your ability to say no again and again to the incoming parade of distractions. Ultimately, it's your unwavering desire to be productive that keeps you on course. The mind can do anything; you are the master of your own destiny."
capricorn,2015-06-12,"Although you can be more successful than you thought possible today, you also might feel as if you're missing something crucial. Without a doubt, there's more going on than meets the eye now, yet you can't put your finger on it. Forget about solving an unsolvable mystery; instead, make a commitment to accomplish what you can and then get to work. If you want to reach the mountaintop, there's no time to waste."
aquarius,2015-06-12,"You begin your day knowing exactly where you want to channel your creative energy, yet you grow less certain as the hours pass. New possibilities are revealed now and each has its own merit. Nevertheless, the choice is ultimately up to you. You're the only one who can decide how to connect your goals with those of everyone else. Fulfilling  your own desires alone won't emotionally satisfy you today, so consider the needs of your companions, too, if you want to have a happy heart."
pisces,2015-06-12,"You are incredibly busy today with the Moon stomping around in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Fortunately, you can remain totally focused even with all the distractions clamoring for your attention. You are fully committed to delivering on your promises and won't be led astray by those things that would normally catch your eye. Your coworkers may think you're a bit obsessive now, but you're not even listening to their objections. You know you're on the right track; make the most of this cosmic momentum while it lasts."
aries,2015-06-13,"You are dangerously close to reaching your boiling point today and may struggle to keep a lid on your volatile emotions. Militant Mars is your ruling planet, tuning you into trouble before it even happens. Although the warrior planet is combining forces with the willful Sun, you can consciously use this energy for a positive cause instead of succumbing to its negativity. Stand up for an underdog or defend an idea that's close to your heart. Take the high road by choosing your battles carefully and fighting fairly for the good of all."
taurus,2015-06-13,"You may not be comfortable expressing your anger, but you can still be a formidable opponent if people push you too far. Although someone could challenge your motives, you're able to exhibit a great deal of patience today. Keeping your emotions in check seems like your best option now, but you might not stifle your annoyance for long if your values are called into question. Unfortunately, the stress won't likely pass until you confront its source. Assuming the role of the peaceful warrior is the most effective way to resolve the tension."
gemini,2015-06-13,"You might be more argumentative than usual today and your clever wit can't seem to save you from yourself. Feisty Mars is traveling hand-in-hand with the Sun in your sign, and whatever you do now appears to fan the flames of conflict as the friction grows. Nevertheless, the outcome of the current situation is still within your control. You could waste precious energy in a fight that won't likely matter in the long run or you can summon up enough courage to just walk away. The choice is yours."
cancer,2015-06-13,"It's easy for you to use your intuition to see what's going on behind the scenes, but sharing your feelings with your friends is more complicated than simply observing them. Your greatest challenge now is to express the truth exactly as you see it, while knowing that you may have to actively defend your beliefs. If you decide to speak your opinion today, avoid getting mired down in the details. Concentrating on the big picture makes sense as long as you don't let your philosophical approach supersede the facts staring at you in the face."
leo,2015-06-13,"Making a dramatic gesture may be your unconscious way of showing resistance today because you're not interested in participating in a plan that doesn't support your dreams. If you don't want to make too many waves about your difference of opinion, engaging in physical activity will help you to let off some steam. However, there's a good chance that your plans will backfire if you don't express yourself one way or another. Proceed carefully; blowing your cool could alienate the very same people you want to have on your team."
virgo,2015-06-13,"You're motivated to take on the world today with the superhero Sun-Mars conjunction activating your 10th House of Responsibility. But it's difficult now to follow one task through to the end before finding yourself distracted with another one. Thankfully, you can reach into your metaphysical toolbox and pull out a dose of practicality to counteract the scattered energy. Picking one project and sticking with it leads to a higher level of satisfaction than running around in circles without having anything to show for your efforts at the end of the day."
libra,2015-06-13,"You often excel at playing the diplomat, but peacekeeping isn't your primary motivating force today. You're not as quick to acquiesce to the demands of others while warrior Mars hooks up with the willful Sun in your 9th House of Adventure. You want to make something monumental happen in your life and won't let anyone stand in your way now. Although you mean well, your actions may be charged with a combative tone that provokes conflict. Be smart; if you unwittingly agitate someone's ire, apologize and retreat before things spin out of control. The good news is it's possible to be assertive without being aggressive."
scorpio,2015-06-13,"You are quite a force of nature while the Sun illuminates your key planet Mars. It's not easy to act in moderation now, especially if you currently lack a healthy perspective. You might not even stop to think about your long-term trajectory; you just push toward your immediate goal and overpower anyone who resists your efforts. But the fact of the matter is your friends and family can be your greatest asset if you include them in your plans. Be on your best behavior while manifesting your future or you may waste a cosmic opportunity to get what you want."
sagittarius,2015-06-13,"You could inadvertently overwhelm people with your lofty intentions, yet you might have a crisis of confidence today if you don't have a strong support system in place. The combative Sun-Mars conjunction falls in your 7th House of Others, flooding your system with so much adrenaline now that you might project your own anger onto anyone who crosses your path. Strong convictions are useful to accomplish your goals as long as you tone down your approach until everyone else is on the same page as you. Gentle is the new strong."
capricorn,2015-06-13,"You're typically quite proficient at taming the contentious energy of hot-under-the-collar Mars. However, you're tempted to ride roughshod over other people's needs today in order to stick to your regular routine. Fortunately, a friendly Taurus Moon reminds you that taking a simpler and kinder path is the wiser choice today. Believe it or not, it's not mandatory to have every little thing go your way; quit micromanaging your day and you'll be happier in the long run. Compassion and consideration cultivate respect."
aquarius,2015-06-13,"You might be so excited about a project now that you ignore your friends as you pursue your ambitions. It's all too easy to forget about what anyone else thinks as the Sun-Mars conjunction fires up your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, the support you receive could make all the difference in the world, so slow down and explain your intentions. Sharing your plans helps you clarify your next steps. Dreaming out loud with loved ones recharges your creative batteries and warms your heart."
pisces,2015-06-13,"There could be so many things going on at home today that you don't know where to jump in. The action-packed Sun-Mars conjunction falls in your 4h House of Domestic Conditions, emphasizing your personal life. However, it's not time to simply close down and drop out of sight. You can create a communication whirlwind if you pick up your phone, get online or directly engage those who are in your immediate environment. The positive energy you stir up now sets a harmonious tone for the weeks ahead."
aries,2015-06-14,"Change is in the air today, but you can't figure out which direction the wind is blowing. At first, you may be excited with anticipation as you map out your schedule for the near future, only to be drawn back into old fears. Your memories could bring up unexpected anger that prevents you from swiftly processing your emotions. Don't be so judgmental if you aren't living up to your own ambitious expectations. Instead of comparing the present with the past, focus strictly on the power of now so you can gain the most out of your current experiences."
taurus,2015-06-14,"Enjoy the relaxed pace while you can because circumstances will likely grow more complex as the day unfolds. Being pressured to respond doesn't necessarily make you feel good and others may encounter the brunt of your frustration instead of your support. Thankfully, you don't have to play the role of the spoiler if you keep communication channels open from the beginning. It's simpler to be honest about your resistance than to explain yourself after someone's feelings have already been hurt. A stitch in time saves nine."
gemini,2015-06-14,"You instinctively know that you must take decisive action today, but there seems to be too many choices vying for your attention. You may worry that you might miss a significant opportunity because you are so caught up in current events while the Moon is busy raising a ruckus in your sign. Don't give up just because it seems like others are trying to prevent you from following your guiding light. Keeping your dreams alive is crucial for your soul, even if fulfillment isn't in the immediate picture."
cancer,2015-06-14,"In theory, you like the idea of being part of a tightly-knit family, but you can do without all the day-to-day dramas that seem to be part of the package now. However, you haven't necessarily failed if you think you're falling short of your personal goals. Looking back to gauge your success only leads to self-doubt. Live in the present moment while fully experiencing the intensity of your current feelings instead of retreating to your past. The future is calling so let go of your baggage and move on."
leo,2015-06-14,"You may appear highly energetic and overly enthusiastic today, but your inner world could be less cheery than anyone realizes. You know you must continue to push forward, which is why you are wearing a smile and trying to assume a positive attitude. Even though it might seem as if you can't shake your current disillusionment, you do have the power to snap yourself out of your malaise if you so choose. Instead of seeking perfection, just practice accepting things as they are now and finding joy in the moment."
virgo,2015-06-14,"Your high ideals and unrealized dreams can only motivate you so far; you also must connect with the mundane side of your life today. Anything that helps you keep your feet on the ground should be actively pursued now-- especially practices that blend a spiritual perspective with physical movement, such as martial arts or yoga. Committing to disciplined activity can be part of a larger plan that distracts you from obsessing about unfulfilled fantasies and puts you on track to a more fulfilling life."
libra,2015-06-14,"One of your primary roads to personal growth is through your continuing exploration of relationships. However, your current analysis could lead you to the disappointing conclusion that your present state of affairs is quite different than your idealistic dreams. Stop the self-criticism before you sink into uncertainty, since judging yourself harshly only limits your potential at this time. Focusing on the positive aspects of others enables you to regain your confidence and cultivate deeper levels of friendship and intimacy."
scorpio,2015-06-14,"You might have a sneaking suspicion today that you've been shortchanged and something important is missing in your life. Unfortunately, this reflection of residual childhood longings isn't just a passing whim. In fact, somber Saturn is retrograding back into your sign to remind you that there's still work to be done balancing your current trajectory with your earlier expectations. Exploring memories can help you gain insight, but releasing old anger and resentment frees you to find real happiness in the here and now."
sagittarius,2015-06-14,"Friends and family may be the current source of drama that begs for your involvement. Nevertheless, it's probably best to observe the unfolding circumstances from a comfortable distance if they don't directly concern you. Unnecessarily worrying about matters peripheral to your main priorities only stresses you out now. You could even complicate the situation today by adding your two cents before anyone asks. Establishing a clear boundary and sticking to it works to everyone's advantage, especially yours."
capricorn,2015-06-14,"No matter how much you have accomplished so far in your life, you still may fall short of your own unattainable ambitions. Nevertheless, you can't travel your individual road to happiness until you understand what motivates you to be successful. Unquestionably, you can learn a lot about yourself by reexamining your personal history from time to time. It's not about arriving at your destination now; the true measure of success comes from knowing which path to take."
aquarius,2015-06-14,"Last night's discouraging dream may still linger on your mind after you wake up today. Unfortunately, it's no easy task to untangle the symbolic meaning of this otherworldly message from your subconscious. Forget about explaining your feelings to anyone else now. Instead, head back into the uncomfortable shadows and let the strange images wash over you without any fear. There's no doubt about it: you have a special destiny to fulfill. Meditating on your dreams is the first step to deciphering the mystery of your future."
pisces,2015-06-14,"Everywhere you look you can't help but see that so many people are dissatisfied with their lives. Your deep compassion for their failures may also be the source of your current disillusionment. However, your dreams are so vivid now that their clarity reminds you of the stark difference between your imagination and reality. But don't waste time analyzing everything that's wrong with your world. Instead, consciously focus on something that has solid potential. Channel your efforts toward positively changing what you can and leave everything else to the universe."
aries,2015-06-15,"You aren't likely to take no for an answer today, but you might have to think on your feet and do some fast talking to receive the approval you seek. You could grow frustrated if you are swept up by interpersonal politics that are beyond your control. But don't quit too soon, since gentle persistence will probably bring you what you want. However, four planets buzzing in adaptable Gemini remind you that maintaining a flexible attitude is essential to keep up with how quickly the circumstances are changing."
taurus,2015-06-15,"You need more time to integrate all the information at your disposal but it's difficult to think while more data is still coming in. In fact, one distraction after another keeps you hopping today. Thankfully, the intensity begins to settle down as tomorrow's New Moon approaches, giving you enough peace and quiet to actually hear your own thoughts. Meditation eventually produces feelings of contentment, but the real trick is to learn how to find your balance even while you're busy."
gemini,2015-06-15,"If you think your needs will go unmet today, it's probably because your moods are shifting so rapidly while the Moon is camped out in your fickle sign. You may receive exactly what you want, only to have your desires morph into something else. Thankfully, your friends and associates are fairly easygoing now about your restlessness, so there's no reason to hide your feelings. Building better relationships starts with keeping others informed about your unfolding emotional process. You are free to take flight once everyone is on the same page."
cancer,2015-06-15,"You might believe you have to keep something private today. However, once you start telling your story, your need for secrecy is unexpectedly overshadowed by a strong desire for transparency. Luckily, you may suddenly realize you don't have to hide as much as you often do. Your growing excitement about being validated by your peers can have you sharing your feelings before you even have a chance to consider the consequences. Although it's time to come out from behind your castle wall, you don't have to overwhelm everyone all at once. A little disclosure goes a long way."
leo,2015-06-15,"You can't hold your tongue once your focus shifts from listening to actively participating in a discussion. You may have valid concerns for your recent trepidation, but progress on several fronts today wins out over your resistance. Any reasons you might have to remain silent are obliterated by the chatty Gemini Moon moving through your 11th House of Social Networking. You need to engage with others now more than you need your autonomy. Choosing a path of collaboration leads to the road of success."
virgo,2015-06-15,"Although you're quite capable of building a case for what you want today, a logical presentation doesn't assure that you will make noticeable progress right away. Nevertheless, this isn't a sensible time to back down, since your words have more momentum these days than you realize. Facing external resistance might actually be the result of projecting your own internal fears. Overcoming apparent obstacles may take more time than you wish, but the potential payoff is definitely worth the sustained effort."
libra,2015-06-15,"You're quick to take center stage today, especially if you're offered a chance to tell others about your adventurous plans. Your typically gracious approach may be lost as you face the fear of being misunderstood by a coworker or a friend. You might think that raising your volume will compensate for your current insecurity. However, this impulsive strategy could backfire by prompting people to hastily withdraw. Luckily, the ultimate viability of your ideas isn't affected by someone else's acceptance or rejection. The only opinion that matters right now is yours."
scorpio,2015-06-15,"People may become anxious today if they're uncomfortable handling intense emotions, leaving you uncertain about sharing what's going on in your heart. Unfortunately, suppressing what you want to say only makes matters worse even if you have the kindest of intentions. However, the interactive Gemini Moon provokes you to take a risk and express your feelings without expecting anything in return. Be gentle; if others don't feel threatened by your passion, they might just surprise you by sticking around and participating in an amazing discussion about things that truly matter."
sagittarius,2015-06-15,"Intriguing people enter your life now, making it impossible to turn down an invitation to learn something new. But connections with others aren't as stable as you think while the changeable Gemini Moon illuminates your 7th House of Relationships, filling the day with one noisy interaction after another. Luckily, you're not required to discover the meaning of life today; all you need to do is soak in as much information as possible and be grateful for the experiences as they happen."
capricorn,2015-06-15,"You might not be able to shut off your over-analytical thinking today, even if a constant flow of ingenious thoughts are spinning around inside your head. Your pragmatic approach to life prefers one solid thought to lots of ephemeral ones. Nevertheless, it may be fine to let go of your current expectations if you don't need to produce anything tangible now. Allow your mind to wander, since you will instinctively come back to center when the time is right. Stretching your imagination will ultimately reward you with something positive to show for your mental meanderings."
aquarius,2015-06-15,"You really don't have to demonstrate your cleverness today since those who know you already recognize your intelligence. Rather than overstating your case or rambling on too long about your latest greatest idea, just show up and be real. There's no reason to use words to prove your point because your brilliance shines through your actions as physical Mars aligns with the radiant Sun in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Walk your talk and see who follows."
pisces,2015-06-15,"You could find yourself exploring new feelings today, but you're more content with just getting your feet wet now than jumping into deeper waters. It's quite natural to skip over the top of several complex issues while four planets in light-footed Gemini tap dance through your 4th House of Emotional Security. Consider your current inquiry as an initial test drive only. Wait until after tomorrow's New Moon to draw any conclusions from this reconnaissance mission."
aries,2015-06-16,"There are so many things you want to start today that you can't keep up with your own agenda. The noisy Gemini New Moon joins forces with impetuous Mars in your 3rd House of Information, filling your mind with data that can actually prevent you from seeking the deeper meaning of your experiences. You may be preoccupied with all the external commotion now, while wishing you had a chance to seek the pleasures you believe are waiting for you somewhere nearby. Keep your dreams alive by talking about them when you can. Don't lose hope; your time will come sooner than you think."
taurus,2015-06-16,"You're unabashedly concerned about money now that the Gemini New Moon is activating your 2nd House of Resources. Unfortunately, you might not be able to fully relax until your material world feels secure. It's quite disconcerting if you're consumed by the realization that you're not as financially comfortable as you wish. Nevertheless, nothing is preventing you from reconsidering where to go next. But you must make a choice today; you can always change your mind along the way. Prosperity is yours for the taking."
gemini,2015-06-16,"If you're all tangled up in your thoughts now, remember that curiosity is a common Gemini trait and you need to play out all the alternatives before narrowing it down to just one. However, the inquisitive Gemini New Moon prompts you to obsess over irrelevant details. It's natural to feel a bit lost in your own mental maze, but you're perfectly safe and exactly where you need to be today. Ruthlessly exploring every option available empowers you to make the best choice for your future."
cancer,2015-06-16,"Your powerful dreams serve a very important purpose now, and you would quickly lose interest in your future without the inspiration they provide. You often look back to the past when you are worried about what's ahead, but the mischievous Gemini New Moon dancing in your 12th House of Destiny may have your fantasies working on overdrive. Try not to push your current concerns away; instead, embrace your thoughts as messages from within. But be ready to take them to the next level by giving yourself permission to reach for the stars."
leo,2015-06-16,"If you're struggling to hold on to the status quo at work, it's helpful to reassess your goals while the clever Gemini New Moon is triggering your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes. Your mental agility enables you to run circles around others now. However, you must also be willing to learn something new about yourself or people will think you're just playing games. There's no need to bluff your way through the situation as long as you stay open to the lessons at hand. Being a student of life keeps you in touch with the wonders of the world."
virgo,2015-06-16,"Others are supporting your pursuit of a particular professional path now that the interactive Gemini New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Career. However, you have additional goals that might not be recognizable by your current choices. Thankfully, it isn't necessary to reveal your inner conflicts yet. In fact, sharing your true feelings today only confuses your coworkers and complicates matters even more. Research your options in the privacy of your own mind before putting them out in the open for everyone to see."
libra,2015-06-16,"You are highly motivated to let go of desires that only have a small chance of being fulfilled as the whimsical Gemini New Moon highlights your 9th House of Big Ideas. You have reached a fork in the road where you're eager to make dramatic changes in order to spice up your life. Even if you're impatient to embark on your next adventure, you still have to put your plans in order. Don't sweat the small stuff today; concentrate on your exciting long-term goals rather than the tedious details of the day."
scorpio,2015-06-16,Be careful about complicating a tricky situation today as the scattered Gemini New Moon influences your 8th House of Intimacy. You are fueled by an insatiable desire to explain the unexplainable as you drive toward achieving your lofty goals. Your current assumption that the outcome will be an all-or-nothing one muddies the waters even more. The best way to avoid problems in the future is to be honest in the present. Keep all communication channels clear of any possible misunderstandings by being more transparent in all of your interactions.
sagittarius,2015-06-16,"You could be struggling to find a healthy balance between pursuing your dreams and living up to everyone else's expectations. The dualistic Gemini New Moon falls in your 7th House of Relationships, tempting you to leave your fate in the hands of others. Your current dilemma stems from your illusion that you can have it both ways now. Thankfully, your diplomatic skills rise to the occasion, but you still must eventually make your choice because you can't serve two masters at once. Don't get swept up in the moment and rush your decision; allow plenty of time for your inner voice to make itself heard."
capricorn,2015-06-16,"A coworker might believe you are acting selfishly today, but you know that you must attend to your own needs before you can truly help those around you. You may feel a bit overwhelmed now with everything that's going on; you won't be much good to yourself or anyone else until you establish a workable rhythm in your everyday life. Nevertheless, the information-rich Gemini New Moon lands in your 6th House of Daily Routine, enabling you to increase your efficiency so you have the time and energy to be of service to others."
aquarius,2015-06-16,"You may be so quick to change your story for each new audience that it's hard to know where you stand on any given subject today. Meanwhile, the flexible Gemini New Moon inspires your 5th House of Romance, motivating you to share your heart's desires. But don't be overly concerned about impressing anyone with your song and dance; if you please yourself, everyone else will jump on your bandwagon now. Being loved starts with learning to love yourself more."
pisces,2015-06-16,"You're highly protective of your home and family because subconsciously you realize that everything can't stay the same forever. The fickle Gemini New Moon occupies your 4th House of Foundations today, prompting you to overcompensate and justify your behavior as you cling to familiar feelings. Ironically, it's your attachment to the past that destabilizes the present. Instead of resisting the inevitable, become a secret agent of change."
aries,2015-06-17,"Remaining quiet might seem like a sensible strategy today, but you can't avoid conflict by simply relying on defensive maneuvers. Even if you try to keep your feelings to yourself, unexpressed emotions have an uncanny way of leaking into interactions and hijacking your day. It isn't fun to lose your temper, so get your concerns out into the open now instead of naively assuming that things will improve on their own. Transparency is your friend."
taurus,2015-06-17,"Interactions with others flow so smoothly today that you may think you're missing something. Ironically, the truth is you're probably glossing over a critical fact or conveniently forgetting what you were told earlier. Fortunately, you can consciously choose to focus on the details of your conversations. The simple act of bringing your awareness to the present moment helps to prevent an unnecessary misunderstanding. Be here now and the future will fall into place."
gemini,2015-06-17,"Your nervous system is on high alert these days, but you really don't want others to know how fast your mind is buzzing. Your calm exterior is your secret weapon against being swept up in another distraction today. You need some space because you don't want to slow down your current thinking process. Your thoughts are free to explore new territory if you don't have to explain yourself every step of the way."
cancer,2015-06-17,"You wish you could talk about your feelings now that the Moon is happily back in your sign, but you might be feeling too shy. You don't want to make anyone uncomfortable, so you won't likely go out of your way to bring up a sensitive topic that could provoke someone to withdraw. However, it's easier to acknowledge your intense emotions once you understand that your abandonment issues can precipitate exactly what you're trying to avoid. Go ahead and face your fears; bringing them out into the open is the first step to overcoming them for good."
leo,2015-06-17,"Don't blindly trust anyone who promises you the world because they're not telling you the entire story now while the Moon is playing hide and seek in your 12th House of Secrets. Take care of important business as if you are riding solo today, even if others enthusiastically offer to help you. It's fine to listen to those who are supportive of your cause, but don't expect them to have the answers you seek. Ultimately, you are your own hero; the faith you have in yourself is what matters most."
virgo,2015-06-17,"You will likely play your hand close to the chest today because you don't want to upset your friends or destabilize any existing relationships. Unfortunately, it may be impossible to avoid a confrontation if someone attempts to manipulate your feelings. The nurturing Cancer Moon is highlighting your 11th House of Social Networks, encouraging you to protect those you love. Do whatever is necessary to defend your home territory as long as you don't intentionally hurt anyone else in the process."
libra,2015-06-17,"Your need to help others at work can make you feel indispensable today while the Moon is waxing in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Unfortunately, uninvited meddling in people's affairs could also create a real mess, especially if you go too far. Don't fall into the trap of over-inflated self-importance. Your coworkers might actually get along just fine without your assistance now. Wait until someone asks you before jumping in and taking over. Focusing on perfecting your own performance allows you to lead by example without saying a word."
scorpio,2015-06-17,"You may tenaciously latch onto a fascinating idea and run with it today, even if it's not a very practical one. You might not have time to seriously develop your strategy, but you still can derive pleasure from just playing out all the possibilities in your mind. However, you could turn a rather simple desire into such a big deal that the original thought is lost in the noise. Give yourself permission to dream, but don't lose perspective on what's real and what's not."
sagittarius,2015-06-17,"Sometimes keeping your most amazing ideas under wraps is the best path to making your dreams come true. You are continuing to ride several days of exciting cosmic waves, yet you could spoil your chances for success if you reveal too much about your plans. Instead of talking about your ideas with anyone who will listen, focus on putting the details into place first. Although you often get away with developing your strategy on the fly, a more cautious approach now works to your advantage."
capricorn,2015-06-17,"You are usually wise enough to be the self-restrained one in your group, but all bets are off today. It's not that your emotions are out of control now; it's just that being aligned with a higher purpose adds intensity to everything you do. Luckily, your friends and coworkers trust you enough to listen with an open mind as you unfold your strategy. Don't blow this chance to explain exactly what you're thinking, even if you aren't sure yet how all the pieces will ultimately fit together. The feedback you receive might be the missing link to your success story."
aquarius,2015-06-17,"You're not all that comfortable with so many images and ideas swirling around in your brain now, leaving you unsure of how to manage the chaos. But instead of disengaging from the real world to dream about your future today, concentrate on a single destination and maintain your focus until you make measurable progress. Applying your creativity doesn't mean wasting your time in fantasyland; developing a step-by-step plan that places your goals within reach is your ticket to success."
pisces,2015-06-17,"Although people see you as quietly confident today, you might not have that much to say yet because you secretly lack certainty about your direction. You're on a creative surge with the evocative Moon inspiring your 5th House of Self-Expression, but the real action is taking place within your imagination and out of sight from anyone's watchful gaze. Don't feel obliged to demonstrate your brilliance now; just gently express what's most important to you once you're satisfied with the results of your inner process."
aries,2015-06-18,"Your attraction to someone special makes it difficult to express your desires because you're afraid of being rejected. You could grow overly concerned that your needs aren't supported by the current dynamics, leading you to bury your worries. However, pretending that everything is copacetic won't work in your favor since it will be quite apparent that you are holding something back. Ultimately, it's not what you choose to share that's problematic now; it's how you deliver the message that counts."
taurus,2015-06-18,"You're drawn to a rebellious person who pushes against your boundaries today, but you're cautious about acting out your feelings. You might believe you shouldn't step outside your comfort zone and therefore you may deny your unconventional attractions. Don't try to rationalize your desires; you don't have to justify your personal tastes to anyone. It's time to live your own life now without worrying about the expectations of others. Follow your heart and don't look back."
gemini,2015-06-18,"Your antennas are raised and you're scanning reality for something exciting to do but it's time to act responsibly if you want to achieve tangible results. You won't be satisfied for long if you just run off to the next event, so stop and face the music now. Ironically, your fears are probably more challenging than anything that actually happens. Sink into the messy realm of uncertainty today; navigating through emotional waters isn't your natural preference, but it's essential for your spiritual growth."
cancer,2015-06-18,"Differences of opinion in an intimate relationship continue to create unexpected ripples and today they might reach a critical point, leaving you with unresolved feelings. Your emotional sensitivity contributes to the turmoil, but losing your temper now seems like the only way to clear the air of unexpressed emotions. Nevertheless, a smarter strategy is to express your frustrations before they grow too potent. Sharing your concerns can help bring down your walls and fortify the love that's already in your life."
leo,2015-06-18,"An act of generosity reveals more than you intend today, especially if you're feeling more secretive than usual. Unfortunately, your magnanimous gesture won't likely express your true emotions now. However, you still might need to go through the motions whether you like it or not. Remember, once you have worked through your resistance, you should be able to reclaim your power by simply being true to yourself. The first person you need to be honest with is you."
virgo,2015-06-18,"You aren't the least bit interested in burdening any of your friends with your problems today. However, it's healthier to let them know the issues that have been on your mind, rather than keeping everything to yourself. Don't go searching for sympathy; just accept responsibility for your lot in life and keep working to manifest your dreams. Rather than dwelling on your fears, take the time to catch up with everyone before you let the negativity bring you down. Take comfort in the fact that others care enough to listen."
libra,2015-06-18,"Although you prefer being the cool-headed one that others can count on, you currently lack your usual objectivity. You wish you could hide your reactions, but you care so much about your work now that your emotions are quite obvious to everyone. Once you become aware of your vulnerable position, you might overcompensate by shutting down your feelings completely. However, this all-or-nothing approach won't lead to anyone's satisfaction today. Be courageous and show your concern for your fellow companions."
scorpio,2015-06-18,"Although your long-term goals are coming back into sharp focus now, the road to your future is being blocked by the past. Old fears may resurface today when you realize that nothing can change until you begin to shift your own attitude. Unfortunately, this realization might not be very reassuring, especially if you are preoccupied with the obstacles instead of your dreams. Keep the faith; the significant progress you have already made will continue to grow more evident over the weeks ahead."
sagittarius,2015-06-18,"Waves of uncertainty flow through your life today, reminding you to stop running around long enough to process your unresolved emotions. But you could worry that others will question your effectiveness if you're not performing miracles at work. Fortunately, you have not lost your edge; you're just experiencing a type of personal growth that doesn't mix well with your regular extroverted style. Don't let anyone else's judgments alter your trajectory. Breaking away for meditation and contemplation can be exactly what you need now to evolve to the next level."
capricorn,2015-06-18,"Your schedule doesn't necessarily allow the time for an emotional melodrama today, so you might try to keep your feelings out of the equation. Unfortunately, this unrealistic strategy could fall apart if someone inadvertently involves you in the same kind of drama you wish to avoid. You're ready to run; nevertheless, keep your heart and mind open to what you're being shown now rather than exhausting yourself resisting an important lesson. You might be surprised by what you learn if you stay put and ride out the storm."
aquarius,2015-06-18,"Your current optimism collides with reality today because you aren't ready to face a lingering issue head-on. The subjective Cancer Moon's visit to your 6th House of Employment challenges you to stay objective at work because you have specific opinions about almost everything. Encountering resistance from friends and coworkers can be demoralizing, but it also helps to clarify your thinking now. Thankfully, the truth dissipates your fears and frees you from worn-out patterns from the past."
pisces,2015-06-18,"You may be worried about the wisdom of a recent choice, but you're also hopeful that your life is on the upswing. Fortunately, you can be very patient now, even if your emotions are all over the place. Nevertheless, it's still impossible to tell if you're overreacting to the current situation or if the residual negativity you're feeling is actually real. For the sake of clarity, wait a few days prior to changing your game plan. In the meantime, visualize the most positive outcome instead of stressing about all the things you can't change."
aries,2015-06-19,"You wake up with a fresh outlook on life. It seems as if the dark clouds are lifting and you can see further off into the distance. It feels as if you should be setting long-term goals, but the childlike Leo Moon adds an element of playfulness to nearly everything you do. You're eager to face even the most challenging situations; just narrow your field of vision and proceed methodically as you turn your dreams into reality."
taurus,2015-06-19,"You might inadvertently reveal your innermost feelings in a rather nonchalant manner today. It often takes time for you to open up and verbalize your emotions, but the bighearted Leo Moon's presence in your 4th House of Roots makes self-disclosure seem like the simplest course of action. Grab this opportunity to share your dreams while you can, since expressing your hopes for the future sets an uplifting tone for the days ahead."
gemini,2015-06-19,"You may have so many things on your plate today that you feel weary before you even begin your first task. Although it's not easy to establish a sustainable pace, getting started is half the battle now. Don't waste precious time worrying about the possibility of letting someone down because you aren't sure you can hold up your end of the bargain. Just keep pushing forward; you could be happily surprised at the end of the day when you look back and see how much ground you actually covered."
cancer,2015-06-19,"Everything seems to be moving along smoothly now that your efforts are being acknowledged by your peers. But it's not a good idea to kick back and rest on past productivity as the lively Leo Moon energizes your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Even if your motives are more convoluted than others realize, your hard work is appreciated today. There's no reason to create drama around your hidden feelings. Simply express them without resistance when it's appropriate. Showing up authentically results in more harmony and acceptance than if you remain in your shell."
leo,2015-06-19,"Your intuition is running on overdrive while the receptive Moon brightens your 1st House of Self, but you're also excited by other people's unconventional plans. Your world is reverberating with unfamiliar tunes and you're eager to sing along. However, there's still a nagging voice encouraging you to play it safe now. Find ways to honor your vulnerability while still moving joyfully toward your future. Your tentative steps today will lead to a significant journey tomorrow."
virgo,2015-06-19,"You may be overwhelmed with all the new information that's recently come your way. Nevertheless, the conflicting data must be integrated into your current perspective, even if you think it will distract you from your real work. You might be so worried that you impulsively spill the beans without regard to the consequences. Nevertheless, there's no need to reveal your doubts today; a consistent and methodical approach will put you in good stead while you postpone major decisions for when you feel more grounded."
libra,2015-06-19,"Although there is an action-packed day in store for you, it feels as if something is preventing you from doing as much as you wish. It might even be that social obligations lure you away from fulfilling your job-related duties. However, if you remain focused on your responsibilities, the potential for enjoyment will likely resurface later in the day in ways that you don't expect. Count your blessings, for you excel at winning the balancing game that ultimately enables you to fit both work and play into your life."
scorpio,2015-06-19,"There's still more progress to be made when it comes to resolving issues of self-esteem, but you may experience a bit of a reprieve now. Three planets in expressive Leo are visiting your 10th House of Career and Public Life, bringing a new sense of optimism to your career path. You are cosmically empowered to take action and overcome self-doubt. Be patient, yet persistent. Don't  ease up on your efforts, but it is important to acknowledge that achieving results will take time. Just remember that your positive attitude today can work wonders in the long run."
sagittarius,2015-06-19,"Your optimism is building to a crescendo this weekend, yet you must be careful not to construct castles in the sky. If you over-commit your energy, you might end up wasting the current opportunities in front of you. Nevertheless, it's still tempting to blindly trust your instincts now; however, it's more practical to support your positive outlook with a concrete plan and the necessary follow-through. As Thomas Edison said, ""Invention is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."""
capricorn,2015-06-19,"You can tell that your energy is shifting along with the dynamics at work, but you might still resist the change. Accordingly, you may feel stressed as current circumstances require you to let go of familiar routines that bring you comfort. Although you're concerned that your actions will adversely affect others, you need to take a risk while the dramatic Leo Moon is dancing in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Observe your reactions closely today, especially while interacting with people who stir up your emotions. It's perfectly acceptable to switch the topic if things get too intense for your taste."
aquarius,2015-06-19,"Personal interactions with friends and associates  brings you a lot of joy today; however, there might be a price to pay. If you overextend your social calendar now, you might find yourself too tired to fulfill your obligations. Fortunately, you can turn moderation into a spiritual practice that has immediate practical benefits. Curtailing your activities enables you to conserve enough energy to feel content with both your personal and professional accomplishments at the end of the day."
pisces,2015-06-19,"You might feel like a hamster running in a wheel today, as you mull over the same ideas over and over. Your mental gymnastics may almost feel obsessive, but they also indicate that there could be a significant piece of information about a current project still missing from the picture. Nevertheless, continue to shine your inner light for all to see. Don't exert too much energy trying to find an elusive answer; just trust that it will all make sense in due time."
aries,2015-06-20,"Unsettled career questions make it tough to relax today, but at least the rush of adrenaline lets you know you are alive. Relationship dramas may weigh on your heart now, but openly expressing your intentions brings temporary relief. Unfortunately, the underlying issues won't be resolved so easily. Don't bother trying to tie up every feeling into a tidy package. Just maintain a positive attitude as you continue to reinvent your future. Remember, lasting change doesn't happen overnight."
taurus,2015-06-20,"Friends or family members may be overly critical of your plans while relentless Pluto leans on strict Saturn in your 7th House of Others. Your confidence is rattled today because you believe it's your fault if you fall short of someone's expectations. Although you might not receive the approval you want now, recognition could come later if you're willing to face your fears. Don't keep everyone at a distance so you can appear invincible. People are more likely to support you if you have the courage to be your authentic self."
gemini,2015-06-20,"Your inner turmoil could go unnoticed today because your current busyness keeps you distracted from the real issues at hand. Although you feel quite productive in your own way, you may still have trouble maintaining your focus for long. You can consciously concentrate on achieving the results you want or you can just fritter your time away by doing one trivial thing after another. You might be surprised with how much enjoyment you derive from channeling your passion into your work."
cancer,2015-06-20,"You're ready to swing into motion today, but you might be feeling a little lazy and don't want to move too quickly. Spending the morning in contemplation could be just what you need now so you can analyze the possible outcomes to each of your ambitious strategies. However, constructing a careful plan won't propel you to your desired destination by itself. Use the fixed and fiery Leo Moon's intent to initiate bold action that will lead to tangible results. Make the most of the cosmic momentum while you have the chance."
leo,2015-06-20,"Keeping your emotions secret is prudent from time to time, but now it's time to follow your natural inclination and share your desires with others. However, you can't indiscriminately express every single whim that pops into awareness, regardless of whom you happen to be talking to at the moment. Your personal life is your business, unless you choose to divulge your feelings to someone you trust. Thankfully, satisfaction is yours if you are judicious when it comes to revealing your heart."
virgo,2015-06-20,"Discussing your plans with a close friend provides a welcome sense of relief, but it's not wise to endlessly ramble on. The Moon's presence in your 12th House of Privacy raises issues about the conflict between discretion and honesty as you vacillate between telling others your true feelings and saying nothing at all. In the final analysis, all you can do is stay conscious of your words and stop talking before you diffuse your message. Consider your audience; if you run into any doubt, err on the side of caution."
libra,2015-06-20,"Your growing desire to be a part of a larger community motivates you to step out of your comfort zone to mix and mingle with the crowd. The Moon's trek through your 11th House of Social Networking invites you to be a more active participant in your group of friends and associates today. However, you must establish clear limits or you could be dragged into an unnecessary drama before you know it. Remember, your determination to hold your ground is what allows you to join in the fun without any emotional risk."
scorpio,2015-06-20,"You might be expected to set aside your weekend plans to help a friend in need. Even if you're committed to doing your part, you don't like it when others just assume that you will say yes. Instead of immediately offering to rearrange your schedule to jump into the project of the moment, share your concerns first. Once you place your position out on the table, you can negotiate a solution that is more comfortable for everyone involved. Working for the common cause is admirable as long as you don't lose yourself in the process."
sagittarius,2015-06-20,"You're even more outspoken than normal, espousing opinions on everything for everyone to hear. But people may be confused by your behavior because you're uplifting and inspirational one moment and overly resistant to new ideas the next. Instead of blurting out the first thing that crosses your mind, take a deep breath and let others know you need to clarify your thoughts before you share any conclusions. No one will fault you for your honesty; a little circumspection works wonders for your image."
capricorn,2015-06-20,"Deciding whether or not to disclose your intentions to someone you admire may be a real struggle today. Naturally, you want your feelings to be acknowledged, but you're also afraid of losing the support you already count on. Push through your fears and express your thoughts without expecting any particular response. The wisest way to prevent potential emotional distress is to remain unattached to the outcome. Opening your heart is mandatory if you want to give magic a chance to work."
aquarius,2015-06-20,"Slipping into a familiar relationship pattern is all-too tempting while the emotional Moon canoodles with benevolent Jupiter in your 7th House of Companions. Although Luna connects you with all that's gone by, there's no guarantee that a tried-and-true method will succeed while unpredictable Uranus is in the picture, too. Instead of reacting impulsively and running for shelter, consider the consequences before just playing it safe. Look forward to find your happiness in the future rather than wistfully gazing back at the past."
pisces,2015-06-20,"There's a small window of opportunity to upgrade your daily regimen if you're willing to use it. The Moon's current hook-up with propitious Jupiter in your 6th House of Health reminds you of the inarguable relationship between diet, exercise and your overall well-being. Even if you already eat organically and practice yoga, it's time to raise the ante and make minor improvements to your personal routine. It's always wise to cultivate more awareness and further enhance your lifestyle; even the tiniest adjustments now can have significant positive ramifications over the months to come."
aries,2015-06-21,"It's not fun when someone rejects your plans, but you might as well reserve your complaining for some other day. You won't likely receive a lot of support if an idea of yours can't stand up to fair criticism. Thankfully, the circumstances are not as dire as you think. Your contributions can have significant impact if you are willing to hear the tough truth now, learn an important lesson and step up your game as needed. The most successful people know there's always room for improvement."
taurus,2015-06-21,"Although you've been trying your best to simplify your life, you're still busier than you prefer. Luckily, today is a turning point and you can finally begin to regain control of your calendar. You have been running down a dream, but are now required to stop so you can concentrate on a single issue that demands your immediate attention. Fortunately, redirecting your thoughts away from fantasies and toward mundane considerations enables you to set aside extraneous distractions and produce measurable results."
gemini,2015-06-21,"You aren't interested in listening to the cool voice of reason today because it seems as if your current commitments prevent you from taking the most desirable path. Without an apparent way out of your present dilemma, you might have to get serious now about changing your schedule. Thankfully, you realize that your casual attitude can't make the very real problems disappear. The good news is that your determination to untangle a complicated dilemma could be enough to do the trick."
cancer,2015-06-21,"You've been happily immersed in your imagination, yet today your daydreams run into the cold, hard truths of reality. Unfortunately, you're not ready to leave your fantasies behind but the longer you avoid your obligations, the more of a challenge it will be to handle them in the long run. Starting your work now is smarter than procrastinating for one more day. Although your irrational feelings are running all over the map, they won't lead to satisfaction. Your logic is the key to finding your way back to your center of gravity."
leo,2015-06-21,"Reaching your long-term goals might feel like an impossible dream as you try to sort out where things stand in your life now. But there's little time for self-pity because you have important work to do today. Don't waste precious energy if you want to take advantage of the current window of opportunity. Make use of your legendary Leo zest for life as you make positive changes to your trajectory. When the going gets tough, the tough get going."
virgo,2015-06-21,"It seems as if you're being schooled today on a lesson you already know, making you feel a bit foolish in the process. But it's no one else's fault if you have a hard time accepting criticism. Thankfully, the Sun's shift into your 11th House of Long-Term Goals and the Moon's return to your sign can help take your mind off the present moment and aim your dreams toward the future. Make the necessary changes within yourself, without trying to change anyone else."
libra,2015-06-21,"Blind optimism morphs into enlightened realism today as your big ideas collide with a heavy dose of the truth. You might believe you only have two options. On one hand, your open-minded perspective is life-affirming; on the other hand, you can choose to shut down your heart in fear. However, there's a wide range of alternatives in the middle. The most important thing to do now is to make the most informed choices possible before moving on. Finding the sweet spot between the two extremes is your key to happiness."
scorpio,2015-06-21,"You long to have a deep conversation with a confidant today, but he or she might skillfully avoid talking about anything that's too unsettling. Or, perhaps you are the one who is cleverly engineering the conversation to prevent an uncomfortable topic from surfacing. Although the opportunity to discuss your feelings will continue to grow throughout the days ahead, don't let this chance to connect with someone you trust slip by. Burdens are lighter when shared with a friend."
sagittarius,2015-06-21,"Normally, you can see the positive side to nearly any situation. You are innately skillful at making just about everything sound better when you are trying to inspire others. Although you get a real kick out of banishing gray clouds from the sky, you still might have a difficult time today staying on the sunny side of the street. Nevertheless, it's imperative to maintain your most glorious vision of the future, for your optimism touches more people's lives than you realize."
capricorn,2015-06-21,"You face a complex dilemma today, for your success might appear to be in jeopardy as the Sun agitates your key planet Saturn. Your expectations are stymied by current limitations, making it hard to muster up the self-confidence you normally have at your disposal. Your natural reaction may be to circle the wagons now and anticipate the worst. However, your lack of control is only a temporary state of affairs. Your dedication, coupled with a positive outlook, should put you back in the saddle faster than you think."
aquarius,2015-06-21,"Although it's the weekend, your attitude about your job could turn a notch more serious while sobering Saturn forms an anxious alignment with the Sun in your 6th House of Employment. Spend time imagining new ways to sustain your recent gains by solidifying your professional relationships. If differences of opinion are at play, there's no need to force resolution. Instead of worrying about something you can't fix right away, focus on areas of your life where you can make progress today."
pisces,2015-06-21,"Disagreements with a lover or a playmate can be emotionally draining today, especially if your partner believes you're making a fuss over nothing. But you just want to be appreciated for who you are; your tender feelings may be wounded now if someone forgets to respect your wishes. Recognizing your needs is important, but resolving discord in a relationship still requires your commitment to meet the other person halfway. Making the first move might not be easy, but it's the quickest way to forgive and forget."
aries,2015-06-22,"Trivial facts can be annoying today, especially if they get in the way of your ambitious goals. However, you're in a hurry to produce results and could judge others harshly if they can't keep up with your accelerated pace. Naturally, practicing patience might alleviate tension before it even arises, but you just don't have the time to wait. You'll take the faster speed, along with the complications. Thankfully, the cosmos will reward your independent thinking now as long as you have a solid plan in place. Being a leader doesn't always mean the pack will follow."
taurus,2015-06-22,"You don't have a lot of bandwidth for frivolous activities today; however, a bit of fun isn't out of the question. You are ready to temporarily set your responsibilities aside, especially if you believe it's possible to learn something valuable from an extracurricular experience. Find out in advance how much time you need to allow for play so you can finish up your chores later on. It will be easier to escape with a clear conscience if you already have all of your bases covered."
gemini,2015-06-22,"You aren't necessarily the most meticulous worker in the world, yet you can move very quickly once you start a job. Unfortunately, you might put too much attention on the details if you are trying to impress someone today. But even with the very best of intentions, your work may not bring the emotional satisfaction you seek. Nevertheless, don't be too self-critical; just do the best you can at every turn. You may be quite pleased with how quickly your efforts bear fruit if you maintain a positive attitude."
cancer,2015-06-22,"You can accomplish more today if you prepare in advance instead of making everything up on the fly. Attending to your work commitments early allows you to have time to get in touch with your feelings. Meeting your obligations is honorable, but don't be so focused on the clock that you miss a truly wonderful chance to connect with your heart. Ultimately, it's not your worldly success that matters; it's the love you cultivate in your life that counts."
leo,2015-06-22,"You want to catch up on financial matters today while your mental acuity is sharp. However, the best application of your analytical skills isn't  to pay bills or balance your accounts. The current issues are more significant and affect nearly every aspect of your world. If you must make a choice about allocating funds now, use your resources in the most practical way possible. Avoid making quick assessments; instead, reflect on what's of most value to you before gambling with your future."
virgo,2015-06-22,"You might be uncomfortable with your irrational mood swings today while the emotional Moon visits your pragmatic sign. Avoid tasks that require high levels of concentration now, for you may not be able to prevent your mind from wandering. Even if you want to take the day off, you're unwilling to disappoint those who depend on you. However, scheduling short breaks throughout the day improves your ability to capitalize on the brilliant ideas that light up your mind."
libra,2015-06-22,"Containing yourself is nearly impossible today even if you're not quite ready to let others know your feelings. Ironically, keeping your emotions quiet now can heighten your spiritual awareness as long as you don't slip into denial about what's going on in your relationships. Don't succumb to external pressures; you'll know exactly when to act if you trust your intuition more than anyone else's advice. Listening to your heart is the most direct path to happiness."
scorpio,2015-06-22,"Socializing with your friends and coworkers in an unconventional setting offers the change of pace you seek today. But don't try to micromanage the situation and shift the energy to your advantage. Instead of wasting time by attempting to create a memorable event, just stay flexible; there's nothing to be gained now by trying to control the current dynamics. Ultimately, you have more fun and are more authentic when you are acting spontaneously, instead of working from a script."
sagittarius,2015-06-22,Unrealistic attempts to juggle one-too-many tasks today could lead to giving a poor performance across the board. Tread lightly in all of your interactions because understating your responses is the most efficient use of your energy now. Just take care of every problem in a calm and collected manner as soon as it pops up. Your confidence suddenly returns when others acknowledge how well you are handling a complicated situation. Reining in your enthusiasm just a little allows your competence to shine.
capricorn,2015-06-22,"Powerful forces are at work today, yet they may be lurking in the shadows, leaving you on edge. However, it's not your smartest move to accept the adage, ""out of sight, out of mind."" You might be tempted to overlook a minor detail now, but the tiniest thing could be the catalyst that turns your day around. Instead of jumping from one task to another, stick with each one until you are sure that the energy has run its course. Determination is your friend."
aquarius,2015-06-22,"There are numerous benefits to working in close collaboration with a partner now, whether you're starting a new endeavor or just running through your regular tasks. Someone might reveal important information that widens your perspective. However, you may be so quick to judge the contributions of others today that you shut them down before you hear what they have to say. Giving your peers a chance to express their ideas not only improves your work but also strengthens an important relationship in the process."
pisces,2015-06-22,"You may feel as if everything you do today doesn't quite meet other people's standards. But the fact of the matter is someone might be highly critical of your actions if he or she doesn't understand you or your behavior. Rather than responding as if you are a victim, carefully explain your intentions one more time. Even if you're heading back over familiar territory, it's still more advantageous to share your hurt feelings instead of hiding them. Initiating an honest dialogue provides an opportunity to clear the air once and for all."
aries,2015-06-23,"Conflicting cosmic instructions make it nearly impossible to please others today. One voice tells you to go while another commands you to stop. Macho Mars runs into Saturn's obstacles and there doesn't seem to be a way to get past the resistance. If you push too hard, you may wish you didn't. But if you don't try at all, you will wish you did. The only logical strategy now is to steer clear of extremes as you actively work the accelerator and the brake to stay within the speed limit."
taurus,2015-06-23,"You can grow very obstinate if you're manipulated in ways you don't like. It might feel as if everything is changing too fast today for your tastes, but clinging to the present is futile nonetheless. The more you attempt to hold your ground, the harder it is to get your footing in the midst of the storm. Don't try to fix everything; instead, find pleasure in the little things you can actually control. Luckily, the stress continues to lighten over the days ahead, so there's no point in fighting the inevitable when you can embrace the unknown."
gemini,2015-06-23,"You're reluctant to reveal your fantasies today because you worry that people will misunderstand you. Unfortunately, carrying around too many secrets could inadvertently invite a minor emotional meltdown. In the same way you can create walls by hiding your feelings, you can also remove the barriers by talking about your concerns with someone you trust. Relationship dynamics might not improve right away; in fact, things could get worse before they start to improve. Being honest sets the right tone while practicing patience leads to success."
cancer,2015-06-23,"Although you may be talking a mile a minute today, you still might not say exactly what you mean. People can tell that your chattiness is just one of your ways to cover up your insecurities. Fortunately, you're already on the edge of making an important breakthrough now, so don't waste time burying your emotions. The key to your current satisfaction is staying conscious of your process and allowing it to progress at its own natural rate. Don't worry about what to say next; when in doubt, simply bring your awareness back to your heart."
leo,2015-06-23,"You might think you're taking the most rational path today, but you could be under a false illusion that everything is fine. Unfortunately, something that was recently bothering you could suddenly erupt again unless you stay in close touch with your feelings now. However, your growing sense of urgency may not actually be a true reflection of the current circumstances. Don't wait for something crazy to happen; express your emotions before they get blown out of proportion. Being honest from the start prevents unnecessary drama from hijacking your day."
virgo,2015-06-23,"You might be so sure of your current actions that you miss the nuances of the political dynamics at work today. Unfortunately, you could set off an emotional landmine now that the moody Moon is traveling through your sign. It may feel as if someone is working at cross-purposes now, but it's more likely that your goals seem so different because you have such divergent approaches. Seek common ground in the present moment instead of trying to integrate your plans for the future into another person's dreams."
libra,2015-06-23,"It seems as if everyone has his or her particular idea of what you should be doing now, but no one is bothering to ask you what you want to do. This apparent disconnect is tricky territory to navigate, especially if you already feel alienated from those you love. Although people appreciate you trying to meet their demands, it may be more important to acknowledge your own needs first. There might not be a simple solution in sight, but you can minimize your frustration by shifting your attention away from your long-term goals and just live for the day."
scorpio,2015-06-23,"Instead of trying to convince anyone that your strategy is practical, examine your weaknesses so you can better understand how they lead you to overcompensate in your work. Rather than focusing on your own progress today, see what you can learn from others without trying to compete with them. When you're ready to jump back into the fray, remember that winning is less important than turning every moment into another chapter in your journey of self-discovery."
sagittarius,2015-06-23,"Although you're doing your best to demonstrate your good intentions, people still may not be satisfied with your efforts. You're feeling performance pressure now and it's disconcerting if you sincerely believe that others are working against you. However, there's absolutely no need to fight back; just continue gathering the facts and be ready to tell your side of the story when asked. In the meantime, rest assured that the only one you truly have to please is yourself."
capricorn,2015-06-23,"You're willing to endure hardship and austerity as long as you know that a big payoff might be yours in the near future. Your patience usually works in your favor, but now impulsive Mars is pushing for immediate results. Unfortunately, nothing is going to change overnight that will enable you to claim your reward any faster. Lessen your anxiety by temporarily suspending your need to speed up the process. You will arrive at your destination exactly on time if you confidently persevere in your efforts."
aquarius,2015-06-23,"You know exactly what you want but you have no idea how to get it. Don't worry if you're without a coherent strategy today; too much advanced planning only reduces your spontaneity. Unfortunately, some people may see you as uncooperative now, but that's not your intent; you just want to make your point as succinctly as possible. Once you make your case, you really don't have to try so hard to prove your loyalty or your competence. Ultimately, your actions will speak louder than your words."
pisces,2015-06-23,"You may be feeling your oats today, but possessing self-confidence doesn't necessarily mean your dreams will automatically come true. Part of your problem is that asking for the wrong thing now sets you up for failure before you even start. Thankfully, your sense of timing improves as the day wears on. What begins as a blunder could turn into a strong conviction to do the right thing. Following your moral compass enhances your chances for success."
aries,2015-06-24,"Your intensity is on the rise, yet you may feel moody and withdrawn today, filling you with contradictions. Unfortunately, you're bothered by the same things that wouldn't necessarily concern you on some other day. Additionally, you might grow annoyed with your own denial because you don't want to confront the source of the current irritation. Nevertheless, consciously facing an uncomfortable issue now is smarter than unconsciously losing your temper down the road."
taurus,2015-06-24,"Work is stressful these days, but you can't just stay home to avoid the tense dynamics. Although your heart might not be totally committed to what you're doing, you need to show up in a responsible manner. Even if you have doubts about your ability to deliver the goods, don't hold back just because you're feeling insecure in the moment. Go beyond the call of duty and put your best foot forward. The appreciation you receive will fuel your confidence, leaving you happy you made the extra effort."
gemini,2015-06-24,"You may experience a bit of an emotional letdown today as passionate Mars leaves your sign to float in the warm waters of Cancer. Although you might be afraid that you're going to miss all the action, nothing could be further from the truth. There is plenty for you to do if you focus on solidifying what you started over the past month. In the meantime, treat yourself to a gift of some quiet time for a change; after all, you need the rest so you will be fully prepared for the work ahead."
cancer,2015-06-24,"Happily, your confidence is irrepressible now, even if obstacles resurfaced this week to slow your progress. Luckily, superhero Mars shifts into your sign this morning, boosting your stamina and motivating you to start your latest version of your action plan. Although it's not your intention, you could run over someone else's agenda today without even realizing it. It's critical to find a proper outlet for your enterprising nature so you don't take your frustration out on a loved one. Channel your passion into your work."
leo,2015-06-24,"Your expressive personality has been working on overdrive and you may have spent too much time socializing without producing anything of lasting value. However, your needs are changing now that energetic Mars is hiding out in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Instead of dreaming about receiving recognition from your peers, you're fantasizing about running off to a monastery or at the very least, a remote tropical island. You relish the lack of performance pressure today. Enjoy your temporary invisibility while it lasts, for you'll be called back onto center stage soon enough."
virgo,2015-06-24,"You are known for taking your commitments very seriously, but it is best not to overdo it today. If your sense of loyalty to a friend stems from guilt, it's wise to keep your motives to yourself. Honesty is an admirable trait, but you really don't need to express everything all at once. Nothing will be gained by telling your whole story now except a colossal headache. Give others a chance to reflect on what you say before barraging them with another layer of complexity. Life isn't as complicated as you make it."
libra,2015-06-24,"Seeking balance is a never-ending struggle, but this search for harmony triggers a familiar conflict between home and career today. You might be inclined to take on more responsibility at work without sufficient energy to follow through on your ambitions. Or, maybe family obligations are tilting the scales away from your professional aspirations. No matter what's happening now, the Moon's return to your sign personalizes the current crisis. Luckily, with vigilant self-awareness your emotions won't bottle up and turn to resentment. Remaining transparent keeps everyone on the same page."
scorpio,2015-06-24,"Walking away from an emotional confrontation doesn't indicate that you aren't willing to fully experience your feelings. It's just that you believe your involvement won't add anything positive to an already complicated situation. The Moon's presence in your 12th House of Privacy delivers the message that sometimes keeping your reactions to yourself is the healthiest thing to do. Nevertheless, stay in touch with your desires, even if you choose not to share them today. Timing is everything."
sagittarius,2015-06-24,"You are often fun-loving, even cavalier, as you journey through life, so you may surprise others during this more introspective phase. Even if you're emotionally reserved now, don't shy away from acknowledging a difference in perspective if it will improve the current dynamics. Simply work through any conflict that arises today by adding a dash of self-deprecating humor. If you can muster up the courage to face your own sense of inadequacy, there's an excellent chance that your natural optimism will return soon enough."
capricorn,2015-06-24,"You're resigned to the fact that you have to put your shoulder to the wheel, but you're willing to do whatever it takes since the stakes are so high. However, you aren't necessarily ready to get started immediately, even if there is already a lot of work waiting for you. You might justify your current inaction by claiming you're reserving your energy for later on when you will need it. Go ahead and glide through the day if you want, but don't procrastinate for too long or you'll be sorry. Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today."
aquarius,2015-06-24,"There are such a limited number of options in front of you now that you could feel trapped by your own familiar patterns. Unfortunately, you may have sacrificed your independence for an emotional security that you're not even sure you want. Luckily, talking about your dilemma is the first step toward finding a solution. Even if nothing dramatically changes right away, you'll still feel better once the issues are out in the open. Everything will appear less daunting once seen in the light of day."
pisces,2015-06-24,"You might be angry with a friend or lover today, though it's challenging to say anything without making the situation worse. Although your conflicted emotions are playing out on the relationship stage, this dilemma is really about your inability to express your passion. You are likely irritated because your actions aren't truly representing your feelings. Fortunately, there's no need to resolve the differences between your inner and outer realities now. In fact, allowing them to temporarily coexist can be the source of great spiritual teachings if you're willing to do the work."
aries,2015-06-25,"It's tempting to take the demands of your job home with you today, but loved ones are quickly annoyed by your cranky mood if you do. Your attitude affects those around you more than you realize, so don't spread your negativity by bringing your problems home from work. You might feel as if you're on a collision course with reality now, yet you can avoid the crisis of impact by being more compassionate in your interactions. When in doubt, widen your perspective to include what others want, too. The needs of the many outweigh yours alone."
taurus,2015-06-25,"You wish you didn't feel so much pressure to accomplish your goals, but there aren't enough hours in the day to allow you to relax. You might try to finish your work, but you won't make much progress by doing the same old thing in the same old way today. Avoid slipping into a rut; if something doesn't rattle your cage early in the day, then take the initiative and step outside of the box on your own volition. Don't wait too long to shake things up if you want to create positive change."
gemini,2015-06-25,"You may regret bringing up a subject in a conversation today that has already been discussed one too many times. Even if you are uncharacteristically clinging to a past memory, it's apparent that others are ready to move on. Thankfully, if you just stop and think about how your reluctance to let go could trigger hurt feelings now, you can prevent an uncomfortable situation from turning into a more painful drama. Don't look back; walk through the door to your future with no regrets."
cancer,2015-06-25,"Although you strive to be fair-minded today, it's just as easy to go overboard with your opinions without even realizing your bias. You may perceive people as being more optimistic now than they actually are, tricking you into believing that everything is copacetic. But the real meaning of a current emotional exchange might be connected to someone's motives that are so subtle you miss the point. Do your best to listen to what's being said in between the spoken words so you can tune into the underlying message. Discovering the truth is the first step to enlightenment."
leo,2015-06-25,"A familiar relationship issue could resurface today when a close friend or relative says something hurtful that would have been harmless on any other day. Nevertheless, insensitive words may dredge up a difficult memory that you wish to avoid. Regain your emotional balance by distinguishing between old fears and what is occurring in the immediate moment. Keep in mind you're not in the same place as you were before and therefore don't need to suffer the same consequences. Treating those you love kindly in the present helps heal wounds of the past."
virgo,2015-06-25,"Sticking to the truth is exceptionally critical today, for your current tendency may be to transform an event into something more significant than it actually is. If you're not pleased with someone's behavior, communicate your dissatisfaction directly to the source. However, your message will be diluted if you don't stop talking once you've stated the facts. Above all, aim to keep everything as above board as possible. Your authenticity is key to creating meaningful relationships."
libra,2015-06-25,"Your vulnerability can complicate relationships as the reflective Moon meanders through your sign today. However, you might gloss over your insecurities by attempting to keep your interactions as detached and rational as possible. But taking an intellectual approach is not a wise strategy because Luna's presence tends to amplify your mood swings. Focusing on work now, rather than personal issues, can help to alleviate the emotional turmoil. However, don't miss this opportunity to connect with your own heart while you have the chance."
scorpio,2015-06-25,"Sometimes masking your true feelings is less complicated than telling the truth, especially while the Moon is drifting through your 12th House of Invisibility. You might encourage everyone else to share their vulnerabilities today, but this strategy is likely a smokescreen so that you don't have to disclose your own. It's easier to listen than to talk now, unless you are in the company of a trusted confidant. However, even if you're willing to open your heart, be careful about revealing all of your secrets too fast. There's a fine line between honesty and too much information."
sagittarius,2015-06-25,"You may add to the stress of the day by taking on more than you can handle. Thankfully, you're able to talk your way out of a difficult situation of your own creation, but it could leave you dissatisfied and feeling on edge, nonetheless. Unfortunately, working harder and accomplishing more won't solve your dilemma now. Instead of seeking additional distractions, just accept the assignment in front of you without question. Quality counts more than quantity today when it comes to cultivating peace of mind."
capricorn,2015-06-25,"You might believe you can power your way through the day by creating a detailed agenda to meet your obligations. Although you are usually quite adept at developing and executing plans, you may not see what's coming today as the Moon opposes unpredictable Uranus from your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Sadly, your day could quickly deteriorate into chaos if you adamantly try to maintain control. However, responding to any unforeseen changes with a light touch allows you to capitalize on the current instability. Flexibility is your secret key to success."
aquarius,2015-06-25,"You're quite determined to make your mark at work today but a series of emotional distractions can pull you off course. Unfortunately, your innate desire to be unique makes it harder to cooperate with others. Worry less about rebelling against the status quo and more about reaching your desired destination now. You could be so busy trying to demonstrate your independence that you forget what can be gained through artful compromise. Luckily, you don't have to lose your identity to be an integral part of the team."
pisces,2015-06-25,"Although you may buckle under pressure today, taking the nearest escape route isn't a viable option. Your penchant for slipping into your imagination could be overwhelmed by a simple twist of fate that spins you around and puts you on an unexpected course. Even if you can't avoid your real-world obligations, it's still tough to maintain a consistent level of productivity. Set aside your personal agenda for the day and simply put your heart and soul into meeting your current responsibilities. Work now, dream later."
aries,2015-06-26,"Your hasty reactions can create unnecessary problems today, especially if you don't respect people's boundaries. There are times when it's perfectly acceptable to push back against someone's resistance, but it must be done in a kind and thoughtful manner. Stop to consider if you may be stepping out of line now. Healthy relationships depend upon your ability to honor your partner's needs for personal space, especially when everyone's nerves are on edge. Do unto others as you would have others do unto you."
taurus,2015-06-26,"You may be so optimistic that you want to shout your plans from the rooftop as lovely Venus chases the positive reinforcement of joyful Jupiter. But anyone who actually takes the time to communicate with you soon realizes that you have given serious consideration to your current position. Others may be quite impressed by how practical your analysis is now, surprising you with their wholehearted support. Nevertheless, it's still wise to step through your plan one more time prior to taking action. No hurry, no worry."
gemini,2015-06-26,"Reality comes into focus today, yet it could take a few more days before both of your feet are back on solid ground. Nevertheless, you're tempted to take a casual social invitation and turn it into an excuse to start the weekend early. There's nothing wrong with trying to make a special moment last longer, but it's also crucial to pay attention to the cues you receive from others. Balancing your current desire to have fun with your drive to pursue a more serious agenda will offer you the best of both worlds."
cancer,2015-06-26,"Your inner world seems more spacious today, giving you enough room to contemplate your feelings without the judgmental restrictions of others. But this open atmosphere may be daunting if you choose to share your thoughts because you might not be able to determine when to stop. Thankfully, you can use your common sense to balance your need for connection with your desire to be alone. Keep your energy in check so you have reserves to draw on when you will need them most. Let your inner child out to play without worrying about the approval of anyone else."
leo,2015-06-26,"Although you might claim you're being very adaptable now, your long-term plans are more fixed than you realize. Even the simple act of sticking to your original agenda might bring more frustration than happiness today, especially if you pass up an interesting opportunity because of your lack of flexibility. Ultimately, it's about trusting the process; letting go of control could be the key that turns an uncomfortable situation into a positive one. Life is an adventure when you stay open to the element of surprise."
virgo,2015-06-26,"You're genuinely surprised by your powerful feelings today, but you still wish you could maintain a cool analytical approach to your goals. Your current subjectivity may overwhelm your senses, leading you to overcompensate by retreating into the safety of your logic. Although you're more comfortable relying on your thoughts rather than your emotions, shielding yourself from the uncertainties of your desires also lessens the joy they might bring to your life. Exploring your passions can be quite complicated, but it could transform your outlook in the most surprising way."
libra,2015-06-26,"Your mood continues to lift over the next few days, giving you plenty of reasons to celebrate. Naturally, you want to share your enthusiasm, but something still holds you back, preventing you from letting your hair down and having fun. Although it's crucial to live up to your promises and fulfill your responsibilities, it's also important to acknowledge that you have more to offer others in the long run if you take some time to enjoy yourself today. Life is short; kick up your heels while you can."
scorpio,2015-06-26,"You aren't sure whether to feel happy or sad today because each new opportunity also presents a potential obstacle. Although the emotional Moon's return to your sign provokes wide mood swings, you still should be able to work within the limits of nearly any situation now as long as you don't automatically expect something for nothing. Be willing to do the serious thinking and heavy lifting required to make the most of the present moment. Your passionate perseverance serves you well."
sagittarius,2015-06-26,"Much of your current experience is hidden from your friends and colleagues, although they may believe they know what you're feeling. Fortunately, you can appreciate the wisdom of discretion now, even while buoyant Jupiter encourages you to put on a dramatic show of love and support for those you respect. Don't feel obliged to express your deepest thoughts to anyone today; being a cheerleader for others enables you to forget about your own worries for a while. Acting unselfishly can be its own sweet reward."
capricorn,2015-06-26,"You aren't thrilled about having to deal with someone you think isn't being honest with you. You can intuitively sense when others are hiding their feelings but confrontation doesn't work in your favor today; they will only get defensive and slip further into denial. Your current lesson is to learn how to live without having all the answers. You will probably hear the rest of the story in a few days, so be patient and take comfort in knowing that you will discover the truth in time. All you can really do now is let your friends know you're there to listen when they are ready to talk."
aquarius,2015-06-26,"You appreciate the positive vibes coming your way today because it seems as if others are encouraging you to follow your dreams. Nevertheless, you can't put your finger on a subtle something that doesn't feel quite right. Unfortunately, you grow frustrated if you struggle to uncover what you don't know, especially because you might not be missing anything at all. The good news is your free-floating sense of doubt will pass if you don't blow it out of proportion. In the meantime, accept any support you receive with grace and gratitude."
pisces,2015-06-26,"Your visions seem so real now that it's nearly impossible to distinguish them from your mundane world. Fortunately, the juxtaposition of fact and fantasy is familiar territory for you imaginative Fish. Although dream catching is usually tricky business, you have a rare opportunity to create your future as you wish it to be. Conjuring up your ideal scenario in your mind is not an act of denial today; it's an act of magic that's strong enough to change the course of current events."
aries,2015-06-27,"You can override your wariness of uncomfortable emotional interactions today as long as you trust the wisdom of the universe. You intuitively know that your fear of losing control currently stands between you and the intimacy you would like to create. But you can't use reason to push past your concerns now. Although you might not be able to shut off the endless flow of self-doubting words, listen to your heart instead of your head. Be courageous and take a leap of faith for love."
taurus,2015-06-27,"People seem to enter your life today to intensify whatever you are already feeling. You may be resistant to their support, especially if you think they might take over by relentlessly offering their advice and subtly shifting your trajectory. Nevertheless, there's no need to overreact and turn a harmless situation into a unnecessary conflict. The more open-minded you are now, the wider the range of possibilities that stretch out before you. Don't shut down; even if your methods are different, your long-range goals are likely the same."
gemini,2015-06-27,"Just when you thought clarity was yours for the asking, the soft focus lens slides back into place to blur your perceptions. The good news is that your current fuzziness forces you to rely more heavily on your intuition as you fill in the missing details from the far reaches of your imagination. Let go of your need to intellectually know all the answers; magic can only occur if you're willing to play in the field of dreams."
cancer,2015-06-27,"You often pull back into your shell when you're feeling insecure because creating boundaries gives you the illusion of safety. However, something is different these days; you're more likely to reach out to others instead of withdrawing away from them. You can instinctively tell the difference between friend and foe now that the watery Scorpio Moon is harmonizing with psychic Neptune. Follow your intuition; it will lead you in the right direction. Just remember not to go too far out on a limb since the emotional tides will change again soon enough and you'll be back on dry ground."
leo,2015-06-27,"It's becoming more obvious day by day that you are floating along in a positive flow and there's no reason to fight against the current. Your lingering resistance may offer clues to old patterns that are still impeding your progress. However, you'll only encounter frustration by concentrating on the obstacles. Ironically, the harder you try to eliminate a roadblock, the larger it looms. A radical strategy is required now: focus on your destination rather than what stands in the way. You could be happily surprised as the road ahead mysteriously opens up and your way is cleared."
virgo,2015-06-27,"You understand exactly what you need to do today even if you don't have every minute mapped out in great detail. Normally, you might feel uneasy knowing that all the pieces of the puzzle don't fit but you're good to go now, even with so many loose ends still dangling. Thankfully, the cosmic forces are working a bit of magic on your behalf.. Just keep reining in your current tendency to over-expand and over-indulge; moderation will keep you on the path to success while giving you enough time to figure things out along the way."
libra,2015-06-27,"You might nostalgically long for the good old days of cool objectivity, even if exciting opportunities are unfolding on the social front. Whether your calendar is suddenly booked or a relationship is taking an unexpected turn, your emotions are powerful right now and this intensity can be quite bothersome. You may be happy about the opportunities but not as pleased with your apparent loss of control. Although maintaining a healthy perspective can be challenging today, you stand to reap the greatest rewards if you temporarily surrender to your feelings without worrying where they will lead."
scorpio,2015-06-27,"You have no idea what to expect next, especially if you recently experienced a break in your regular routine. Fortunately, it's not necessary to have your entire schedule set in stone; the more flexible you are now, the greater your progress. However comfortable the past may be, clinging to it will only bring disappointment. The universe is conspiring to give you a free upgrade if you let it. Change isn't easy if you allow your fears to tether you to the past. Nevertheless, the future is looking brighter than ever; all you have to do is accept its invitation to dance."
sagittarius,2015-06-27,"Your dreams hold the key to your happiness now, whether or not you actually manifest them. In fact, letting your creativity loose to imagine all the possibilities ahead acts as a spiritual practice today. Explore each item on  your bucket list even if it's not practical or feasible in the real world. Something valuable will emerge from your fantasies if you give yourself permission to believe they can come true."
capricorn,2015-06-27,"Although you don't often step outside of the practical realms, you have a hunch about your destiny that can't be rationalized today. Luckily, your psychic powers are strong now and you're probably picking up signals from a potential future reality. Don't make the mistake of ignoring your current perceptions just because they don't make sense. Instead, delve into your unexpressed daydreams without too many expectations. The cosmic messages are meant for your spiritual growth."
aquarius,2015-06-27,"People gravitate to you today because your sunny disposition makes them feel special. It's not that your optimism is unrealistic; it's just that you seem to have the Midas touch today and everyone who steps into your world gets treated as if they are gold. Luckily, spreading your good will won't cost you a penny. In fact, the universe is like a mirror now and every positive vibe you send out comes back in multiple blessings. Invest in your happiness by sharing it with others."
pisces,2015-06-27,"Rather than idly fantasizing about an upcoming adventure, it's time to put your thoughts into decisive action. But you don't have to build Rome in a day; you only have to take baby steps toward your ultimate goal. Ignore any lingering negativity or self-doubt and just imagine how happy you can be if you start living your dreams right now. Although you might not think anyone is watching, your efforts won't go unnoticed. Don't worry about measuring your progress; influencing your destiny is easy if you try."
aries,2015-06-28,"When you stand still long enough to explore beneath the surface, emotional issues take on a life of their own. You typically don't go out of your way to find these places where you feel vulnerable because you prefer dealing with problems you can solve quickly. Nevertheless, there isn't anything that must be fixed now. Acknowledging your penchant to cut loose when things get too deep helps you stay present with your dilemma. As the Beatles sang, ""Oh that magic feeling, nowhere to go."""
taurus,2015-06-28,"Your embarrassment may be difficult to hide if someone becomes overly emotional today and reveals a previously well-kept secret. You might prefer to avoid drama completely, but the conversation could begin suddenly and deepen too quickly to stop. You seek simple pleasures, but nothing you try seems to reduce the complications that stem from sharing a heart connection. Letting go of your assumptions about relationships can be liberating to all involved."
gemini,2015-06-28,"It's time to try a new communication tactic that involves remaining silent. Unfortunately, being quiet doesn't come naturally to you and today is no exception. You're tempted to talk your way around the real issue. Nevertheless, the more you say, the more turbulent your interactions, since your expressed desires could run into unexpected resistance. There's no need to turn your frustrations loose on anyone else. Although negatively only grows now if you feed it, the same can be said of love."
cancer,2015-06-28,"You're more contemplative now that the Sun and Mars are sparring in your moody sign, making you less likely to act on your feelings. Even if you are confident that your perceptions are accurate, you might not want to place yourself in the vulnerable position of chasing your heart's desires for fear of being rejected. Don't force anything unless you are completely at ease with whatever happens. However, accepting your current fate without ill will empowers you to live free from worry. Love flourishes when there are no expectations attached."
leo,2015-06-28,"Asking for something you want now is significantly more complicated than just pretending you're happy. Of course, hiding your feelings diminishes your chances of finding satisfaction. However, there's no urgency to say anything now. Removing the need for immediate gratification allows you to effortlessly reach a deeper level of intimacy with someone special. It's a relief to recognize the fact that you don't always have to put on a show to impress the ones you love."
virgo,2015-06-28,"Although you might be more confident about expressing your feelings today, people won't automatically applaud what you have to say. You are very particular when choosing your words, yet your need for accuracy won't slow you down. Still, your willingness to step into unfamiliar emotional territory could feel threatening to someone close to you. There's no reason to keep any secrets yet being conscious of your delivery can make a delicate conversation go your way. However, it's the total presentation package that really counts; consider your audience and think before you speak."
libra,2015-06-28,"You are edging toward taking a risk in the realm of love and romance, but you may not have the right words to make your point. You might think you know your ultimate destination, but domineering Pluto has its own agenda. Resistance is futile; you must let go of goals that are based upon selfish needs and replace them with a more altruistic path. Don't view the current predicament as any form of defeat; focus on the good you can do for others instead. The more you exercise your heart muscle, the stronger it grows."
scorpio,2015-06-28,"Your ability to concentrate is diminished while the evocative Moon is back in your sign, heightening your passions. It's impossible to know exactly what you want as your feelings ebb and flow throughout the day. No matter how much you try to balance your current craving for independence with the emotional security of a relationship, something essential is still lacking. Hang tight and journal about your internal process instead of talking about it. The energy shifts as soon as tomorrow, clarifying your desires and clearing your path. Unraveling the mysteries of your heart takes time."
sagittarius,2015-06-28,"Keeping conversations light and easy today is an ongoing challenge. However, you could be lured into an emotionally intense discussion that raises eyebrows and shines a light on issues about who is in charge. You might have acquiesced in a recent struggle, but now you need to reclaim some of your lost power. Nevertheless, avoid doing battle with anyone close to you. Raise the stakes by simply doing what's ethically correct without worrying about anyone else. Lead by example and see who follows."
capricorn,2015-06-28,"Complex relationship issues can throw you off balance, yet your current attempt to regain your composure is a healthy sign. Although you might think it's time to put your life back in order, it's not as simple as it sounds. Cooperating with others and acknowledging their divergent desires complicates your day, but you won't be able to proceed without emotional support now. Take it slowly and give everyone involved, including yourself, plenty of time to adjust to the new landscape. Transformation is a gradual process."
aquarius,2015-06-28,"A disquieting juxtaposition between knowing what you want and doing what's expected can tilt your day into the twilight zone. You might not fully understand what your current actions have to do with your life path, especially if you try to intellectualize every interaction today. Luckily, relinquishing your need to have all the answers immediately should loosen things up significantly. Forget about logical analysis; just follow your instincts now and trust that the cosmos will guide you in the right direction."
pisces,2015-06-28,"You have a narrowly defined agenda today, yet it's challenging to convince anyone to join your cause especially when you set your needs above those of everyone else. However, just staying aware of what makes you happy throughout the day could be enough to turn the tables in your favor. Avoiding extreme situations where everything or nothing goes your way is a wise strategy which can ease your anxiety. Steering toward the middle of the road now helps you circumvent the obstacles on both sides."
aries,2015-06-29,"You might not be all that concerned about your future emotional security because your personal relationships appear to be growing stronger. You may be so confident that you think you can have it all now. However, it's one thing to indulge in fantasies that carry you into new territory; it's quite a different thing to share your out-of-the-box desires with someone who could feel threatened by them. Thankfully, there's a lot of room to spread your wings without jeopardizing an arrangement that already works. A dash of consideration saves the day."
taurus,2015-06-29,"You may naively fix on the belief that everything will turn out wonderfully, prompting you to let some important business slide today. You can create a positive impact on your life by the simple act of knowing your dreams will come true. Nevertheless, you still must observe limits or you will face unpleasant consequences. There's a lot at stake now, so don't bet your success on faulty assumptions of a brighter future. Apply yourself diligently in the present moment to slant the odds in your favor. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
gemini,2015-06-29,"A shift in relationship dynamics might be cause for concern, but your worry fades when you see that the dark clouds actually have silver linings. It's reassuring once you realize that whatever is stuck will finally move on, making room for positive change. Although you can't predict the details of your future, you just know it's a big improvement over what's going on now. It's not necessary to finalize your plans yet; it's better to live with the uncertainty while you continue to explore all the options in front of you."
cancer,2015-06-29,"You're not willing to sacrifice your values just to be accepted by your peers, but you also want to accomplish your goals on time. Fortunately, you can create heartfelt connections with your coworkers today, even if your objectives are different from theirs. You don't have to negate what's most important to you as long as you are appreciative of what others bring to the table. Happily, you can have your cake and eat it too if you remember to practice the art of inclusion."
leo,2015-06-29,"You're thrilled with the unlimited potential you see everywhere you look today. However, you can't turn every single contender into a winner, even if sexy Venus is flirting with shocking Uranus. Keep in mind, you won't be able to sustain your current enthusiasm forever, so conserve your resources and work to make an opportunity pay off while the planets are in a playful mood. All that glitters is not gold; the choices you make now really do matter."
virgo,2015-06-29,"You're buzzing with anticipation today, for you recognize how each individual moment holds precious seeds for fantastic things to come. Unfortunately, events are occurring so rapidly that they might trigger your anxiety, even if the opportunity for growth is very exhilarating. Of course, you prefer to be happy, but you may be scared that the positive vibrations won't last. You can ensure a more successful outcome by building slowly and methodically on a strong foundation. Just remember, you reap what you sow."
libra,2015-06-29,"An unexpected opportunity comes as a total surprise today, so put away your previous agenda and be on the lookout for something amazing to happen. Instead of approaching life in your safe and familiar manner, leave the beaten path and try walking on the wild side. Habitual patterns are comforting, but they also limit your options. Acting spontaneously now could lead to a truly memorable experience that takes you farther than you can imagine. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
scorpio,2015-06-29,"An out-of-the-blue event can turn your day upside down. Even if you intended on spending a quiet day at work, a situation could grow out of hand quickly. But a simple twist of fate may be just what the doctor ordered to set you off in an entirely new direction. Don't try to second guess your destiny when the universe is giving you an opportunity to actualize your potential. However, if you fearfully attempt to return to the way things were, you could miss out on a lot of fun. Feel the joy and success will follow."
sagittarius,2015-06-29,"Your whole life seems to be undergoing rapid change. Ironically, you may be elated riding the currents wherever they take you, even if you haven't the slightest notion of where you are going. Your positive attitude is an asset as you head out on this great adventure, but don't assume that you're ready to leave just because the cosmos is giving you the green light. Taking your time to put everything in order now greatly improves your chances of actually reaching your destination in style."
capricorn,2015-06-29,"You might think that offering no resistance today means you will be required to use your emergency brake later on to avoid a disaster. You may believe that the only way to maintain control of your personal life now is to slow down and narrow your focus. Unfortunately, conservative tactics won't likely bring you the stability you seek. Additionally, letting your fears influence your decisions is a big mistake and could sour a perfectly lovely situation. Luckily, if you go with the flow you'll glide through the twists and turns with a little help from your planetary friends."
aquarius,2015-06-29,"You are looking good today and probably feeling even better. Vivacious Venus is harmonizing with your key planet Uranus, conjuring up plenty of excitement. For now, you're the one who's capable of safely navigating the surprising landscape, so others may lean on you for advice and leadership. Don't take the easy way out by giving them the party line. Your friends and coworkers might not want to hear the truth, but your unique insight is more valuable in the long run. There's no reason to limit the potential of your visions. Anything can happen if you simply believe."
pisces,2015-06-29,"You are wired with positive thoughts and are raring to charge forward. However, things get tricky because you might not have any clue which direction you are going yet. You know your destination is not a familiar place, which makes you happy now because you are craving new experiences. Thankfully, your optimism is soaring and you have no doubt you will reach the stars if you could only decide on the path you want to take. Catch your breath and reconsider your priorities before you find yourself drifting aimlessly out to sea. Advanced planning is the ticket to your success."
aries,2015-06-30,"Magical plans are on your drawing table and the more you think about them, the bigger they become. You can't help but be excited about the prospects of an upcoming event, but you need to be careful, nonetheless. It's possible to invest so much energy into your ambitions that you can't live up to your own expectations, even if all goes according to your plans. Dream large but don't be disappointed if reality falls short of perfection. If you aim for the stars, there's no shame in only reaching the Moon."
taurus,2015-06-30,"Intense feelings continue to rumble and stir from the hidden depths of your subconscious. Luckily, your inspiration knows no bounds now and there's no reason to stifle your creativity any longer. You can successfully go further than you realize as long as you don't let the past define your future. Your current restlessness with the status quo encourages you to say yes, even if you're not sure you understand the question. The universe is very generous today; all you have to do is follow your intuition to get the right answer."
gemini,2015-06-30,"A friend or lover may tempt you to go for broke today, but you shouldn't agree to anything that isn't consistent with your desires. Instead of trying to please everyone else now, make sure you know exactly what you want when it comes to relationships. Otherwise, you might spend the day chasing your tail without hope of ever finding real satisfaction. However, if your actions are aligned with your heart, there's little that can stand in your way when there's so much cosmic electricity in the atmosphere."
cancer,2015-06-30,"Thinking small is not part of your strategy today because nearly every one of your good ideas falls under the spell of your magnifying lens. The Moon's trine to inflationary Jupiter from your 6th House of Work prompts you to turn every little task into a major production. However, your uncharacteristic attraction to adrenaline can make your life more complicated. But paring back your plans won't necessarily bring you emotional satisfaction now. Increased complexity is a small price to pay for happiness."
leo,2015-06-30,"You're in such a playful mood today that it's quite possible romance is on your mind. No matter your current relationship status, you're likely to get a lot of mileage out of the sexy connection between the provocative Moon, magnetic Venus and electric Uranus. Creativity can lead you into magical territory now as long as you don't resist the impulse to experiment with an entirely new approach to love. Your next adventure, if you're willing to accept it, is the exploration of the corners of your heart."
virgo,2015-06-30,"A sudden bolt of urgency might catch you off guard today, especially if you feel pressured to act on your feelings. It's more natural for you to stop to analyze all the options; however, there's no time for rational thinking now. Paradoxically, the faster you react, the more successful your efforts. Don't worry about getting it right on the first try. It may take several attempts to reach your goal but you'll still get there sooner than you expect. Practice makes perfect."
libra,2015-06-30,"Your ingenious ideas empower you to convince others to collaborate with you to make your dreams come true. Unfortunately, if you take on a project that's too ambitious, you may run into trouble before you even know it. If you skip over important details today, they will quickly come back to haunt you. Luckily, your current progress is likely as long as you keep your goals in a healthy perspective. Scaling back your promises before you even make them is better than disappointing others down the road. Ironically, you can reach new heights of creativity as long as you remember to keep your feet on the ground."
scorpio,2015-06-30,"Your high hopes around money issues are inspiring, but there are significant details that must be handled before you can materialize your dreams. Luckily, nothing insurmountable prevents you from reaching your highest potential now; the biggest obstacle remaining is you. When you accept the fact that you can do anything if you exert the right amount of energy, you can make the smartest choices about what's truly worthwhile. Choosing wisely is half the battle; following through is the other."
sagittarius,2015-06-30,"Your confident attitude continues to earn you more freedom at home and at work. But you could take your current optimism too far, inadvertently turning yourself into a caricature and inviting ridicule from those who know you best. Overstating your case is a tactic that will surely backfire, so aim for a balanced approach. Don't be afraid of letting others know your feelings, but don't go overboard and try to convince them you are right. Just express what's in your heart and then let your bold actions speak for themselves. Sincerity is your friend."
capricorn,2015-06-30,"You might believe you have something significant to hide while the Moon haunts your 12th House of Secrets. In spite of your stealth behavior now, your behavior is more revealing than you think. You can make matters worse if you assume everyone else yearns for the same things as you. The truth is that your eyes are bigger than your stomach today; you want more than you need. Avoid making any long-term decisions while your desires are out of whack because you will return to your sensible self in a few days. In the meantime, allow your colorful imagination to run free and enjoy the show."
aquarius,2015-06-30,"Hanging out with your friends sounds like a lot more fun than showing up and doing your job. However, growing resentful of your responsibilities won't make you any happier or result in much productivity, either. Thankfully, you have a bit of magic up your sleeves today and you can turn your chores into a party without losing a beat. Meeting your responsibilities isn't nearly as problematic as it seems at first. Work like a grownup and play like a kid, all at the very same time."
pisces,2015-06-30,"Focus your full attention on your career today as the auspicious Grand Trine highlights your houses of work and money. Taking care of business is about the here and now, even if the consequences of your actions could take some time yet to bear fruit. Nevertheless, it's wise to reserve some of your energy to visualize where you want to be in the future. You may be impatient, but trying to rush success isn't helpful in the long run. Defining your goals is the first step to manifesting them."
aries,2015-07-01,"Although your heart is drawn toward your family life, today's Capricorn Full Moon highlights your 10th House of Career. You might feel as if everyone is depending on you at work and you don't want to let anyone down. Meanwhile, those you love at home also require your undivided attention. Luckily, your newly found spiritual approach to problems enables you to advance professionally while still attending to your emotional needs. It's impossible to go wrong if you keep a firm grip on your integrity."
taurus,2015-07-01,"Although you have thought long and hard about your goals, insecurities may kick in now, causing you to doubt yourself all over again. The hardworking Capricorn Full Moon brightens your 9th House of Big Ideas, complicating your goals for the future. Keep an open mind about your plans, even if you attempt to stick to your current agenda. Fortunately, you can dream your way right around any roadblocks today, real or imagined. Extending your imagination into the vast realm of possibilities is a powerful way to expand your horizons."
gemini,2015-07-01,"It might seem prudent to exercise self-control today, but narrowing your focus won't prevent your emotions from influencing your decisions. Your thinking is out of whack while the ambitious Capricorn Full Moon illuminates your 8th House of Intimacy, yet your feelings are revealing something significant about a current relationship. You could waste endless energy trying to find the logical in an illogical situation. Follow your heart now; you may need to throw caution to the wind before you can sprout wings and fly."
cancer,2015-07-01,"Your unacknowledged needs come precariously close to the shores of awareness, impacting your most important relationships. The earthy Capricorn Full Moon in your 7th House of Partners pulls directly opposite the watery Cancer Sun, stirring tidal forces from the depths of your subconscious. Luckily, you can create a safe harbor in your imagination that allows you to share your dreams and fears without worry. Rather than isolating yourself, consciously move closer to those who will support you through times of change."
leo,2015-07-01,"Pressing responsibilities may stymie your attempts to dive into the luxurious and nurturing backwaters of your own fantasies. The Capricorn Full Moon shines in your 6th House of Habits, encouraging you to stick to your daily routine in spite of your desire to while away the time daydreaming. Ironically, you will feel more emotionally satisfied if you have something tangible to show for your efforts today. Just don't get so swept up in a whirlwind of productivity that you forget to honor your unexpressed dreams, too."
virgo,2015-07-01,"Suppressing your feelings isn't anything new to you since you understand the impracticality of emotions. Today's goal-oriented Capricorn Full Moon spotlights your 5th House of Self-Expression, urging you to exercise good judgment if you want to reach your desired destination. But self-restraint isn't always your most effective strategy. Push past your tendency to separate yourself from others by inquiring about their hopes and dreams. You may be pleasantly surprised by how easily a conversation unfolds once the words start flowing. Sharing your heart is the fastest way to true intimacy."
libra,2015-07-01,"You could anticipate the future with such enthusiasm that you miss the most important piece of the puzzle today. Although you want to take advantage of the opportunities in front of you, the serious Capricorn Full Moon impacts your 4th House of Roots, anchoring your feelings to the past. You can imagine the amazing potential but still have a tough time making room for new plans. The key to resolving your current conflict is not about doing anything in the real world; it's about changing your frame of reference. Sometimes living in the present moment is enough."
scorpio,2015-07-01,"Taking an extreme all-or-nothing approach to fulfilling your needs can turn love into a complicated jumble of feelings. It's not easy to stay comfortable in the middle of the emotional spectrum, especially when your fantasies are so vivid. Nevertheless, the calculating Capricorn Full Moon casts its light in your 3rd House of Communication, prompting you to consider the consequences of your message before telling anyone what's on your mind. Establishing a healthy balance between expression and restraint may be enough to put you on the path to relationship success."
sagittarius,2015-07-01,"You might be concerned today if you don't see an easy way to balance your income with your expenditures. Separating your financial worries from deeper issues about self-worth isn't only a matter of numbers, especially while the responsible Capricorn Moon accentuates your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Instead of misdirecting your attention to what's lacking in your life, concentrate on all the positive growth. Counting your blessings is a simple yet magical way to raise your self-esteem and, surprisingly, also your bottom line."
capricorn,2015-07-01,"Your strength is being tested today as you ride the powerful emotional waves of the Capricorn Full Moon. Your life is even more complicated with surreal Neptune's presence making it nearly impossible to separate reality from fantasy now. Balancing your feelings with the demands of the outer world is both challenging and invigorating. However, committing to a path of resistance will eventually exhaust you. Instead, dig deep and find the courage to push away from the safety of familiar territory. There's so much to gain if you let go of your need for certainty and embrace the unknown."
aquarius,2015-07-01,"Sneaking away for some personal time could become your obsession while the Capricorn Full Moon lights up your 12th House of Escape. Unfortunately, current obligations may still require you to adhere to your regular routine today. But don't work yourself into a state of anxiety trying to complete everything now. Just do whatever is feasible while allowing time for short breaks throughout the day. Ultimately, the most strategic practice is to continue seeking the right balance between responsibility and recreation."
pisces,2015-07-01,"Your commitments seem all-consuming but you also recognize your need to rest. The steady Capricorn Moon recharges your 11th House of Social Networking, offering you the opportunity to enjoy the camaraderie of friends and relatives. But you must stay vigilant and keep things in proper perspective while nebulous Neptune is also floating around in the picture. Swimming in your imagination can be tricky business when you don't know which side of the truth you are on."
aries,2015-07-02,"You have plenty to accomplish today and not enough time to do it all. Unfortunately, it may take a lot to motivate you if you would rather be enjoying the lazy days of summer. Nevertheless, you will be happier by the end of the day if you don't say yes to the first social invitation that pops up. Start your work engine and shift into gear; the more you finish early in the day, the more freedom you'll enjoy later on. It's vastly more satisfying to play when your conscience is clear."
taurus,2015-07-02,"There's electricity crackling in the air today and, luckily, you might not have to go far to enjoy the experience. In fact, if you must head out into the world you'll want to plug back into the relaxation and fun that awaits you when you return. Whether or not your home is where your heart is, you won't be able to fully relax unless you're feeling emotionally secure. Connecting with the magic around you is more likely once you're connected with your own heart."
gemini,2015-07-02,"Your charm and cleverness are operating so efficiently today that you could talk your way into getting nearly anything you want. However, tread carefully because there's more going on than meets the eye and your words have the potential to unleash deeper issues. Happy days may be here again, but don't get so captivated by the possible sensual delights that you forget about the more mundane things that require your  immediate attention. Use your powers of persuasion for the greater good."
cancer,2015-07-02,"Your mind is running a mile a minute now, but no one seems to know what's going on in your head. However, the speed of your thoughts may be impacting your clarity without you realizing it. Although your self-confidence is on the rise, it actually helps if you don't talk about every little thing that is bothering you. Instead, give yourself permission to pursue the activities that make your heart sing. As you express your energy in a positive manner, your joy will ripple out and reverberate through the lives of others."
leo,2015-07-02,"Life seems to be settling down now and the stress is finally dissipating. You're eager to see the hectic energy pass, but you're not looking for too much peace and quiet, either. Perhaps William Blake was incorrect when he claimed, ""The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom."" Take advantage of a viable opportunity that lands at your feet today, but don't inflate a good idea into one that you believe will surely save the world. As soon as your thinking grows out of hand, you'll have a harder time reaching your goals. Moderation is your friend."
virgo,2015-07-02,"Satisfying your romantic urges can be tricky business if you're not willing to reveal your vulnerability. Although your desires are intense today, you might not know how to express them without making someone feel uneasy. In general, relationships are somewhat destabilized now and your all-too-vivid fantasies won't necessarily add any certainty to the equation. Happily, you can indulge in your dreams without having to share them with anyone else until you are good and ready."
libra,2015-07-02,"You might as well keep your glass slippers polished, since at any moment you could be asked to be the belle (or prince) of the ball. Although your sweet charm wins the crowd over, there are additional reasons to anticipate a happy outcome. Make the most of whatever social activities you partake in today. A fairy tale ending is possible if you have the courage to break through your preconceived limitations. Show your sparkle and others will stand up and notice."
scorpio,2015-07-02,"Confronting troublesome issues is cathartic and can cultivate healing while the planets are in a forgiving mood. You are in better emotional shape now to express your feelings in your small corner of the world, so people can easily see your sincerity. Don't withdraw from your stated mission; your top priority is not about being nice today -- even if you are attempting to be kind in your delivery. Your primary purpose is to be true to yourself and honest with others."
sagittarius,2015-07-02,"Your keen ability to envision the distant horizon inspires you to make big plans for your future. But just because you have your next great adventure all mapped out in your mind, doesn't mean that anyone has a clue as to what you're up to yet. You're nearly ready to transform your intentions into actions so make the best use of these next few days to visualize your trajectory. When you have all the pieces in place, sharing your story with those you trust will empower you to make it real."
capricorn,2015-07-02,"You have been recently spending an inordinate amount of time exploring profound issues about your own mortality, your relationships and the mysteries of the universe. But as you attempt to make sense out of the changing landscape, you're anticipating moving into the next phase where things will lighten up. However, you're not free to jump into the future quite yet. Paradoxically, you have to find a way to integrate your spiritual perspective with your ambitious aspirations. It's not so complicated if you focus on the here and now."
aquarius,2015-07-02,"Coworkers or friends might be exceptionally nice to you now. Happily, you feel blessed with all this affection and attention, even if you're not sure why everyone is treating you so sweetly. Sometimes there aren't rational answers to all your questions. Joyfully connecting with others presents an opportunity to practice receiving love, no matter what you believe you really deserve. Your job is simple; open your heart and show your gratitude."
pisces,2015-07-02,Unresolved relationship dynamics can interfere with the good vibes all around you. It doesn't matter that you may be considering every possible emotional scenario if you're still clinging to the path you already chose. You need to let go of your certainty if you want to see real progress. Demonstrate the healing power of love by making the first move and meeting others halfway.
aries,2015-07-03,"You're relieved by the realization that the potential for positive change outweighs your fear of the unknown. You still don't know what to expect even if you're busy anticipating all the best-case scenarios. Events continue to unfold rapidly and you believe you must respond to them right away. Nevertheless, you have more time than you think, so give yourself permission now to experience the excitement without trying to figure everything out. Ironically, you will find your answers about the future by living in the present."
taurus,2015-07-03,"You're naturally more comfortable when you know exactly where every twist and turn will take you on the road ahead. Unfortunately, you're likely to grow anxious if you're unable to describe all the changes occurring in your life now. Luckily, you have a fantastic opportunity to envision your ideal world without the pressure of having to make your visions come true today. Temporarily set your most concrete goals aside and let your imagination guide you gently into the future. You can't achieve it until you dream it."
gemini,2015-07-03,"You can see farther into the distance today, but your perceptions of reality might not be as accurate as you think. Your enthusiasm is projected onto your surroundings while mischievous Mercury connects with jovial Jupiter, prompting you to imagine positive outcomes to complicated situations before you have all the facts in place. Be sure to explore the shadows, since trouble will surely surface later on if you ignore the subtleties. Investigate all the angles and then head in the direction of your chosen future. Making the most informed decisions possible vastly improves your chances for success."
cancer,2015-07-03,"Coordinating your natural desire for emotional security with your current career goals might require additional analysis. At first, you may resist risking your comfort in order to make progress at work. But feeling vulnerable isn't as frightening as the thought of missing a rare opportunity to get ahead. Even if the circumstances aren't as ideal as you wish, you still won't be able to forgive yourself if you don't give your dreams your best shot now. No apologies, no regrets."
leo,2015-07-03,"Your social network is in the midst of change, yet letting go of unhealthy relationships isn't as messy as you might expect. Your interests are shifting and a new acquaintance may reflect your current dreams better than an old one. Rather than fearfully clinging to the past, embrace the exciting potential that's around the next bend. Just remember, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition; you can make improvements without necessarily upsetting those who have your happiness at heart."
virgo,2015-07-03,"Your growing excitement over an innovative idea may cause you to lose track of your feelings today as cerebral Mercury aligns with ingenious Uranus and opportunistic Jupiter. Your current emotional detachment helps you think more clearly while visualizing your future, but over-analyzing a decision can also alienate you from your heart. Pay attention to the facts, but don't forget to delve deeper to uncover your true desires. Sometimes the most obvious choice isn't the one that leads to happiness."
libra,2015-07-03,"Your playful mood frees you from the weighty issues that have been lingering on your mind. The quirky Aquarius Moon is drifting through your 5th House of Creativity, intensifying your desire to express yourself more freely. Enjoy your newly found intellectual independence and explore all the different methods you can use to communicate your enthusiasm. However, without a touch of self-restraint you could easily end up wasting time on one unrealistic idea after another, leading you around in circles. Just remember that applying a small dose of caution greatly improves your game."
scorpio,2015-07-03,"Relationships with friends and relatives are in the process of transformation because your personal freedom is exceptionally valuable to you now and you're not likely to compromise it away. Although it's not in your best interest to walk out on your obligations; you just don't want anyone to assume that you'll simply show up on demand. If you want others to respect your boundaries today, you must be willing to state them as clearly as possible. Thankfully, you can express your needs now without triggering any awkward feelings if you're willing to be transparent."
sagittarius,2015-07-03,"Others are pushing your buttons, requiring you to take a stand today and announce your position. Luckily, people are more likely to truly hear your message while philosophical Jupiter plays wing man to communicator Mercury in your 7th House of Partners. One of your greatest strengths is that you almost always see the glass half full rather than half empty. Your overall attitude is more crucial than the choices you must make now, so don't diminish your power by suddenly harboring self-doubt. Ironically, it was Helen Keller who said, ""Keep your face to the sunshine and you cannot see a shadow."""
capricorn,2015-07-03,"Your unwavering courage inspires people to support you on your path to success. Your unwillingness to acknowledge the possibility of defeat has more of a positive impact on others now than you realize, making it nearly impossible for anyone to spread negativity in your presence. But don't let your optimism blind you to the facts or your allies will lose faith in your ability to make sensible judgments. Luckily, you can be confident in your convictions without slipping into denial if you put the truth above everything else."
aquarius,2015-07-03,"You're not in the market for approval from others now; you only seek their acknowledgment and respect. Fortunately, the evocative Moon's visit to your sign empowers you with clarity and encourages you to share your feelings. There's no reason to worry about someone's possible reaction today, for the truth of your words will stand on their own merit. Be genuine and speak from your heart; you will be accepted for your unique contribution by those who matter most."
pisces,2015-07-03,"You may believe your dreams are slipping away today as the reflective Moon disappears into your 12th House of Secrets. However, the possibility of turning your unfulfilled desires into reality is still growing, even if you're not aware of it in the present moment. Nevertheless, you might indulge yourself with a meandering detour through your favorite fantasies. Letting go of your hopes is not the right solution; use your fertile imagination to create the future you want, instead."
aries,2015-07-04,"Your inner life may be more complicated than it appears now, yet you don't want people to know just how much you're hiding. It's a lot simpler to participate socially if you downplay your unconventional interests. Restraining your impulsive behavior is wise today because your need for self-expression clashes with your current longing to build lasting relationships. Luckily, there's really no reason to share all your fantasies with others unless that's exactly what you want to do. Nevertheless, if you hope to create a deeper connection with someone you admire, you need to reveal your heart."
taurus,2015-07-04,"You may view your current social commitments as obligations rather than joyful activities. It's not that you won't have fun once you're in the company of friends or family; it's just that your sense of responsibility is in the spotlight while the Moon is shining in your 10th House of Public Life. Thankfully, you will soon forget about your earlier resistance once you remember how much you enjoy spending time with those you love. Relax and soak in the good vibes now without feeling the need to be in charge of every situation."
gemini,2015-07-04,"Even a strong dose of common sense may not be enough to keep you on task because you are  easily captivated by every little sweet thing that comes along. But shiny objects aren't as alluring as brilliant ideas now, so it's harder to be motivated simply by the temptation of a good time. Thankfully, your friends are standing by today, ready to distract you with interesting diversions. As long as you don't attempt to plan everything in advance, you could be in for a pleasant surprise. Spontaneity is your friend."
cancer,2015-07-04,"Expressing your feelings grows more challenging day by day, so the sooner you get started the better. Unfortunately, your fear of rejection might tempt you to quickly retreat to protect your feelings, especially if you find yourself in a deep discussion with an intimidating person. But even if you face the apparent resistance, your words may not flow easily at first because your emotions are still in flux. Be patient while measuring your progress; things will move along faster as your moods begin to settle down. Your heart has a timetable all of its own."
leo,2015-07-04,"You expect more from others than they're able to give today, increasing the likelihood of being let down by a close friend or family member. The problem is people seem to be out of touch with their feelings which makes them harder for you to read. If someone close to you appears to have lost his or her way, lend a sympathetic ear. Your emotional support is more useful now than attempting to make a heroic rescue. There's no need to save the day when all you have to do is listen."
virgo,2015-07-04,"Most of the jobs you end up with today are potential opportunities to experiment with a fresh attitude and a new approach. However, it's critical to know when to drop your eclectic idea or you could easily waste time seeking a breakthrough when the tried-and-true way is perfectly fine. Demonstrate your keen intelligence by choosing the most sensible method for the task at hand. Although innovation is impressive when it works, sometimes the same old routine is the most reliable path."
libra,2015-07-04,"Although you are eager for a play day, you're aware that the fun won't last forever. The social Aquarius Moon is hanging out in your 5th House of Fun and Games today, highlighting your need to be with your family and friends. However, you can already feel a heavier wave washing up on the shores of your life. Your chances for success are enhanced more by your attitude than anything else. The best way to prepare for the upcoming crunch is to rejuvenate your body and mind by basking in the good times while they last."
scorpio,2015-07-04,"You're ready and able to shine your love light brightly today because you want to do your part to raise the vibration of the cosmos. However, avoiding the facts isn't a wise strategy; denial only sets you up to have your altruistic expectations dashed. Nevertheless, your willingness to assume the best results could act as a catalyst that opens previously closed doors. Instead of dismissing an opportunity too quickly, consider it for its own merit. An objective assessment of your choices will steer you in the right direction."
sagittarius,2015-07-04,"You're not particularly interested in being the social director today; in fact, you really don't want to assume responsibility for nearly anything. Luckily, your world is chock full of amazing people and they each have something special to offer. You might assume it will be easy to find someone willing to pitch in and help your cause, but everyone could already be busy with their own plans. Compromising and accepting less in the moment may feel like your only option, but it's best to celebrate your independence by creating your own brand of fireworks, instead."
capricorn,2015-07-04,"You continue to be in touch with your softer side today, uncharacteristically wearing your heart on your sleeve. It's easier to relax your ambitious nature during holiday celebrations, but your current social savvy seems to go beyond the situation of the moment. Perhaps you're less afraid of being swept up in an emotional whirlwind because you feel as if your feet are firmly planted on solid ground. Whatever your rationalization, enjoy the potential pleasures in front of you now; carefully choose your best shot at happiness and then go for it."
aquarius,2015-07-04,"You might be certain that you can do everything today without any assistance from anyone else. Unfortunately, your confident defiance could lead to spreading yourself too thin, making it impossible to finish even the simplest chores. Don't lose sight of the practical realities that govern your life of you could miss out on the fun that's yours for the asking. It's more important now to share the workload with others so you can also share in the joy."
pisces,2015-07-04,"You may be on the fence about a significant personal issue because you can see it from both sides. Your current enthusiasm tempts you to say yes and jump wholeheartedly into a romantic relationship, a social event or a personal project. Meanwhile, the voice of reason is screaming no. Forcing a decision today will only require you to change your mind in the near future. Instead of making a final choice prematurely, give yourself a break and partake in the festivities, instead. A little rest and relaxation does you a world of good."
aries,2015-07-05,"You have too many options to choose from today because you are not restrained by reality. Although your fantasies might seem like pipe dreams to others, you're capable of extraordinary accomplishments now if you can focus on your ambitions. Nevertheless, it's prudent to maintain a practical perspective in spite of your penchant for daydreaming. Keeping your feet on the ground gives you the necessary traction to reach for the stars."
taurus,2015-07-05,"Your desires are pulling you into new territory while your common sense holds you in your current position. You're motivated by your innate need for emotional security, but you are increasingly intrigued by the distant horizon. Even if you choose to explore the unknown today, don't abandon your present routine, especially if someone is counting on you. Luckily, there's no reason to turn your life upside down in order to make substantial progress toward the future. Act strategically and the adventure awaits."
gemini,2015-07-05,"You're naturally talented at assimilating information and turning it to your advantage. However, it's not advisable to grow too attached to thinking your way through every problem because logic is a trap of its own. Don't rely solely on rational analysis now; instead, take a different path into your future by embracing your intuition. Sometimes, having faith in the process is more useful than having all the facts. Follow your intuition and everything will be alright."
cancer,2015-07-05,"You are quick to retreat into your fantasies today as your thoughts drift into an imaginary dimension where you are no longer bound by facts. Although everything is possible in your imagination, you still can't avoid close friends and relatives who keep drawing you back to the present moment, making it impossible for you to fully escape. Accept that you can live in two worlds now while you seek balance between objective circumstances and your subjective inner life. Juggling your dreams with your obligations is a trick you must master."
leo,2015-07-05,"Your cool demeanor begins to fade today as you're lured into deeper emotional realms. Although your interpersonal relationships can be a source of concern, you don't need to let your uncertainty lead you down a path of self-doubt. Tossing out your old assumptions gives you a new lease on life. But don't make any significant changes yet; instead, be content with integrating your current lessons into what you already know. Everyone is a student when it comes to matters of the heart."
virgo,2015-07-05,"You are highly motivated to improve your daily regimen now, but could get sidetracked worrying about the impact your changes might have on others. Obviously, being sensitive to those closest to you is important. Instead of just imagining the consequences of your actions, make a list of all the pros and cons. Preemptively discussing the most significant potential problems now may be enough to minimize any possible negativity before it manifests. A stitch in time saves nine."
libra,2015-07-05,"You may be bewildered about which chores you should do today, leading you to believe there's more to life now than finishing tasks. If you were planning on completing a project around the house, you suddenly could change your mind and decide that it's more critical to give yourself a day off. If you have trouble concentrating, try a bit of physical exercise to expend your excess energy before you settle down to work. Ultimately, if you can slip into a creative flow and be productive in some way, you'll be surprised at how easy it is to get back on track."
scorpio,2015-07-05,"The intensity in your relationships continues to mellow, but you still can't totally control all your reactions to what happens in your immediate environment. Although you're not looking for a fight, you don't want to hide the facts as you see them, either. Unfortunately, your unwillingness to play games now could make you seem less compassionate. Don't judge yourself harshly if you prefer nothing but the truth. Be kind; your uncensored honesty is appreciated more than you know."
sagittarius,2015-07-05,"You can't help but second-guess a recent decision, as today's events test your ability to maintain your integrity. You might know what's right in your heart, even if it doesn't necessarily agree with your logical conclusion. Making a choice may be particularly stressful now. However, going along with the majority is the right thing to do if you feel like part of the family or a valuable member of the group. Determine what choice you can live with and then stick with it, no matter what."
capricorn,2015-07-05,"Although you might think you're being sensitive to the needs of others now, you could railroad right over their protests without even realizing it. The spacey Pisces Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication this weekend, encouraging you to ramble on about your plans for the future. Conversations are fine, but all talk without follow-through doesn't really get you anywhere. It's great if you are eager to share your thoughts as long as you know when it's wise to just get to work."
aquarius,2015-07-05,"You're quite clever when it comes to communicating your ideas efficiently, but don't put too much stock in finding a verbal solution to a social situation today. Your willingness to present a softer and gentler side of your personality now is a mixed blessing, for it also allows you to evade an important issue by dancing around it. Acknowledging your vulnerability is more admirable than acting like a know-it-all. When you admit that you don't have all the answers, then others feel like they have something constructive to offer you for a change."
pisces,2015-07-05,"Your sensitive nature is evident in all your interactions now that the reflective Moon has returned to your emotional sign. However, you may be so in touch with your dreams today that you're also acutely aware of the gulf between your current circumstances and your ideal life. Practicing random acts of kindness dispels discouragement and enables you to keep your heart open. As you make a plan to help others, remember that you're also choosing your future. Thankfully, the choice is all yours."
aries,2015-07-06,"You may be resigned to defend a position on a matter at work now, even if it means taking an unpopular stance. Ironically, you gain a strange sort of satisfaction when you stand alone. It's not that you enjoy fighting losing battles, but there's nothing quite like the rush of adrenaline you experience when you're in warrior mode. Don't place too much stock in proving your superiority at the expense of someone else; just revel in the excitement of knowing how very alive you feel in the present moment."
taurus,2015-07-06,"Your attempts to communicate seem to go nowhere today because it seems like you're only talking to yourself, even if others are in close proximity. Your sense of well-being could dissipate now and you may even start to dread what's around the corner. Get a grip; the reality of the situation is really not that bad. Face the emotional intensity head on, since your fear of the unknown is worse than whatever you might encounter. Bold behavior and an unwavering faith in yourself are the keys to your success."
gemini,2015-07-06,"Your words are muddled by the influence of nebulous Neptune today, and you become less clear the more you ramble on. An unresolved issue can quickly come back to haunt you with unexpected vengeance if you attempt to talk your way out of a confrontation now. In fact, the power of the unspoken word might be strong enough to temporarily threaten a close relationship. Pause before you speak and then only say what is absolutely required. Your message will be well received if you remain considerate of others in the process."
cancer,2015-07-06,"You might feel as if you need to act on your new idea immediately or the opportunity to gain support will be lost. But if there are too many signs of difficulty on your path ahead, you may quickly crawl back into your shell, a cave or under a rock. Your vulnerable underbelly has been visible long enough and you're growing weary of keeping your defenses up. Trust your intuition; be safe and protect what is yours at all costs. Just keep in mind the current sense of urgency could be an illusion of your own making."
leo,2015-07-06,"A little honest self-reflection may reveal lingering remnants of unexpressed anger, although you will likely do your best to dodge this negativity today. These emotions might be subtle enough that you could easily disguise them as something else. However, harboring unresolved tension only leads to playing control games. Suppressed passions can resurface in the manipulations of someone close to you. Express your hurt without any malice to avoid inviting unnecessary trouble."
virgo,2015-07-06,"You're feeling a bit dazed and confused today, suffering from a lack of clarity as the moody Moon canoodles with mystical Neptune. However, you're intent on cutting through the fog to get to the bottom of a power struggle with a friend. This interaction can leave you in a state of agitation now, for acquiring more knowledge only seems to contradict the facts. Even if your uncertainty is irritating, don't take your annoyance out on anyone else by picking a needless fight. Accept your current frustration with a healthy sense of humor, knowing that this too shall pass within a few days."
libra,2015-07-06,"You may experience a dilemma around what is public and what is private in your life today. But you still could shy away from conflict even if you feel very strongly about your convictions. If you get into an argument, be careful not to make revelations about your own personal beliefs or habits that are better kept to yourself. Remember, it's more prudent to err on the side of saying less now because your disclosure can be diluted by too many words. Giving your message time to soak in allows the process to unfold organically."
scorpio,2015-07-06,"Your passionate nature could draw you into a conflict with a friend while the Sun opposes provocative Pluto. But your disagreement might be over a difference of ideas rather than something tangible. Unfortunately, burying your emotions won't work, either. The way out of this unstable situation is simply to allow for multiple points of view. Yours is not the only path to the top of the mountain, even if that's how it seems to you in the moment. Open your mind and give others the freedom to think for themselves."
sagittarius,2015-07-06,"Oddly enough, an emotional meltdown may be exactly what you need on your journey now, so don't assume an air of authority by playing the role of the holier-than-thou spiritual teacher. Paradoxically, you'll emerge rejuvenated if you can let loose and express your true feelings. And, although you might be totally surprised by your outburst, those around you will breathe a sigh of relief since they are tired of you claiming that everything is perfect. Drop the pretense and show your true colors if you want others to support your dreams."
capricorn,2015-07-06,"An issue previously brought into the light seems to be beyond your control, resurfacing now without your consent. The more you attempt to manage the situation today, the more complex everything grows. On the contrary, if you loosen your grip on the steering wheel, you could be amazed when things begin to fall into place. Luckily, you will have the final say in the matter, even if it appears unlikely at the beginning. Not only do you have the chance to reclaim your power within the next few days, but you can also make solid progress toward your goals."
aquarius,2015-07-06,"Although you're often the one who can quickly dismiss an old experience, you're not so fast to embrace the future today. A nostalgic trip down Memory Lane anchors you to your past, making it impossible to see how your habits have become obstacles to your happiness. However, it's far more effective to initiate preemptive behavior than waiting for something catastrophic to happen. Instead of resisting inevitable changes, take a proactive stance. You can forge a new path if you grab this opportunity while it lasts."
pisces,2015-07-06,"Taking the time to reassess where you find the most joy in your life can be quite eye-opening today. Even if you haven't already scheduled some quiet time, it's essential for your sanity to add it into your day. But don't wait until you're so busy that you can't even hear yourself think. Knowing what makes your heart happy now is the first step to achieving true satisfaction, so clear some room on your calendar for contemplation before it's too late."
aries,2015-07-07,"You truly thought business was handled and everyone was on the same page, but now it appears you're sadly mistaken. You may have misread the situation or someone might have purposefully misled you. Either way, a disagreement flares back up as unexpressed feelings rush to the surface. Although you believe you're engaged in a fight to the finish, the Moon's return to your sign also offers you an opportunity to clear the air and begin anew. Give peace a chance; life's too short to spend time in endless conflict."
taurus,2015-07-07,"The cosmos is handing you a well-deserved moment to retreat and recuperate today, but this mellow phase won't last long. Someone could ambush you with their personal demands, but luckily, you have a clever defense to defuse a potentially volatile conversation. Unfortunately, the obvious solution isn't likely the right one. Rather than confronting the situation head-on now, you might be better off going your separate ways for a while. A cooling-off period may be just what everyone needs to gain a fresh perspective and a more positive attitude."
gemini,2015-07-07,"You may feel like time is running out, accentuating your sense of urgency to achieve your goals. You're trying to connect with the right people, but seem to be fighting an uphill battle of crossed messages and incomplete conversations. This is fleet-footed Mercury's last day of his extended visit to your curious-minded sign, adding a frenetic buzz to your thinking. Thankfully, understanding the source of your anxiety helps to calm your nerves. Your outlook vastly improves once you realize the chaotic pace will slow down in the next few days. The sky is not falling; take a deep breath and relax."
cancer,2015-07-07,"Lately you have been lulled into a false sense of security, but the game is currently changing faster than you might realize. Relationship dynamics are shifting, and you may already be using your crablike pincers to attempt to cling to the past. But your fears of the unknown are misplaced since the days ahead will likely be an improvement over the past. Cleaning up old business as quickly as possible helps to lighten the load you need to carry into the future."
leo,2015-07-07,"You're ready to pack your bags and head off into the sunset with your favorite traveling companion, but your timing may be off. Matching your schedule with someone else's can be more challenging now than you expected. When you discover that your friend can't accompany you on your big adventure today, you might waste your energy persuading them to turn their life upside down to accommodate your optimum timetable. Nevertheless, this pushy strategy won't work. It could take more time than you wish, but your best route to fulfilling your dream is to find common ground on which you both can stand."
virgo,2015-07-07,"You may not be making as much progress on your career path as you prefer. Climbing the ladder of success isn't easy because there are others playing supporting roles on your ambitious journey. Unfortunately, your associates might not even share similar goals, further complicating the current dynamics. Communication can be infuriating today; it's as if you're each reading from different scripts. Your best bet may be to take a hiatus and revisit the discussion in a few days when everyone is in a more positive frame of mind. Sometimes agreeing to disagree is the quickest way to cultivate peace."
libra,2015-07-07,"Someone is pushing your buttons today and you're likely to take it very personally. But even if your assumptions are built on facts, you still may be overreacting. People have a variety of agendas and are motivated for a wide range of reasons. You might be jumping to an erroneous conclusion if you believe anyone is purposefully trying to thwart your efforts. Fortunately, you're a pro at diplomacy; your friendly charm can disarm almost anyone when you focus it in the right direction."
scorpio,2015-07-07,"No matter how hard you try, you just can't seem to please anyone today. But it's as if reality is testing you to determine which obstacle irritates you most. Your gut reaction is to push back with even more determination so you can get the results you know are possible. Unfortunately, you won't win by increasing your effort now, even if your willpower is strong. Stop struggling and give it a rest; quit working against the current flow of energy. Surprisingly, much of the resistance will fade once your own mindset improves. The only one you have to prove anything to is yourself."
sagittarius,2015-07-07,"Your creativity may be off the hook today, but others don't seem to have an inkling of the artistic message you're trying to convey. You pour your heart into painting a picture or writing a song and, naturally, are quite proud of your production. But somehow your peers respond with puzzled smiles, and needless to say, you feel like an unappreciated artist. Ultimately, art is subjective and there's no telling who will find your work meaningful. Following your muse can be a lonely endeavor, but expressing your imagination is one of life's greatest joys."
capricorn,2015-07-07,"Too many trivial tasks keep you from focusing on your long-term aspirations today. Your frustration mounts because the daily noise seems to just get louder no matter what you try to do to shut it down. Under normal circumstances, you might be able to just shrug it off and return to your work. However, you're reaching a breaking point now that someone's emotional intensity is pushing you to the edge. Don't be afraid of speaking your piece to reestablish healthy boundaries. Just remember you will successfully get your point across if you are as kind as you are direct in the delivery of your message."
aquarius,2015-07-07,"You don't need any external distractions today, especially if your own thoughts are running amok. There are so many colorful ideas dancing in your head that it's nearly impossible to concentrate on your work. Nevertheless, responsibilities call and you must answer. It's time to stop and get serious about your obligations. Fortunately, you're capable of extraordinary mental feats; you can alter your thinking process to accommodate reality when you must. Quit chasing your tail and get to work."
pisces,2015-07-07,"Your core values are shifting to reflect your new philosophical perspective, but you're not sure how to make the transition real. Part of the problem is your current lack of direction. It's as if a fog has descended, preventing you from clearly seeing the path right in front of you. You might overcompensate by speeding up to hide your uncertainty. Unfortunately, a strategy built on denial will only court disaster as you run off the road. Slow down and share your vulnerability with trusted allies who can help in your process of transformation."
aries,2015-07-08,"No matter how busy your schedule is today, it's time to stop and reassess your current trajectory. Although the impetuous Aries Moon can trick you into thinking you should bolt ahead, you might end up missing what's right in front of your nose. Instead of wasting your energy starting projects that lead nowhere, visualize your final destination and create a viable plan to achieve your dreams. Establishing a steady pace is one essential element of your success, but knowing exactly where you want to go makes all the difference in the world."
taurus,2015-07-08,"You might not feel very motivated today, even if you know fulfilling your obligations should be your top priority. You're lost in your own dream world, which isn't necessarily a bad thing if it doesn't keep you from accepting responsibility for your actions. It's tricky to determine your limits on your own now, but it's possible to still find time to relax in between meeting your commitments. Thankfully, you can rely on someone you trust to provide you with the objectivity that you currently lack. Striking the right balance between work and play is a lifelong challenge."
gemini,2015-07-08,"You're ready to say yes to nearly anything today. Fortunately, the enterprising Aries Moon sparks your enthusiasm to deliver on a promise. However, you might inadvertently deceive yourself if you don't take time to consciously separate the facts from the fantasies. This temporary lack of clarity doesn't mean that you should say no to an intriguing opportunity or an enticing invitation. Just make sure you have an escape route so you can bail, if necessary. There's no point in participating if it isn't in your best interest. Taking action is more effective if you do it sooner than later."
cancer,2015-07-08,Your personal growth may be impeded by a few obstacles now and it's time to face these lingering issues once and for all. The most effective way to overcome your internal resistance is to get creative about reaching your goals. Cerebral Mercury's shift into your inner-directed sign strengthens your ability to direct your thoughts. Imagining the best-case scenarios for your future helps you focus on the positive potential rather than worrying about what could go wrong. Good times are calling; making progress in the safety of your own mind today sets the stage for progress in the real world tomorrow.
leo,2015-07-08,"Conflicting voices in your head are giving you very different advice today. One is telling you that life is beautiful and you should seize this lovely opportunity to indulge your fantasies. However, your voice of maturity warns that the pursuit of pleasure isn't currently wise. You have too much work to do and there's no time to slack off. Honestly, picking one strategy over the other isn't healthy; your only logical move is to forge a middle path. Your unique formula for success is to balance your need to be a responsible adult with your current yearning to let your inner child out to play."
virgo,2015-07-08,"Opportunities are knocking loudly at your door today as messenger Mercury enters your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Nevertheless, achieving your objectives requires more time than you prefer. Even if you envision minor problems ahead, take a chance and go after what you want anyhow. Just make sure you're not missing any important details that could trip you up later on. Although it's not your usual style, you can exaggerate the current potential if you don't stay grounded in reality. Your enthusiasm is commendable, but a little practicality now contributes toward your future success."
libra,2015-07-08,"Your expectations may be outrageously unrealistic while sexy Mars trines surreal Neptune. It's one thing to use dreams as a source of inspiration, but you need to exercise caution or you could set yourself up for disappointment. Your flexible attitude enables you to easily accommodate changes in other people's plans that impact yours, but it still might be hard to get motivated now. Thankfully, your friendly approach can rub off on those around you, creating a supportive atmosphere for all involved. There are lessons to be learned on this journey that can't be rushed."
scorpio,2015-07-08,"You can't wait to manifest the big ideas you have planned for the day, but everything seems to move at a snail's pace. Your frustration could complicate matters further unless you consciously choose to accept delays that are out of your control with a sense of humor. Fortunately, you can set a positive spin on your life by realigning your expectations and acknowledging that you might not finish everything on schedule. Pushing the river won't help it reach the sea any quicker, but changing your attitude to one of patience and gratitude will help you to make the most of the ride."
sagittarius,2015-07-08,"Constraining your excitement about what you hope to accomplish is difficult, but the day's events require you to tone down your initial enthusiasm just a notch. Your intentions may be honorable, but you might discover that you have bitten off more than you can chew now. Don't waste time kicking yourself if you aren't living up to your high ideals. Your knack for seeing the glass as half full rather than half empty is one of your strengths. Use your natural optimism to propel your progress in the days ahead."
capricorn,2015-07-08,"Your modus operandi is to rely on your common sense to guide you along the most efficient path. But you are uncharacteristically inclined to stray off course today as you imagine all the enjoyable activities you could be spending your time on, instead. Nevertheless, consider where you want to be in the long run and develop a concrete plan to reach your destination. There's no hurry, so start off slowly and set a sustainable pace that allows you the chance to enjoy the scenery along the way."
aquarius,2015-07-08,"Finding the physical stamina necessary to complete your chores is challenging while fuzzy Neptune diffuses energetic Mars. Your attention meanders off into fantasyland, leaving you feeling lost in space. You might even convince yourself that you can let the day slide by without doing much of anything at all. Nevertheless, you're capable of busting through the fog and emerging a hero, but it will require both intention and discipline. If you set your priorities early in the day and tenaciously focus on your goals, your persistence will pay off in ways you can't imagine."
pisces,2015-07-08,"You're trying to build a bridge to your dreams step by step, one stone at a time. Although the ground beneath your feet is not as solid as you wish, a well-constructed foundation will be strong enough to support you. You are inflating your visions of the future today, like a child blows up a balloon. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to determine rational limits now. You may not find satisfaction if you assume the solution is right around the next corner. Happiness can only be found in the present moment when you begin to count your blessings."
aries,2015-07-09,"The promise of romance inspires you to take a risk with your heart today. However, your passions move to the back burner as the day wears on, so express your feelings in the moment if you believe they are more than just a passing fancy. Although your emotions cool off by mid-afternoon, your thoughts grow more rebellious as mental Mercury creates sparks with irrepressible Uranus in your sign. Thankfully, your ingenuity can be used for constructive purposes if you set your intentions in advance and work for a greater cause than just your own."
taurus,2015-07-09,"You're already planning ahead as you consider the merits of starting a new project. However, circumstances require you to tie up loose ends before moving forward. Although progress may be slow, clearing your plate early in the day makes room for the exciting changes waiting in the wings. However, the moody Moon's return to your sign conjures up unresolved feelings from the past. You might have to take one more bittersweet look back before you can release any lingering regrets. It's exhilarating when you finally let go of old emotional baggage and step into the future."
gemini,2015-07-09,"Ingenious ideas are flying around fast and furious, but you aren't quick enough to grab one as it speeds by today. Try as you might, the most brilliant speculations slip through your fingers and vanish into thin air, leaving you annoyed and unsatisfied. Instead of repeatedly attempting to prolong fleeting moments, a totally different strategy is advised. There's no need to capture the muse; allow your thoughts to ebb and flow without intervention. Paradoxically, you'll be able to recall the cream of the crop after the energetic wave passes and you can focus on coloring in the details."
cancer,2015-07-09,"Although Crabs are often known for hiding in their shells, you're likely to be the one to take center stage today. In fact, you can stand out in a group as well as anyone else as long as you are playing to a friendly crowd. Fortunately, your originality and scintillating wit are apparent as clever Mercury in your sign creates a magical quintile with brilliant Uranus. Don't wait for a better day to strut your stuff since cosmic luck is on your side now. Shine, baby, shine."
leo,2015-07-09,"People depend on your inspiration for guidance as the reflective Moon enters your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Oddly enough, your growing popularity comes at a time when you want nothing more than to retreat into the privacy of your lair. You're weary of all the drama and deserve a break. The good news is everyone will survive the temporary loss of your leadership because they know you will return to the fray soon enough, rejuvenated and roaring to go. Believe it or not, someone else can run the show while you luxuriate in the quiet inner sanctums of your imagination."
virgo,2015-07-09,"You may assume there is safety in numbers today, prompting you to actively seek support from your social network. Ironically, you might actually be the one who is nurturing someone else's dreams these days. Fortunately, this is a win-win situation; everyone benefits from your need to be a valuable part of a larger group or collective cause. As much gratification as you gain from responding to the needs of others, the real gift is the spiritual growth you experience when you also acknowledge the yearnings of your own heart, too."
libra,2015-07-09,"Making steady progress at work today leaves you with a feeling of deep satisfaction. But prepare for unusual things to occur when you take time to communicate your ideas to your peers. Fortunately, others are receiving your message with open minds now, increasing the odds of a favorable outcome. However, you're particularly effective when you don't say everything that's on your mind, leaving your audience wanting more. Saving some of the magic for another day works to your advantage in the long run."
scorpio,2015-07-09,"All work and no play is your motto today. However, even the most arduous tasks could lead to a good time as pleasure-seeking Venus and jolly Jupiter get busy in your 10th House of Career. However, you still might grow weary of the emotional constraints that go along with climbing the professional ladder. At some point in the very near future you may realize that your personal connections with people are more important to you than any job promotion. When all is said and done, there are many ways to measure success."
sagittarius,2015-07-09,"Sharing responsibilities at work lightens your load on one hand but also brings an additional layer of complications on the other. You can't escape the fact that the more people working together also means multiple strategies to reach a common goal. Accordingly, you may need to be flexible enough to incorporate the best ideas of the group into your preconceived plan. Nevertheless, if you want the collaboration to succeed, establish a harmonious rhythm early in the day that everyone can sustain."
capricorn,2015-07-09,"There's little chance of sidestepping relationship drama today so don't let a sudden emotional interaction catch you off guard. Thankfully, you are more likely to respond without losing your footing if you have a clue as to what's coming. Although you might prefer to postpone a difficult discussion, the more honest you are from the beginning, the better the outcome. Just remember that maintaining clear communication channels is essential or you could be in for a rude surprise. Your willingness to listen as much as you speak saves the day."
aquarius,2015-07-09,"You might want to spend the day basking in relationship bliss, but you have professional promises to keep. Your personal life may be sweet these days, but it could distract you from the real challenge at hand. Luckily, you can deftly manage both the personal and business ends of your life but it will take extra charm and finesse to juggle everyone's demands. Allocating your resources strategically is the key to everything working seamlessly.  It's true you can have the best of both worlds if you're willing to put in the effort."
pisces,2015-07-09,"You may experience a lack of support as you try to express your unique brand of creativity today. In fact, it could even seem as if others are purposefully thwarting your efforts or belittling your talent. Unfortunately, a temporary retreat won't likely be a productive one. Although it's understandable if your feelings are hurt now, don't waste time putting credence into anyone else's negativity, real or imagined. Continue on your chosen path with unwavering determination; your persistence is your secret weapon."
aries,2015-07-10,"You have the stamina to finish whatever endeavor you choose to start today. Your current determination and discipline enables you to outperform your peers at work. However, staying with a task until completion is still contrary to your basic instincts. Although you can surprise people with your persistence now, you are acutely aware of the personal freedom sacrificed when you wholeheartedly commit to one goal. Normally, you might bolt when the going gets tough, but now you're eager to stick around to see the fruits of your labor. If you build it, they will come."
taurus,2015-07-10,"Your heart is full of love and affection for friends and family members alike and you're willing to communicate about anything that comes up in the natural flow of conversation today. You want everyone to know how much you care, even if your words don't get your sentiment across very well. It's as if your message is fine as you formulate it in your head, but something is lost in translation. Nevertheless, your sincerity won't go unnoticed; others will appreciate your good intentions more than you know."
gemini,2015-07-10,"You may feel invisible today, as if people don't even know you're in the same room. Your automatic reaction might be to talk louder and laugh harder to attract attention, but you are unlikely to gain much of an audience. This surprising resistance can act as a catalyst to fire up your resolve. Shifting your focus from everyone else to yourself gives you the time to reexamine your beliefs and sort out your dreams. You have an excellent chance of blossoming under the bright lights if you simply are true to your heart."
cancer,2015-07-10,"Whether you like it or not, you're wearing your emotions on your sleeve today. You might as well accept the fact that you can't hide a thing from anyone who cares about your well-being. Fortunately, you can turn the cosmic timetables to your advantage if you're willing to let down your guard and be fully authentic, even if it's uncomfortable at first. Personal growth isn't all roses and rainbows, but the effort can be gratifying on so many levels in the end."
leo,2015-07-10,"Ironically, you can use your most outrageous visions to inspire your future today. Work takes on a spiritual edge now, and being in touch with your subconscious mind opens up new vistas and helps you find renewed purpose. You're not required to do anything special in this moment but appreciate your broader perspective. Nevertheless, good fortune lingers from the recent Venus-Jupiter conjunction, blessing your efforts to reach for the stars, if you are so inclined."
virgo,2015-07-10,"You have a lovely opportunity to pursue your dreams today in a pragmatic manner now. What might normally be considered totally unrealistic now seems to be within your reach. Nevertheless, you can still become quite uncomfortable if your vulnerability shows in a situation where you would prefer to appear strong and stoic. Acknowledge the truth as you see it, especially if you're out of your comfort zone. Push past your fears of the irrational and the unknown. Integrating your subjective impressions with the objective world is possible if you keep both your head and your heart open."
libra,2015-07-10,"Your work is demanding more of your time these days, and being away from your home and family is beginning to have a negative impact on your relationships. You really don't want to ignore domestic issues, but you can't pass up the current opportunities for possible career advancement. It's OK to temporarily sacrifice a little emotional involvement for future success. Communicate to your loved ones that your absence isn't personal, it's professional."
scorpio,2015-07-10,"Just when you thought it was safe to come out of the water, a subtle shift may occur, alerting you to some resistance lurking beneath the surface. However, even if everything seems copacetic on the relationship front, this is not the time to coast. Don't wait until the mood grows tense; start an honest conversation while it can still be friendly. Approach the changes you want to implement from a loving space, but remember that not everyone is as passionate as you. Give others time and space to sort out their feelings before you make any drastic moves."
sagittarius,2015-07-10,"It's not in your nature to relinquish your high expectations unless you have a very good reason. Everyone seems to have his or her own agenda and you want the absolute best outcome in each and every case. Nevertheless, you still may have to set your personal goals aside while you take a more practical approach and deal with what's on your plate today. Making solid progress on mundane issues makes room for visionary thinking later on. Taking care of business now allows you to chase your dreams in the future."
capricorn,2015-07-10,"You are hoping that all of your favorite people can join you in your pursuit of simple pleasures today. Unfortunately, everyone seems to have different plans for the day and they aren't inclined to drop them at a moment's notice. You could waste precious time and energy trying to convince others to change their minds and accompany you on your latest adventure, but it's wiser to just let them do their own thing now. Concentrate on following your bliss without worrying about anything else."
aquarius,2015-07-10,"Old habits die hard, but there may be intelligent reasons to hang on to them if they are still serving you well. However, even the tried and true routines need an upgrade every now and then. But before you decide the time has come to shake things up in ways you can't undo, reevaluate what's working and what's not. Remember, you're not the only person in the picture; consider how your changes might affect those you love. Discussing your thoughts before finalizing any plans gives others a chance to contribute to your personal growth."
pisces,2015-07-10,"Your message might be lost under the churning waves of emotional stress as you're lured deep into the seas of your wild imagination these days. But discerning what you really want from love and life is required before you even know which way to stand. Romantic desires can confuse your interactions at work. However, finding creative bliss is now a simple matter of trust. It's not nearly as complicated as you think; in fact, following your heart will lead you to your truth, and the truth will set you free."
aries,2015-07-11,"It seems like everyone else is content to lazily soak up the sun at the pool or the beach, but you need some action. It feels as if time is flying by and you can't wait any longer to embark on your next thrilling adventure, with or without a sidekick. Nevertheless, it's best not to follow your restless impulses now since they have led to trouble more than once. Hold your horses; a little rest and relaxation today may be exactly what the doctor ordered. Life moves too fast as it is; slow down and make the good times last."
taurus,2015-07-11,"It may be impossible for anyone to budge you from your favorite spot today as you enjoy kicking back with your friends. You feel particularly lazy now, so any fun activity that doesn't require a lot of effort on your part sounds like a great idea. This might be a lovely day for a picnic as long as someone else does most of the planning and preparation. Don't be so resistant to share in the work; your participation could be the final ingredient needed to make your perfect day even sweeter."
gemini,2015-07-11,"You might choose to pass on a last-minute invitation today, even if the party sounds like fun. Although you're a natural at mixing and mingling, you may not be in the mood for crowds now. Perhaps you're feeling a bit vulnerable and you prefer being left alone for a while so you can process your emotions without having to explain them to anyone else. Don't worry about the expectations of others; a bit of solitude gives you a chance to get your groove back in time for a night out on the town."
cancer,2015-07-11,"You're in your element today, entertaining friends and family with your favorite foods and captivating stories. You are the consummate host and are eager to create a lovely event for everyone to enjoy. But there's no reason to feel obligated to jump through hoops for others now if you're not receiving some pleasure out of it yourself. Having a party is a wonderful idea as long as you get the chance to relax and celebrate, too. Make sure your needs aren't lost in the shuffle and the day will be one to remember."
leo,2015-07-11,"You wish you could indulge in your favorite summer activities today, but your ambitious schedule doesn't seem to allow enough time for play. Unfortunately, being the responsible one in the group isn't much fun when everyone else seems to be having such a blast. Thankfully, no one will find fault with you if you jump into the pool for a delightful splash or partake in some delicious barbeque. Just don't forget what you want to accomplish by the end of the day. You can successfully enjoy a bit of spontaneity as long as you return to your commitments with renewed resolve and unwavering focus."
virgo,2015-07-11,"You are doing a masterful job hiding the mischief you're creating today. Perhaps you want others to think you're being conscientious, but while people assume you're busy working you might actually be off on a little adventure. If it's impossible to break from your routine now, just use your imagination to explore uncharted territory and you won't have to explain your absence to anyone. Taking pleasure in going on a secret escapade may be the way to have the best of both worlds."
libra,2015-07-11,"You might put on quite the show today, naturally playing the role of the hospitable host or gracious guest. However, you may be harboring secret thoughts that you're not willing to share at this time. There's nothing wrong with being generous with your time and affection, but believing that you need to entertain everyone is not in your best interest. Chase pleasurable pursuits on your own if you feel like it; others can fend for themselves, if necessary. You will never know what is on the other side of the fence unless you go look."
scorpio,2015-07-11,"A friend or partner may demand your undivided devotion to their needs today. But you are at a breaking point and you don't want to be at another person's beck and call, no matter how much you love them. Thankfully, you Scorpios have no problem setting clear boundaries when you must. However, it's crucial to let everyone know exactly where you stand early in the game or someone's feelings could get hurt. The best time to do something nice is when you feel it and not when it's expected. True generosity must come from the heart."
sagittarius,2015-07-11,"Oddly enough, paring back your plans may be the secret to your current satisfaction. The bottom line is the less you do today the more you will enjoy yourself. Perhaps a mellow camping trip would make your heart happy. Or even a simple nature walk with someone special could be enough to revitalize your perspective. Just remember, deep joy is possible when you're not distracted by too many things that ultimately won't matter in the long run."
capricorn,2015-07-11,"You pragmatic goats know it's a simple fact of life: you can't always get what you want. Unfortunately, no matter how sunny it is outside today, there may be a little gray cloud following you around wherever you go. Thankfully, your best friends are happy to hang out with you even if you're not feeling at the top of your game. Being in a social setting without having to prove your competence may be enough to dissipate your bad mood and bring back the blue skies. Leaning on others for a change does your heart a world of good."
aquarius,2015-07-11,"You've had enough of the annoyingly cheerful Pollyanna line, ""It's all good."" In your mind, everything isn't always beautiful. But don't spoil another person's day just because you are singing the blues. Although you intuitively know that others are just trying to be friendly, you're not buying the optimism they're selling today. Unfortunately, your hyper-rational approach could inadvertently shut out those who are your best allies. You don't have to be gullible to possess an open mind."
pisces,2015-07-11,"You aren't necessarily thrilled with the fact that you have to deal with the mundane world today, but you may experience a series of minor crises that require your immediate attention. You might resist at first, pretending you can keep floating in your dreamworld without any worries. But the sooner you accept life for what it is, rather than how you paint it in your fantasies, the better it will be for everyone involved. Although you love to get lost in your imagination, responding to reality as it unfolds leaves you feeling more vibrantly alive than anything else."
aries,2015-07-12,"Your willingness to gamble your emotional security for the possibility of an amazing experience might upset someone close to you today. There's nothing wrong with wanting to stretch the envelope of your reality but reckless behavior won't likely bring the satisfaction you want. Nevertheless, you can make the most of your current curiosity by making a methodical plan before you do anything else. Remember, sometimes being prepared is just as important as what you do after you swing into motion."
taurus,2015-07-12,"You're tempted to rock the boat today without considering the consequences. However, running off to fulfill your fantasies isn't the most productive use of your energy now that unpredictable Uranus is in the picture. Although you might be itching to break free from your regular weekend routine, moving too fast may leave you standing on unstable ground. It's more constructive to free up your time so you can visualize the endless possibilities that exist outside of the box. Whatever you imagine is yours to make real."
gemini,2015-07-12,"Expressing your unconventional feelings is liberating, but you may end up scattering your energy in the process. Luckily, you can get away with bending the rules in the name of innovation today, and you're even tempted to make up new ones along the way. It's exhilarating when all the details fall into place and everything goes according to your plan. Enjoy the fun, but don't expect it to last forever. Sooner or later, you must return to the real world and take care of any unfulfilled obligations you left stranded behind in your excitement."
cancer,2015-07-12,"You're less concerned about other people's reactions to your need for freedom because you think you can claim your power now without being judged. You're driven to shine your individualistic light today as irrepressible Uranus squares the radiant Sun in your sign. Although spontaneously emerging from your shell is refreshing, you could do something foolish if you don't take a few minutes to think about the consequences of your actions. It's your day to show your true colors, but consider your audience prior to performing your song and dance."
leo,2015-07-12,"Your dreams are too big to fit into your waking world, but you are driven to turn your fantasies into reality anyhow. Even if you know your chances of success are slim, you're still motivated to give it your best shot. But rather than just pushing forward, take time to develop a strategic plan of attack. It's a mistake to think anything is possible now unless you're committed to exerting the necessary effort. Thankfully, time is on your side, so don't exhaust yourself by trying to do everything at once."
virgo,2015-07-12,"You may be stressed out by all the social pressures pushing and pulling you in a million different directions. Happily, you can turn a challenging day into a memorable experience by simply doing the right thing. Instead of wasting time trying to convince others to support your agenda, just do the absolute best job you can with whatever is currently on your plate. Have faith in your moral compass now. Once your actions are in harmony with your heart, your performance will likely surpass everyone's greatest expectations."
libra,2015-07-12,"Motivating yourself these days can be a challenge because your professional goals are in flux. Ironically, you might feel unusually calm today, even if you're caught up in the center of a storm. The sudden chaos that's swirling around you inspires you to hold on to your current position with even greater determination. Nevertheless, you can't resist change forever. Don't sit idly waiting for lightning to strike; it's smarter to take preemptive action when you have the chance."
scorpio,2015-07-12,"You could become so deeply engrossed in a project today that it temporarily consumes your life. Something that starts as a relatively minor chore suddenly grows in complexity as you reassess all your options. An ingenious plan might explode into awareness now like a sudden flash of inspiration, tempting you to take immediate action. Unfortunately, impulsive behavior will demonstrate your recklessness rather than your intelligence. Be patient; the most valuable ideas will continue to develop into polished gems over time."
sagittarius,2015-07-12,"Try as you might, you just can't wipe that mischievous smile off your face today. Your enthusiasm may be contagious but it's tricky if you don't have a way to express your creativity. Unfortunately, ignoring your far-out ideas only fuels their power and adds to your frustration. Wait for an appropriate moment to casually discuss your ideas without being attached to what happens next. If there's no pressure for others to respond, you'll feel more relaxed and able to proceed with your original intentions. Getting everything out in the open is your key to satisfaction."
capricorn,2015-07-12,Maintaining your customary role of being the responsible one in your family or group of friends grows more taxing as the day progresses. The problem stems from your current excitement about exploring unexpressed facets of your own creativity. You might even consider taking a leap of faith to break through long-standing self-imposed limitations. But shocking people with your current spontaneity isn't useful in the long run; start simply by revealing some of your thoughts. It's easier to turn a brilliant idea into positive action when you move slowly and steadily at first.
aquarius,2015-07-12,"Following orders is more challenging than ever while rebellious Uranus squares the Sun in your 6th House of Daily Routine, urging you to break rules just for the sake of freedom of expression. However, you might attempt to suppress your radical behavior now because you don't want to be rejected by your friends and relatives. Nevertheless, you can get away with the unusual now since others won't judge you as harshly as you think. In fact, they may secretly admire you most when you dance to your own drummer."
pisces,2015-07-12,"You're walking a fine line today and even those routines that usually seem so comforting can trigger anxiety instead. Your emotions are on edge and you are ready to snap at the slightest provocation. However, losing your temper will only sap your energy and annoy others. Discussing your concerns in a rational manner is a much smarter strategy now than ignoring them because your worries won't simply disappear on their own. Happily, the answers you seek could be closer than you realize if you keep an open mind while addressing the underlying issues."
aries,2015-07-13,"You're often the first one out the door in the morning, but you might prefer lingering over breakfast today. Your fantasies may have you yearning to stay home, lost in sweet bliss with someone you love. However, even if you could temporarily shut out the world, the idea probably sounds better than the reality. Anyway, you can't hide from work no matter how tempting it seems. Fortunately, you don't have to go to extreme measures to experience emotional satisfaction. Simply taking the time to let others know how much you care deepens the connections."
taurus,2015-07-13,"You want more than just small talk today, even when communicating with your coworkers. Move beyond subjects like sports and the weather by sharing your concerns about global issues. Thankfully, you flourish in the company of like-minded people, and can be extremely eloquent when your opinions are validated. Obviously, you must exercise discretion but don't let your fear of getting too personal stop you from taking a conversation to the next level. As long as you're as good of a listener as you are a talker now, you'll know when to lighten up the mood to keep the situation from growing awkward."
gemini,2015-07-13,"You may be searching for a deeper meaning to your work, but the truth is you're so idealistic now that you could inadvertently set yourself up for failure. There's nothing wrong with wanting to align your career with your core values, but you might not be able to find a paying job doing what makes your soul happy. Luckily, the Moon's presence in your sign today enables you to change your mind faster than you can shift directions. Widening your perspective and exploring your options might be all it takes to put your life back on track."
cancer,2015-07-13,"Making a wish is a good first step today, but it won't necessarily manifest a magic solution. You must whole-heartedly believe that your goal is attainable and diligently work toward achieving it. But the fine line between concrete objectives and elusive pipedreams is tough to navigate now. In order to make the most of this cosmic opportunity, be discerning when weeding out the delusions from the dreams. When you can tell fact from fiction, you'll be on your way to choosing a goal worthy of your time and effort."
leo,2015-07-13,"You may not allow anyone to see how much you're struggling now, and your defensive tactics are probably doing the trick. Normally, your pride can stand in your way of revealing your vulnerabilities so others don't get to experience your authenticity. But if push comes to shove, you're more likely to gamble with your heart and share your emotional dilemma today. Although you will likely feel a welcome sense of relief if you bravely tell others the truth, reserve the details for another day. Not all secrets are meant to be shared."
virgo,2015-07-13,"You can be lured down a rabbit hole so quickly today that your head spins and you won't even know what happened. You're so open-hearted and trusting when it comes to relationships now that you may come across as uncharacteristically gullible. But don't throw your common sense out the window and give your power of discernment away to those who haven't earned it. Stand back to put things into proper perspective. Paradoxically, scaling down your larger-than-life expectations of the future helps to stabilize your progress in the present moment."
libra,2015-07-13,"Your current passion for your work is prompting you to take your career ambitions to new heights. Unfortunately, it might be a steep uphill battle as you attempt to manage all the moving parts. There's a lot of chatter in the air now, but you can still recognize a good idea for what it is if you remain open-minded. You might benefit by coloring in the details of the big picture, but it's not the best cosmic timing for making a commitment. Waiting a couple of days for your clarity to return gives you a better chance of actually delivering what you promise."
scorpio,2015-07-13,"You're indulgently swimming in your own watery element today when it comes to sharing your feelings or expressing your creativity. However, you might want to recite an epic poem while someone else would prefer a simple tweet. Either way, your meaning is the same; it's just a matter of different delivery styles. Unfortunately, you'll lose your audience before you make your point if you ramble on endlessly. The shorter and sweeter your message, the more likely it will touch the minds and hearts of others."
sagittarius,2015-07-13,"Your connections with others are based upon shared history today, whether or not it is spoken in the moment. There may be acknowledged threads that interweave your lives that have never been discussed in detail. However, your love of adventure is currently at odds with the softer emotional component of your relationships. The haunting familiarity of the past seems more comfortable now than your drive to explore the unknown. Sometimes it's more courageous to stay fully present right in the emotional trenches where you are than going off in search of something sparkly and new."
capricorn,2015-07-13,"You might pull your hair out today if you have to hear even one more person whining about his or her hurt feelings. It's not that you are lacking in compassion, there's just more important things to do now than listen to others complain about their personal dramas. The bottom line is that you intend to have something tangible by the end of the day to show for your efforts. But don't be so quick to dismiss the real treasure you can harvest from the non-rational realms of your imagination. All head and no heart leaves you emotionally disconnected from the people that matter most."
aquarius,2015-07-13,"Finding and sustaining your rhythm is more of a challenge than you have time for today. Part of the problem is that you might not be certain about what others expect from you. Additionally, you're not even clear about your own needs. However, you aren't quite ready to throw your hands up in the air and do whatever the majority wants. Nevertheless, you're still better off trusting your intuition now than trying to map out all the logistics. Sometimes the most practical course of action arrives in the least practical manner."
pisces,2015-07-13,"Just when you finally find your groove, one more distraction pops up to interfere with your well-intended productivity. You wouldn't mind it so much if the interruptions were worthy of your attention rather than whimsical indulgences. However, it's as if reality is sideswiping you with irrelevant events just to test your powers of concentration. Although your creative imagination offers plenty of inspiration, don't just succumb to wandering in your dreams today; walk between both the mundane and the magical worlds for the best results."
aries,2015-07-14,"It might feel as if someone stole your wallet or broke your heart today. Or perhaps you're the one who is raining on someone else's parade by withholding affection. You may be experiencing a sense of loss if you think you're coming up short in the money or love department. However dissatisfied you are with your current circumstances, there is a silver lining to the dark cloud above you as you learn to temporarily get by with less. Keep the faith; your clarity will enable you to define what you truly want once the blue skies return."
taurus,2015-07-14,"The people who you think know you the best don't seem to understand you at all today. To make matters worse, the harder you try to explain your feelings, the more distance you create. Instead of rushing to bridge the gulf, calmly accept the space that has appeared between you and a loved one. A healthy relationship has its own rhythm of expansion and contraction, like the breath. Instead of trying to control this process, just observe it. There's no need to push for resolution now; simply allow the emotional tide to ebb and flow at its own natural pace."
gemini,2015-07-14,"Too many chores on your to-do list prevent you from getting closer to your loved ones today. You don't have the luxury of engaging in open-ended conversations about your feelings. The issues you want to explore must be postponed to another time. Instead of pining over what you don't have now, let it go. Focusing on the lack of heart connection only spirals you into loneliness. Concentrate on what you can do to raise your game when it comes to relationships. Upgrading your emotional quotient will improve your interactions with people once repressive Saturn moves out of the way."
cancer,2015-07-14,"Although you often like to maintain a fairly low profile, you want others to stand up and take notice of you today. Unfortunately, it may seem as if you can't get the respect you think you deserve, no matter how awesome your work is now. Don't let anyone shake your confidence; if you know you're doing your best, just let the criticism roll off you like water off a duck's back. The truth is self-esteem comes from within and not from others."
leo,2015-07-14,"Love's sweet indulgences are on your mind, but grumpy Saturn has a different plan for your day. Expressing your passion doesn't work its usual magic today. Unfortunately, laying on the charm won't affect others if they are already entrenched in a serious mindset. You're ready to put on a show, but you're quick to pack your bags and head home if there's no audience to appreciate your performance. Nevertheless, don't make the mistake of believing it's an all-or-nothing deal when the lesson is about scaling back your expectations. Work now, play later."
virgo,2015-07-14,"You might keep your romantic dreams to yourself now if you believe they will never come true. Meanwhile, your friends contribute in their own way to your current sense of isolation without even knowing it. Although you may interact with others socially, it seems as if they're having trouble seeing the real you. Your lack of communication could inadvertently fuel the tension. Obviously, sharing your heart is scary because it exposes your vulnerability. However, communicating your feelings is the antidote to the victim mentality you may find yourself susceptible to. Self-empowerment begins with self-expression."
libra,2015-07-14,"You can't seem to please your boss or your coworkers today no matter what you do. Although this discord would usually bother you enough to turn your self-confidence into self-doubt, you currently have a much more straightforward response in mind. You just want to wish everyone luck and go home. Naturally, you would prefer for others to appreciate your efforts, but you're not going to make peace now even if you try. Let others be annoyed with you if they must but don't let their opinions bring you down."
scorpio,2015-07-14,"Money may be tight these days and romance is nowhere to be found. However, these stressful circumstances are not valid reasons to give up and hide under the covers. Instead of wasting precious time feeling sorry for yourself, reevaluate the ways you can improve your current fiscal situation and upgrade your relationship life. Quit worrying about everyone else and just focus on striving to be the best version of you possible. The love you need to cultivate is the love for yourself."
sagittarius,2015-07-14,"The secrets you keep buried have more influence now that vulnerable Venus is squaring austere Saturn in your 12th House of Privacy. It seems as if reality can't live up to your fantasies now no matter what you do. You might even feel like your dreams are being squashed for no reason. However, your frustration will lessen when you stop trying to make your life as perfect as it is in your imagination. Graciously accepting the difference between your inner world and the external circumstances puts you back on the road to gratitude and harmony."
capricorn,2015-07-14,"It's hard to read people because their behavior is unpredictable and their expression inscrutable. In fact, the more questions you ask, the more they clam up while four planets are hanging out in self-protective Cancer and your 7th House of Companions. Although your gentle persistence could surprisingly bring positive results, you'll never know if you surrender too soon. There is a delicate dance between being overly demanding and just shrugging your shoulders and walking away. Finding that sweet spot turns your frustration into success."
aquarius,2015-07-14,"You have to be a worker bee today when you would rather be a social butterfly. You may feel as if you're the only one who has to meet a demanding production schedule, but the truth of the matter is everyone -- you included -- must contribute to the greater good. Unfortunately, you might have to move personal relationships to the back burner temporarily while you take care of urgent matters of business now. Responsibility is a matter of integrity."
pisces,2015-07-14,Producing tangible results needs to be your top priority today. You don't have much leeway now; you're expected to be highly responsive to pressing issues in the real world even though you would prefer to spend the day pushing the boundaries of your imagination. Don't wait to see what drama waits in the wings to release the unexpected tension; pull in the reins immediately before uncomfortable events do it for you. You're not all airy-fairy and this is your chance to prove it.
aries,2015-07-15,"Although profound resistance to your plans can stop you in your tracks today, don't give up on a good idea just because someone tells you it has no merit. If you don't understand why you are running into trouble, stop and listen carefully to the message of the Cancer New Moon as it floods your 4th House of Security. Obstacles are more easily handled once you accept that your current fear of change is unwarranted. Ironically, it's less important to reach your destination now than it is to fine-tune your plans. Safety comes first."
taurus,2015-07-15,"Although you probably have a overcrowded calendar while the Cancer New Moon rocks your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, it's still tough to shift into gear. At first, you're tempted to get by with doing less but your energy builds steam throughout the day, enabling you to overcome  anything that stands in your path once you find your pace. Just remember you're not the only person with an ambitious agenda and intriguing ideas. Staying open to new information from a variety of sources can dramatically change your perspective and increase your options."
gemini,2015-07-15,"It's all too easy to waste time running around in circles just trying to keep up with the hectic pace of events. But unless you slow down and reconnect with your core values today you may not feel satisfied with your objectives while the Cancer New Moon emphasizes your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Proceed with caution now; taking time for contemplation should not be thought of as a retreat. In fact, you could jeopardize your success if you continue to move too fast. Remember, reaching your goals is more like a marathon than a sprint."
cancer,2015-07-15,"The emotional New Moon in your sign is an early warning sign of an energetic shift that's unfolding at home or within your family. You might choose to hide your head in the sand, only to be shocked by what happens. Or, perhaps you're trying to co-create your future by living the change you seek. Start by creating a list of resolutions, as if today is New Year's Day. Focusing your positive intentions during the New Moon plants significant seeds of thought in your fertile imagination."
leo,2015-07-15,"Today's Cancer New Moon is a fresh start, but this new beginning falls in your 12th House of Endings, revealing an ironic blending of two cycles. But beginning a new phase prior to completing old business can be extremely problematic for everyone involved. Allow the current process to play out naturally or you might miss your chance to get the closure you need. Your best bet is to stay aware of the relationship between what you are finishing and what you hope to do next."
virgo,2015-07-15,"You may feel uncomfortably isolated while the moody Cancer New Moon shakes up your 11th House of Community. People that you can usually count on are nowhere to be found when you go searching for advice today. Thankfully, your real friends will come through in the nick of time with the support that you need. But don't draw conclusions prematurely; give others the benefit of the doubt instead of assuming the worst."
libra,2015-07-15,"You may feel pressured to make a career move today as the Cancer New Moon highlights your 10th House of Career. But a relatively minor family crisis might add stress to your day, especially if you're already involved in a disagreement with another family member. You won't be happy if someone tries to take control of the situation now, but you should heed their advice, nonetheless. Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater; be astute enough to show your ability to discern what's useful from what is not."
scorpio,2015-07-15,"Building emotional continuity in your life is an admirable goal, but it may come with a component of drama now that the moody Cancer New Moon stirs up trouble in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You may be happy to know who you are and where you are heading. But your drive can be so intense now that you feel compelled to stand up for your beliefs. Tread carefully, for you could inadvertently provoke a conflict by resorting to aggressive behavior. Instead, channel your passion into physical activities instead."
sagittarius,2015-07-15,"You might be unsure about your evolving direction because the Cancer New Moon rattles your 8th House of Transformation, evoking a sense of discomfort by pushing you to explore feelings that you would rather forget. Don't belittle a friend's melodrama by judging it so trivial that you don't have to get involved. Your willingness to partake in a meaningful dialogue may be exactly what's required to take a relationship to a new level of intimacy."
capricorn,2015-07-15,"An overly emotional interaction with a friend or partner reveals that he or she has more to tell you now than you previously thought. There may be a suppressed issue lurking in the background as the Cancer New Moon occurs in your 7th House of Relationships. Unfortunately, you might not know what to do about the imbalance. Direct confrontation could make matters worse. But letting it slide ends up contributing to the negative energy. The conversation will be awkward at first, but you can make a positive difference if you talk about your uneasiness without blaming anyone else."
aquarius,2015-07-15,"You aren't necessarily aware of harboring any resentments about your job, but it's not that simple to let go of an unresolved hurt. Fortunately, you have a pretty good grasp of the source of your current negativity if you are willing to be honest. The Cancer New Moon's presence in your 6th House of Logistics gives you a clear picture of what you must do next. Be open to receiving emotional support from people who have your best interests at heart. Leaning on loved ones gives you the strength to process your feelings and get on with the real work at hand."
pisces,2015-07-15,You can finally stand and hold your ground after an extended period of uncertainty. But your feelings are more complex than they seem on the surface now that the cautious Cancer New Moon lands in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Don't overcompensate with false bravado; there's no logical justification for flaunting your victory. Nothing is gained by creating a competitive environment where others are threatened by your success. Softening your stance helps to relieve tension and return harmony back to your relationship world.
aries,2015-07-16,"You're waiting for someone to say the wrong word today so you can pounce on them in defense of your position. You're probably unaware of your true motives; you're not even conscious of how intense you sound now. Although you are more bark than bite, people still might take your intensity at face value. There's little to gain by protecting your boundaries from imaginary enemies. Lowering your voice and letting others speak is a simple yet straightforward way to realign the tense dynamics. Take a deep breath and count to ten before you act in anger."
taurus,2015-07-16,"It feels like your loved ones are pushing your buttons today just to see how far they can go before you push back. It seems like it's one thing after another and you are overwhelmed with all their demands on your time. At first, you're eager to demonstrate your good will by rearranging your schedule, but it probably won't be enough to satisfy everyone. But even the most easygoing of Bulls have their limits and you may soon reach your boiling point. Although you just want to reclaim your personal space, you might have to make a big commotion to get others to notice. Speak softly and carry a big stick."
gemini,2015-07-16,"Subjectivity rules the day. You and a friend or loved one may find it difficult to find common ground in a disagreement over a difference in values. Your two positions couldn't be more opposite today and finding points of understanding may end up being an exercise in futility. The most direct route to creating resolution might be going your separate ways for a while. Walking away takes courage but it's an integral part of the peace process now. Above all, be kind in all your words and deeds or you will have a wider gulf to cross down the road."
cancer,2015-07-16,"There isn't even a split second between your thoughts and your reactions today. Being so fast on your feet might be advantageous in a crisis situation but could be problematic for relationships. You might do something foolish before you think about the impact of your behavior. It may sound impossible to do now, but you must stop and reevaluate your present situation before you speak or act in a way you will soon regret. Don't snap at the ones who care the most."
leo,2015-07-16,"You can take a simple comment from someone at work today and turn it into a soap opera melodrama. Unfortunately, you're not processing your thoughts now; you're just blindly reacting from a place of fear or pride. Don't bite someone's head off if he or she just asks you a simple question. Starting the day off with a bit of self-reflection through meditation, yoga or prayer might bring you enough awareness to move through the day with grace and gratitude. Keep the roar to a minimum and you should be fine."
virgo,2015-07-16,"You Virgos know quite a bit about self-sufficiency and your survival skills may be put to the test today. Paradoxically, you could feel the loneliest when you're in the midst of a crowded event or a group of friends. However, you might be better off spending time alone and doing things that further your spiritual path. Looking to others for a solution only adds unnecessary stress to your relationships when what you really need now comes from within. Personal growth is a journey you must do alone."
libra,2015-07-16,"On the surface it appears that you're just another member of the group, however, you might actually be subtly pulling all the strings. Others don't even realize you're the master puppeteer behind the scenes. Just be careful that you don't get so enamored with being in control that you forget the plot. Your priorities may need sorting out today, but everything will be alright if you remember the collective cause is more important now than your personal dreams. Participating in the show instead of trying to run it increases your chances of being on the winning team."
scorpio,2015-07-16,"Your own special version of honesty may be too much for most people to handle today. Even if your intentions are well-meaning, you might harm more than help if you speak before you think. Maintaining a safe distance from others until your blood is no longer boiling seems like a sensible way to minimize collateral damage. However, burying your feelings is an invitation to disaster because they will gain power and inconveniently express, anyhow. Your real work isn't about changing your message; it's about increasing your awareness. It's easy to criticize someone else, raise the bar and improve your game, instead."
sagittarius,2015-07-16,"Placing your dreams of adventure temporarily on hold may be necessary today because there are the needs of others to take in consideration, too. Unfortunately, another person's dependence on you is in direct conflict with your current yearning for freedom. You don't like the fact that you can't just run off and follow your bliss. Although you value your independence, you're willing to accept your current position of accountability to maintain healthy relationships. Try an empathetic approach by putting yourself in someone else's shoes before taking a hike in your own."
capricorn,2015-07-16,"You want to buckle down and take care of business today, but everyone seems to have their own tale to tell. Obviously, you have a personal agenda as well, but your priorities are different than everyone else's. The bottom line is you don't have the patience to deal with people's trivial concerns when there's serious work to be done. In the most diplomatic manner possible, inform everyone that success must be earned and there's no time like the present to get busy. Leading by example is the best way to get your message across."
aquarius,2015-07-16,"There's no denying that you have a lot of chores on your plate today. Paradoxically, the more you accomplish, the more there is to do. No matter how hard you work, people expect more. To make matters worse, you can't seem to concentrate now as you continue to float off into inner space. Although you might not be able to prevent drifting in and out of focus, you could capitalize on your imagination by applying a splash of creativity to your daily routine. A little change will do you good."
pisces,2015-07-16,"You're having trouble fitting in with the group today and you're not even sure you want to try. You feel the need to resist the peer pressure to conform because you don't want to lose your creative edge. But don't be afraid to take a risk and try a whole new strategy. You might get away with pacifying others, so do whatever you can to accommodate their wishes as long as it doesn't compromise your beliefs. If everyone sees you as a valuable member of the team, you'll end up having plenty of latitude to express yourself in your own unique manner."
aries,2015-07-17,"You might receive a rude awakening if you think your past accomplishments will be enough to let you slide by without having to do much real work today. It's true that wishful thinking can be a very effective tool for self-motivation but, unfortunately, your current confidence isn't necessarily based on reality. Creating a best-case scenario in your imagination won't automatically improve your life. Instead of resting on your laurels, visualize the potential at stake now and invest the sweat equity required to make something special happen. You reap what you sow."
taurus,2015-07-17,"You want to be a valuable team player today at work or in your community, but your sweet dreams of cooperation and harmony might be too good to be true. At the slightest sign of discord you're tempted to make a hasty retreat, but running back to your safety zone is just another illusion. Avoid disappointment by relaxing your expectations. Facing reality and accepting it just as it is empowers you to get the most out of the group experience. Being authentic in all your actions sets an example for others to follow."
gemini,2015-07-17,"You might act as if you know what you're doing today, but unbeknownst to others you're lost in your own thoughts. Your current lack of direction may be at the root of your confusion. Instead of pretending like you have all the answers now, admit what you don't know so you can focus on what you do know. Revealing your vulnerability is not a sign of weakness; it takes strength to show up as a human, complete with your imperfections. Success is closer than you think if you remain honest with yourself."
cancer,2015-07-17,"You believe that today's uncertainty will surely lead to tomorrow's success story, but you're not yet sure of the details. Your imagination is working overtime to color in the missing parts of the picture, but you would be better off filling in the gaps with the truth rather than with some pretty fantasy. Steer clear of pie-in-the-sky optimism for it won't lead you in the right direction. Instead, play it safe now and stick to the facts for the best results."
leo,2015-07-17,"You're acutely aware that you are not in charge of other people's feelings. In fact, you don't even seem to be in charge of your own now. Your heart is like a pendulum while the moody Moon holds court in your sign, making it nearly impossible to maintain your course. Just as you think you're making progress, you start to second-guess an earlier assumption. But self-doubt is not a fruitful path. Your emotions are in transition and making final decisions is futile until you regain your bearings. Give yourself some breathing room until the fog lifts and your confidence returns."
virgo,2015-07-17,"You are feeling the need to be nurtured by your co workers or social network, but you're afraid of losing your identity in the crowd. Luckily, maintaining your own direction while also benefiting from a larger collaboration is easier than you might expect. Bring your creative ideas to the group process rather than hoarding them for yourself. Your concerns about losing your independence will vanish if you set clear boundaries right from the start. People can't dim your sparkle unless you let them."
libra,2015-07-17,"You can't see very far down your current career path now, complicating major decisions you need to make at work. It's challenging to establish rational priorities when your logic is so warped by your feelings. The chores you have on your agenda today might actually be less important than the ones you're delaying. It could take a few more days to sort things out, but your clear-eyed objectivity will return and you'll be able to pick up the pieces where you left them."
scorpio,2015-07-17,"Although your originality is apparent, integrating your creativity into your work can be quite a dilemma today. You have no trouble imagining all the colors and the sounds, but you can't figure out how the elements all fit together. You're currently living in two different worlds and the dissonance can be intense as your dreams resist the structure of the three-dimensional realm. Don't try so hard to finish your next masterpiece; generating new inspiration is enough for now."
sagittarius,2015-07-17,"There are many wonderful opportunities on the horizon, but the weight of the world seems to be on your shoulders today. You have great ideas and high hopes, but might feel frustrated if you can't get off the ground because you're unable to see through the fog. It's enough to take the wind out of your sails. You just might want to go home, crawl into bed and pull the covers over your head. The possibilities are too good to pass up now, so fight the impulse to indulge in self-pity. Have faith; spread your wings and fly."
capricorn,2015-07-17,"Interpersonal dynamics may be the cause of serious angst today. You're doing your best to make sense of what others want, but you still fall short of your goal. No matter how hard you try, you're not connecting emotionally with those you love. Although relationships are difficult to navigate now, it's possible to break through the confusion by reducing the pressure to be understood. If there's a gap between what you say and what others hear, don't go back to clarify your intent. Let your message marinate for a while before you try again with a fresh approach."
aquarius,2015-07-17,"You can gather all the facts you want, but you're still not going to get to the bottom of an issue today. Your search for answers will likely come up empty-handed with elusive Neptune blurring the planetary picture. Your unwavering hope is that someone will arrive on the scene with a brilliant plan at the very last moment. However, you could set yourself up for disappointment if you're waiting for a miracle. Focus on obtaining practical results from your current efforts without worrying about the outcome. Mysteries have a way of solving themselves when no one is looking."
pisces,2015-07-17,"You could be fooling yourself into believing that your heart is steering you in the right direction now. You might even spin a few stories if you think they could justify your irrational behavior. Normally your intuition is the first place you go to find answers. However, it's wise to stick to the three-dimensional world when seeking solutions today. Allow your imagination to run wild but treat it more like an entertaining movie than an oracle. Go against your nature and let common sense be your guide for a change."
aries,2015-07-18,"You thrive on the unpredictable nature of the day as mischievous Mercury spars with unorthodox Uranus. Your love of spontaneity works well with the current uncertainty since circumstances can suddenly shift without warning. Thankfully, an electric burst of energy could send shockwaves through your romantic life that start your heart rocking and rolling again. Don't let pride stand in your way. Tell others exactly what you want today; you have no idea what magic is possible unless you try."
taurus,2015-07-18,"You're more nervous than others might suspect today, but you're a natural at keeping your stress under wraps. Your nonchalance may be based on your clever ability to compartmentalize different aspects of your life. Nevertheless, hiding your doubts now isn't as easy as it sounds, but you might choose to minimize your concerns for the sake of those you love. However, you need to confide in someone you trust or find a way to release some steam before you blow your cover. Thankfully, you're more comfortable with your feelings tonight after Venus and the Moon shift into virtuous Virgo."
gemini,2015-07-18,"You love the intellectual stimulation that cerebral Mercury brings to the table today. However, getting your ideas out into the open is much trickier than it seems at first. Perhaps you're overly concerned that your remarks might seem out of context or could be taken the wrong way. But your nagging worries won't ultimately stop you from talking because you chatty Geminis can't stay quiet for long. Paradoxically, a cautious and contemplative approach to communication now enables you to say more in the long run. Listen as much as you speak and you will learn as much as you teach."
cancer,2015-07-18,"Your emotions are running amok today and you can't seem to get a handle on what surprise may be lurking around the next corner. On one hand, you're anticipating the potential excitement but on the other hand, you're also dreading the unknown. Don't take things so personally; make the most of the current instability by leading with your sense of humor rather than your hypersensitivity. Luckily, your resilience is your saving grace."
leo,2015-07-18,"You can feel a disturbance in the Force today as magnetic Venus and the Moon exit your sign for the more emotionally reserved fields of Virgo. But even you fun-loving Lions need to take a break from the action now and then to catch your breath. This temporary lull is a blessing in disguise, since it offers you a rare chance to recharge your batteries and to prepare for the next round of engagement. If you can escape your obligations, it's a perfect day for a catnap in the Sun."
virgo,2015-07-18,"Skip the second cup of coffee today because the nervous Mercury-Uranus square already makes you feel as if you're jumping out of your skin. Although you could have a heavy load of chores to do today, your thoughts are so scattered that you don't know where to begin. However, it's not all bad news; you might be relieved because you can sense that a welcome change is in the air. You just need to get through the initial transition before you're able to settle into a productive rhythm."
libra,2015-07-18,"You might have been planning on a day of peace and quiet, but someone may show up unannounced to drop all their drama on your doorstep. Although you wish you had the strength of self-preservation to turn them away today, you're such a good friend that you shake your head and let them in anyway. Remember, there are limits to being a caring friend, especially when nurturing yourself is as important now as being a sounding board for others. You have to take care of yourself before you can care for others."
scorpio,2015-07-18,"Even the best-laid plans can go awry today through no fault of your own. It's as if there are secret traps waiting in unsuspecting places. Naturally, the least stressful course of action is to laugh and remember your infinitesimally small place in such a vast universe. The disproportionate extremes are shocking enough to awaken you from your sleep. Discerning what you can control from what you can't is the first step to regaining your sense of balance."
sagittarius,2015-07-18,"Your enthusiasm only carries you so far today, especially when you realize just how much time and energy it will take to reach your destination. Unfortunately, your biggest and boldest ideas could run into a wall of reality, requiring you to totally reassess your strategy. Nevertheless, your thoughts seem to have a life of their own and won't necessarily evaporate just because you think it would be more convenient if they left you alone. Keeping one foot solidly on the ground empowers you to make the most of your visions without being swept away by them in the process."
capricorn,2015-07-18,"Someone's eccentric behavior drives you nuts today, but you might bite your tongue and refrain from sharing your opinion. Thankfully, you have the good sense not to stir the energy up even more since you know it won't make a difference. Your lesson now is about practicing tolerance and allowing others to express themselves in ways that are alien to you. Interpersonal dynamics are at play and your patience will win over hearts in the end. An open mind is a powerful mind."
aquarius,2015-07-18,"Your unconventional approach to life may be troubling to those in your immediate surroundings today. Although the cosmic high-frequency buzz fuels your adrenaline, your hyperactivity is probably a tad annoying to others. Nevertheless, you don't want to lose your audience now; you only wish they could appreciate your unique brand of originality. Don't wait for others to curb your enthusiasm when all you need to do is find a healthy outlet for your energy. Taking the path less traveled makes all the difference in the world."
pisces,2015-07-18,"Your belief system may clash with someone else's today, creating an unpleasant dissonance in an otherwise harmonious relationship. In theory, you're eager to discuss your differences, but it would be a mistake to think that you'll find common ground quickly. Thankfully, you don't always need to be in agreement on every subject with those you love. Cultivating mutual respect and emotional trust deepens the heart connection more than anything else."
aries,2015-07-19,"Your Sunday routine may not include going to church, but it's a perfect day to reconnect with your spiritual path in a way that resonates with your heart. Fortunately, you won't necessarily have to go anywhere special if you take time for your own brand of worship today. Prayer comes in many shapes and sizes; you don't have to fit your practices into anyone else's religious box. As the renowned theologian Matthew Fox said, ""It doesn't matter where you dig the well. You reach the same water."""
taurus,2015-07-19,"You're basking in your element today and want nothing more than to enjoy the camaraderie of your close friends. You derive a special satisfaction from conversing about common interests with your peers and encouraging their passions. But don't let your current obsessive need for planning cause you to miss out on the fun. No matter how you throw the dice now, there are too many variables for you to control. Ultimately, the details don't matter as much when you're in the company of those you love."
gemini,2015-07-19,"You might have your mind set on organizing things around the house today. Luckily, fulfilling your goal doesn't mean you need to spend the entire day indoors clearing out closets. Think outside of the box and trade in your cleaning supplies for some yard tools. A day spent in the garden improves your environment while also allowing you to experience the joys of nature. Whether it's your yard, a volunteer pea patch or a neighbor's place, getting your hands in the dirt is a grounding experience."
cancer,2015-07-19,Friendly chit-chat at the barbecue replaces emotionally intense conversations in your perfect world today. You prefer taking a more casual and lighthearted approach with the Moon's emphasis on your 3rd House of Distractions. Your picture of an ideal afternoon includes playing games and sharing delicious food with friends and family. But life rarely behaves the way it does in your imagination and you must be wary of falling for your own illusion. Do what you do best: keep your ears open in case someone you love needs a shoulder to cry on or some motherly advice.
leo,2015-07-19,"It might seem as if you're on an extended holiday now as your phone goes strangely quiet and you feel far from the bustle of the crowd. Believe it or not, the universe is trying to tell you that rest and relaxation is your top priority today. Thankfully, you're not being judged by your accomplishments now as everyone knows you deserve this break. However, at some point there will be questions about your goals and you will need to be ready with your answers. Instead of worrying about how you might meet other people's expectations, seek insight from your intuition to create a perfect plan for your future."
virgo,2015-07-19,"Someone might try to pull the wool over your eyes but now with lucky Venus and the reflective Moon camping out in your sign, you'll likely come out smelling like a rose. There's no reason to rush any decision today just because you're being told exactly what you want to hear. Ultimately, your not-so-secret weapon is your power of discernment; you can sniff out the difference between a sales job and a genuine offer if you maintain your high standards in your vigorous search for the truth."
libra,2015-07-19,"You like the idea of going on a spiritual retreat today. In fact, something as simple as spending time in nature where you can contemplate your place in the world might do the trick. However, you could easily mix up your schedule and an errand may take longer than planned, causing you to panic when you start running behind. Remember, it's not about traveling any great physical distance or invoking a particular ritual; you can create meditative space wherever you are in the world with a few deep breaths and a prayer."
scorpio,2015-07-19,"Your intuitive nature is receiving strong signals today but your deciphering of the cosmic message could be a bit off target. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently mix up your desires with your interpretation as you bend your perceptions to match up with your dreams. There's no doubt about it, your psychic powers are on point but your logic filter isn't functioning up to par. Take careful note of what you see and hear in other dimensions, but it's best not to make radical moves when your common sense isn't available to ride to the rescue."
sagittarius,2015-07-19,"You're not content just to be among your friends today; you need to stand out from the crowd. You want people to notice your accomplishments, but they seem to be focusing on the wrong things now. However, it's not what others might miss that's currently important; your disappointment stems from your own lofty expectations. Give everyone the same latitude of expression that you would like for yourself. Show your gratitude not your criticism. Appreciation is a two-way street."
capricorn,2015-07-19,"Luxuriating in your fantasies of world travel needs to take a practical slant now if you ever want your yearning for adventure to be fulfilled. It's not emotionally satisfying to only dream of escape when you know there is so much out there waiting to be explored. What would it take for you to actually embark on the journey of your lifetime? You don't have to book any reservations today, but researching all the possibilities in a pragmatic manner is an ideal first step to making your dreams come true."
aquarius,2015-07-19,"You're swimming in unfriendly waters today and might suddenly feel as if you have no air to breathe. It seems like your current circumstances are stifling your emotional expression and you don't know how to shift the energy. Thankfully, reality is more than a conceptual puzzle for you to solve. Sometimes sinking into a juicy experience without having any agenda at all reveals truths that you would otherwise miss. There is treasure to be found in the least likely of places if you are willing to keep your eyes open and look."
pisces,2015-07-19,"It's admirable to believe in the best possible outcome for those you love. But don't wear rose-colored glasses today when considering matters of the heart. In fact, it's prudent to steer clear of making long-term promises entirely while your perspective is slightly warped and wobbly. You could grow so busy making others happy now that you disregard your own needs in the process. But this is not a romance novel of someone else's creation; step out of the fairy tale and be the star of your amazing life."
aries,2015-07-20,"Sorry, Aries, you need to save your daydreaming for the night since concentrating on your work needs to be your top priority today. Spacey Neptune is like a fly in your ointment, captivating you with fascinating visions that have no practical use in the present moment. Even if you wish you could extend your weekend, it's prudent to get an early start and finish your tasks before others have a reason to complain. You might grumble a bit at first, but you will be much happier later on if you're free to pursue your dreams without worrying about chores left undone."
taurus,2015-07-20,"As long as you don't let too many distractions pull you off track today, you can take great comfort from the orderliness imposed by the meticulous Virgo Moon. You are being given an opportunity to plant your roots in the ground, setting the stage for personal growth. Although you can dream about the future in great detail, your smartest strategy now is to tend your garden in the present moment. There will be plenty of time later on to anticipate the harvest. Don't waste energy searching for greener grass when you need to be doing the hard work that's right beneath your feet."
gemini,2015-07-20,"You might have a precise plan to achieve today's objectives, but a misunderstanding at work leads to confusion about your next task. Asking others for their input is tricky business because they are not giving you much information to go on. It's as if they want you to figure out everything on your own. Fortunately, you don't really need anyone to tell you what to do because you have a secret weapon at your disposal now. If you sit still and quiet your mind, your inner voice of intuition will offer you the solution in a moment of brilliant clarity. Sometimes wisdom comes from within."
cancer,2015-07-20,"Your cautious approach to the future often saves you from landing in trouble. However, coyly playing games while deciding what to disclose and what to withhold sends mixed signals today. People don't know how to respond when they can't figure out your intentions. However, sharing your concerns can widen your perspective if you're open to the feedback you receive. Others won't be blindsided by your actions if they are involved in your process from the start. Delay committing to a final plan until you've weighed and balanced all the alternatives alongside all the consequences. Better safe than sorry."
leo,2015-07-20,"People might think there's something wrong just because you're not acting like your extroverted self these days. However, nothing could be further from the truth even if you can't be coaxed out of your lair today. Although you're known for your social prowess, you need time alone to recuperate from last month's dramas and celebrations. Tell others it's their turn to shine now but not to worry; your star will soon return to burn even brighter than before."
virgo,2015-07-20,"It's nearly impossible to be efficient when you believe you're not getting the full story. It's as if people are keeping you out of the loop because they don't want to distract you from your work. However, your concentration wavers if you start to think that you don't know the whole truth. Stop obsessing; you can do your best work now by shifting your focus inward without worrying about anyone else. Paradoxically, your self-reliance deepens the bonds between you and your peers when they realize your determination is golden."
libra,2015-07-20,"You're all business today and aren't interested in sharing your feelings with anyone. Because you're naturally so susceptible to the well-being of others, you're afraid of opening the proverbial emotional door while the evocative Moon is hiding out in your 12th House of Privacy. Unfortunately, your coworkers might take your aloofness personally, wondering what they did wrong. But your need for personal space isn't up for discussion; you just don't want to show your vulnerability now. Keep your nose to the grindstone and let people judge you for your actions rather than your words."
scorpio,2015-07-20,"You prefer to keep what's most important to yourself unless you're talking with someone who can truly understand your passion. As much as you long for the support of your peers, you're tentative when it comes to sharing your creative urges now because you're afraid that someone might belittle your ideas. The solution to your dilemma is not to go quiet; the key is to find the right person to confide in today. Connecting with like-minded souls who are walking similar paths empowers you to move mountains on your way to manifesting your dreams."
sagittarius,2015-07-20,"You're mysteriously attracted to the very same things you might normally avoid. You often gravitate toward blue sky and bright sunshine, but now you might be spellbound by anything that is hidden in the shadows. Even if you're usually afraid of the dark, you're fascinated by what you might find there today. Gather your courage and trade in your airline tickets for some psychological scuba gear. If you are willing to do some emotional diving, there is sunken treasure waiting to be discovered by your adventurous soul."
capricorn,2015-07-20,"Responsibility is relentlessly calling, demanding that you put your plans for the future on temporary hold while you manage a minor relationship crisis today. Although you're bewildered by the emotional dynamics, you probably recognize that it will be a much simpler affair to handle the situation now before it festers into something ugly. Nevertheless, your dreams won't go away just because you are busy putting out fires. Thankfully, reshuffling your priorities might be the trick that allows you to balance all the variables in your life."
aquarius,2015-07-20,"There's no reason to engage in a power struggle over allocating resources now, even if you're worried about completing a big project. Instead of wasting precious time in a petty dispute over things you can't control, just continue to work diligently and keep your mouth shut for the sake of harmony. Thankfully, it's not difficult to acquiesce on the details because you're already thinking about the bigger fish that must be fried later on. Nothing will be gained by allowing anyone to redirect your focus today. Keep your eye on the prize and everything will turn out fine."
pisces,2015-07-20,"Everyone seems to be in a more serious mood than you today, but it's probably not in your best interest to rock the boat. Unfortunately, you could work yourself into a state of frustration if you try to share your playful creativity with the world. Nevertheless, it's still prudent to follow the low-key tone set by others so as not to ruffle any feathers. Happily, respecting people's need for peace and quiet doesn't have to detract from your enthusiasm. You can still sing your song without shouting it from the rooftops."
aries,2015-07-21,"You're willing to work extra hard today in order to solidify your recent progress. Nevertheless, it's nearly impossible to completely override your natural tendency to rush into action. However, your impatience could jeopardize all that you have gained. Maintain a methodical pace and execute the proper follow-through to reach your goals. You don't have to gamble with your future now if you plan your course of action without expecting to change everything all at once. It may be a bitter pill to swallow at first, but sometimes slow and steady wins the race."
taurus,2015-07-21,"Your schedule is stretched to the limit today, yet your relentless drive might prevent you from scaling back your activities. You don't mind constructive criticism from a friend or partner, but it may seem as if encouragement is hard to find now. It's helpful to set firm boundaries if you are encountering resistance from others. Don't let anyone rain on your parade if you believe it's your turn to bask in the sunshine. Ultimately, it's up to you to prove everyone wrong; your actions will speak louder than their words."
gemini,2015-07-21,"Although you may still be harboring fantasies about new ways to make money, it's time to turn your schemes into reality today. Innovative ideas sound good at first, but now you must execute a sound business plan to be successful. Thankfully, you can exert more control over your future once you realize the importance of practicing self-discipline. Rather than letting your imagination run wild, concentrate on achieving one worthwhile goal. You can accomplish more than you think once you wholeheartedly commit to focus your mental superpowers in one direction. Willpower is the magic ingredient necessary for your success."
cancer,2015-07-21,"You can't afford to drift off into space today if you have already made prior commitments. Even if you're having a tough time remaining focused, you can deliver on your current promises when you truly believe your goals are worth pursuing. Avoid the temptation to daydream; it's more productive to keep yourself grounded in reality so you don't have to pay the cost later on. Fulfilling your previous obligations now paves the way to your future success."
leo,2015-07-21,"Achieving your objectives requires unwavering determination, but it's best to downsize your fantasies if you want them to come true. There's no point in exhausting yourself by aspiring toward unrealistic goals, but that doesn't mean you should surrender your dreams; in fact, just the opposite. Instead, search for a middle path that allows you to honor your lofty aspirations while taking a pragmatic approach to your success. Balance may be elusive today, but dogged persistence moves you steadily in the right direction. Fortunately, compromise is possible without giving up what matters most."
virgo,2015-07-21,"You have plenty of responsibilities on your plate now and may be feeling nervous if you are behind in delivering on your promises. Thankfully, your anxiety will begin to fade once you start crossing things off your to-do list. The same chores that seemed overwhelming yesterday are a piece of cake now. Eliminate extraneous activities and concentrate your efforts where they will have the greatest impact. If you set your mind to something and then apply yourself with unwavering commitment, you can accomplish nearly anything you want. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
libra,2015-07-21,"Although you have been sitting on the fence for a few days, you're ready to make a big decision today. Libras are known for vacillating at times because they're naturally adept at tempering extreme ideas and finding common ground. However, you see the handwriting on the wall and are eager to choose one direction now. It's more important to be swift in judgment than to be perfect. Thankfully, you will still have the chance to adjust your trajectory as your perspective continues to evolve. Seize the cosmic moment and embrace your future."
scorpio,2015-07-21,"You may be recycling the same thoughts around in your mind over and over again, trying to reach a different conclusion. But you probably won't reveal your inner process because you believe others won't understand your current plight. Talking about your concerns is not the quickest route to happiness; you must take direct action now. Fortunately, you will be happily surprised with the support you receive if you simply settle down and channel your angst into your work. Putting in extra effort brings positive results faster than you expect. Procrastination is no longer a luxury you can afford."
sagittarius,2015-07-21,"There are many paths in front of you at this time; but ultimately, it's up to you to choose one and stick with it. Unfortunately, you might be carrying some unnecessary emotional baggage and pushing through your own resistance is your only viable option now. Luckily, someone may give you a chance to demonstrate a new and improved version of you. However, you must take the initiative by surrounding yourself with open-minded people who can help you process your feelings. Your future shines brightly if you are willing to do the work."
capricorn,2015-07-21,"Although everyone assumes you're open to feedback when it comes to your future, your convictions are stronger than anyone realizes now. You are singularly focused on your long-term plans, even if others are telling you to pay attention to the current dynamics. However, you may think that your friends are just making matters worse by distracting you with their opinions today. Fortunately, you have the necessary tools to stay on the straight and narrow path and it's up to you to use them. Keep your eyes on the distant horizon and relentlessly inch your way to success."
aquarius,2015-07-21,"You may feel as if you didn't make any progress on the job yesterday, but thankfully, you get to make up for lost time today. There's less resistance now as you push toward your goals, motivating you to raise your level of productivity. But don't spread your resources too thin; you will be more effective if you concentrate on one single goal at a time. Instead of struggling to finish all your work, prioritize your tasks before rolling up your sleeves and getting down to business. Approaching the day in a logical manner maximizes your efforts more than you might think."
pisces,2015-07-21,"Your concerns about your future plans could grow more serious today, prompting you to make an overdue decision. But every little problem seems to be tied to larger issues and there's no way to avoid the bigger picture. Bring your shovel and be prepared to dig your way to the bottom, if necessary. There's no reason to rush the process; it's your own psychological pressure that creates this false sense of urgency. Slowing down allows you to explore the various alternatives and choose the best route to your long-term success."
aries,2015-07-22,"You might try a more cautious approach to sharing your feelings today, but you could be stressing over the wrong things. Instead of wasting time trying to guess how others will react to your emotional disclosure, just let the cards fall where they may. Your impatience can interfere with whatever stability you have already gained. But even if you feel stuck with no clear direction, there's no need to force progress now. Relationship dynamics will make more sense soon enough if you can relax your expectations and enjoy the present moment."
taurus,2015-07-22,You have very specific ideas about how your day should unfold but you may not be able to stick to your initial plan if you want to play nicely with others. Managing your schedule is impossible when people keep changing their minds about the activities that include you today. But you can't just take all your toys and go home because you might need to provide a strong shoulder for someone to lean on when things get dicey. It's pointless to push your personal agenda now; you have a lot to learn and plenty to offer by going along with the flow.
gemini,2015-07-22,"You may not feel like revealing too many details today, even if you know exactly what you want. Keeping quiet seems like your best option since you're afraid that others might not agree with your position. It's likely that your intuition is on point now because your coworkers don't understand your current motives. Thankfully, you won't have to respond to questions you prefer not to answer if you don't give too much information away in the first place. Focusing on someone else's needs is a clever deflection because it allows you to play the role of a supportive friend while also conveniently taking the bright light off of you."
cancer,2015-07-22,"Although acting more spontaneously sounds like a wonderful idea in theory, you might not enjoy the experience if you're worried about the criticism you could receive for your behavior. You feel emotionally exposed now as if others already know your desires, even if you haven't uttered a word. However, your fear of disapproval can be a problem if you're monitoring everything you say and do. One way to reduce your current stress is to practice unconditional self-acceptance. Ultimately, those who matter will respect you as long as you're being true to yourself. Authenticity counts."
leo,2015-07-22,"Your imagination continues to run rampant with three planets clustered in your 12th House of Fantasy. However, drama is simmering in your real life and you could be pulled into an emotionally charged conversation with a close friend or relative now. Although you prefer to keep your feelings private today, you won't be able to stay out of the spotlight for much longer. Nevertheless, use your downtime to figure out what your heart wants so you are ready to handle the delicate relationship issues that pop up in the days ahead. Forewarned is forearmed."
virgo,2015-07-22,"You can't help but be nervous about sharing your goals with your associates, but exercising too much hesitation today could cause you to miss an exciting opportunity. You might shy away from casual conversations or even turn down a social invitation if it doesn't align with your agenda. Although making a hasty retreat isn't necessarily wise now, neither is responding too quickly. Something worthwhile will likely withstand the test of time, so waiting a day or two before making a final decision ultimately works in your favor."
libra,2015-07-22,"You often go out of your way to balance your needs with others since maintaining peace and harmony is key to your relationship success. You might even choose to keep some of your preferences to yourself because you don't want to disturb the status quo. You may have a specific destination in mind today, yet you're reluctant to say anything because you don't have the logistics in place. Don't worry about the details now; just be clear about your objectives with the understanding that satisfaction could still take a while to reach. Honesty is the best policy, especially with yourself."
scorpio,2015-07-22,"You have been reconsidering your long-term goals ever since solemn Saturn retrograded into your sign last month. Even if you're anticipating the future, today's Mercury-Saturn trine requires you to stop and review your past to better understand your current feelings. You may worry that you can't actualize your ambitious plans, but your caution could turn into self-doubt if you overanalyze every move. Do yourself a favor now; don't assume the worst-case scenario or that might be what you manifest. Rest assured that your lost confidence will return; it's just a game of mind over matter."
sagittarius,2015-07-22,"You may not want anyone to know that you're wrestling with your doubts now, but there's no reason to fake confidence if you aren't currently feeling it. It's healthier to show more emotional restraint instead of taking something too far when you are not totally invested. Spontaneity comes naturally to you, but you benefit today from some quiet time to reassess your direction. You don't have to spill the beans if you're not in the mood; leaving some details to the imagination serves you well."
capricorn,2015-07-22,"You might not want to deal with an associate who is emotionally needy today, yet your empathy with someone else's feelings can open doors to a new level of friendship. It's worth the struggle now as you try to determine what lines to cross and how much to reveal. Of course, it's safer to play the role of the stoic friend and hide behind a wall of reason. However, avoiding your feelings could create unnecessary resistance. Lean into your fear of intimacy by being radically honest; you may be pleasantly surprised by what happens when you open your heart."
aquarius,2015-07-22,"You could be so goal oriented today that others don't know how to react to your unabashed ambition. Your emotions are uncharacteristically intense, even if you don't want to dwell on them. But any attempt to downplay your feelings creates a different set of problems as someone misinterprets your nonchalance as a sign of disinterest. Don't hold back now when it comes to expressing your dreams; go out of your way to let the ones you love know how passionately you feel about your future and their place in it."
pisces,2015-07-22,"You may be overly concerned that you have taken a relationship too far too fast and now you want to run to a place of emotional safety. Or maybe you made an inaccurate assumption about someone's feelings, creating unnecessary drama. Fortunately, with realistic Saturn in the equation today, you're committed to getting all the facts right, even if they complicate matters. There's no need to make any sudden moves. Take a few steps back from the awkward situation and give yourself enough distance to regain an objective perspective. Time is your ally."
aries,2015-07-23,"Expressing yourself honestly grows more complicated when you're concerned about protecting someone else's feelings. You're bursting at the seams today; your creativity is like a fireworks display that commands attention. You've been waiting for this moment and you want to put on a show that everyone will remember. Although you're running on sheer adrenaline and pure inspiration, you may still experience a bit of stage fright. Thankfully, your courage will outweigh any last-minute doubts. Take a few deep breaths and shine like the star you are."
taurus,2015-07-23,"Taking a sentimental journey with a loved one requires careful planning as you balance your personal desires with professional obligations. Nevertheless, you're longing to connect with a family member or someone from your past. The current planetary emphasis on your 4th House of Roots makes this a perfect time to share childhood memories, revisit old haunts and luxuriate in nostalgia. Just remember to return to the present before someone thinks you've run out on your responsibilities. Reminiscing is a lovely diversion today as long as you're not avoiding your work."
gemini,2015-07-23,"Although you might be known for your gift of gab, you can take it to a whole new level now when loquacious Mercury bumps into the Sun in your 3rd House of Information. You could strike up a conversation with nearly anyone today, but your enthusiasm may be overwhelming to your audience. Stop talking long enough to let others respond and share their stories as well. Your positivity is contagious and there is much to gain from a mutual exchange of ideas. Communication is a two-way street."
cancer,2015-07-23,"You could surprise yourself with your strong reaction if someone catches you off guard and challenges your beliefs. When push comes to shove, you resolute Crabs can put up as good a fight as anyone else. You're especially tenacious if you feel emotionally threatened in any way now. If someone so much as looks cross-eyed at a loved one today, you might overreact and put on quite a show of loyalty. Standing up for your convictions is honorable as long as you don't overplay your hand."
leo,2015-07-23,"Your star is on the rise now and you can't help but draw a captive audience wherever you go. It seems like everyone is hanging on every word you speak today, making you feel as if your entire life is a stage on which you must perform. Nevertheless, you're not ready to reveal all your talents just yet. Although you might still be holding a few tricks up your sleeve, you're on the precipice of setting the world on fire with your charisma and charm. All you need is a leap of faith to make the magic happen."
virgo,2015-07-23,"You are reluctantly dragged into the spotlight today, but you can dazzle everyone with your mental agility nonetheless. You know your message is important, but you're not sure that you're prepared to divulge all your secrets to the rest of the world. Nevertheless, you have plenty to say and you can even temporarily lose yourself in the excitement of the moment if you feel in your element. There are no rules to follow as to when you should speak your truth, so trust your intuition to tell you when the time is right."
libra,2015-07-23,"Sharing your long-term aspirations with your colleagues is key to your future success now that messenger Mercury aligns with the brilliant Sun in your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes. Luckily, you have all the cosmic support you need when communicating with your peers today. Be prepared to deliver your clever elevator pitch at a moment's notice. This is an auspicious time to go the extra mile while socially networking because you never know who you might connect with next. Turn on your legendary charm and watch what happens."
scorpio,2015-07-23,"It's easy for you to consciously compartmentalize your life and set your personal feelings aside while you engage in activities that further your career goals. You're motivated to express your perspective today, even if no one is listening at first. Whether you sit down with your boss for a brainstorming session or write up your plan to save the world, it's critical to get your ideas out in the open. Fortunately, your flair for the dramatic can create quite a buzz now, so don't miss this opportunity to be heard. The art of persuasion is your key to getting your message across."
sagittarius,2015-07-23,"You are inspired to climb up onto your soapbox and rhapsodize on the virtues of liberty and justice today. You could slip right into playing the role of a modern-day Socrates because of your natural philosophical orientation. It's perfectly fine to share your lofty ideas as long as you don't believe you're the only one who has the exclusivity on the truth. Don't suck all the oxygen out of the room. Give everyone the breathing room to respond with their opinions, too. Never forget that you can learn something valuable from every person you encounter."
capricorn,2015-07-23,"Although it might not seem like your cup of tea, you're eager to talk about intense relationship issues today. Even if sharing your feelings doesn't come naturally, you can open up now without pursuing an agenda. Of course, you don't always have to be busy vying for position at work or trying to move up in the status game. Nevertheless, you are still goal oriented in your thinking as the cerebral Mercury-Sun conjunction activates your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Love doesn't require perfection; don't let your fear of failure stand in your way when it comes to expressing your heart."
aquarius,2015-07-23,"Waiting politely for your turn to speak isn't likely to work today. In fact, your friend or partner may be talking a mile a minute while the brilliant Sun cozies up to chatty Mercury in your 7th House of Companions. You can't get a word in edgewise because others are hogging the limelight and won't even stop to catch their breath. You might have to dramatically interrupt someone's babbling stream of consciousness if you want to express your opinion on the subject at hand. Thankfully, your emotional eruption shifts the energy in your direction so your words will be taken seriously, too."
pisces,2015-07-23,"Although you're comfortable discussing your creative ideas at work today, you might be totally tongue-tied when sharing what's in your heart. Your inability to reveal your feelings is unusual; nevertheless, your current eloquence may be limited to job-related issues. However, your emotions could fester, leading you to lose your temper later on. If your verbal communication is stymied, write about your unexpressed passions in a journal or in a letter you never send. The simple act of declaring your truth relieves the internal pressure and allows you to move on."
aries,2015-07-24,"You prefer to be in full control of your fate, but you could easily spend more time responding to external situations today than manifesting your own events. You depend on people for their well-honed skills and the resources they bring to the table, but they also expect certain things in return from you. Fortunately, creating your own personal destiny is still possible as long as you take the needs of others into consideration in the process. Developing compassion enables you to maximize your potential in ways you never imagined."
taurus,2015-07-24,"You are hoping to solidify the most important relationships in your life today, but you keep falling back on your fantasies as you try to express your needs. However, people in your immediate environment might not even appear interested in making your wishes come true. But instead of slinking away to nurse your wounds, it's much more strategic to engage others from a different angle now. Your chances for gratification improve when you face the facts instead of retreating to the safety of your imagination. Remain open to the element of surprise for the best results."
gemini,2015-07-24,"You might struggle to float through the tricky currents that carry you this way and that way today. Although complex interpersonal dynamics at work seem to be out of your control, you're ready to dive in to save the day anyway. Thankfully, temporarily setting aside your personal desires enables you to deftly handle the volatility of the current situation. Postpone the important discussions for next week when the planets are more conducive for clearing the air. Meanwhile, create a healthy distraction by doing something unexpected and extraordinary."
cancer,2015-07-24,"You're ready for fun and games even before the weekend begins and you can't help but let the whole world know it. Although you might not have any plans set in stone yet, you can imagine almost anything is possible while dreamy Neptune trines the passionate Scorpio Moon in your 5th House of Play. In fact, your fantasies are so vivid today that you might even start to believe they're true. The first thing you should do is talk over your expectations with someone you trust. Initiating a reality check now can save you from an awkward moment later on."
leo,2015-07-24,"Emotional interactions on the home front could lead to a messy conflict that hijacks your weekend. Luckily, your current annoyance won't necessarily trigger a major confrontation if you're willing to utilize flexibility in your interactions with a close friend or relative. Reduce the pressure now by dragging the feelings that lurk beneath the surface out into the light. Even if a heart-to-heart conversation feels uncomfortable at first, being honest resolves the tension before things get out of hand. If you toss water on the embers today, you won't have any fires to put out tomorrow."
virgo,2015-07-24,"Interpersonal communication might feel strained now, but maintaining a healthy perspective is necessary instead of obsessing over an issue that ultimately doesn't matter. Your biggest concern isn't what to say; it's whether or not to say anything at all so as not to disturb the peace. However, denying the problem isn't a satisfying solution, so sit down for a heartfelt discussion today before it is too late. You might just be pleasantly surprised when others enthusiastically meet you on common ground."
libra,2015-07-24,"You may be able to sail through the day, but you're still afraid of hitting rocks you can't see from your vantage point. It's difficult to tell if you are drifting deeper into the choppy waters today or if you are returning to the shallow waters of the shore. Either way, you must get to the bottom of a relationship dilemma in order to reestablish your equilibrium. Once you acknowledge your core values, your vessel will regain its proper course. Maintaining balance is easy to do when you have your priorities straight."
scorpio,2015-07-24,"You normally undertake an emotional journey into your private world of unexpressed feelings when the moody Moon makes her monthly visit to your sign. However, the dynamics are more complicated now because someone might be withholding important information from you. Thankfully, there's no need to kick and scream for answers yet; it may just be your insecurities interfering with reality. Simply observe what's happening around you with a healthy dose of detachment; everything will make more sense in the days ahead."
sagittarius,2015-07-24,"You're not in the mood for company now but retreat isn't an option when there are so many demands being made on your time. You need to be at the top of your game mentally, not just for your benefit but also for everyone who depends on you. Keep your eyes and ears wide open. Staying in the communication loop today will pay off over the weekend when social activities bring you the satisfaction you seek. Sacrifice your solitude if you want to maintain your credibility amongst your peers."
capricorn,2015-07-24,"You may be totally exasperated today because you know that fulfilling your current responsibilities might not serve your long-term interests. You clearly have ambitious goals, but must set them aside now to cater to the needs of the group. The more you can focus on the immediate tasks at hand, the faster you will finish. However, people seem to be distracting you as if it is some sort of parlor game to see who can keep you from your job the longest. Play along for the sake of the team, but remember to return to the work waiting for you as soon as possible."
aquarius,2015-07-24,"You're not afraid of complicated logistics; in fact, you thrive on difficult mental puzzles and complex mechanical concepts. However, you don't enjoy being enmeshed in the tangled web of a sticky emotional conundrum now. Unfortunately, there may be a weird power struggle brewing that you can't understand. Don't push for resolution yet unless you want to stir up a hornet's nest. Be patient; settling the score next week without conflict is likely if you can let it go today."
pisces,2015-07-24,"You're under the impression you can sense every single wave in the universal sea of consciousness today. Nevertheless, it's an impossible task to process all your perceptions when you are receiving so many signals. The emotional intensity may be so great now that you feel like shutting off your radar and going undercover. However, the current trick is to focus on the small things and do them well. Leave the big picture for another day when life isn't so noisy and complicated."
aries,2015-07-25,"Your outrageous actions might be shocking today as revolutionary Uranus electrifies your key planet Mars. But you could lose your credibility if you rattle the cage at home just to generate a reaction. Your creative energy is irrepressible and you're willing to push the envelope, but something or someone may be blocking your inner artist from running free. If change needs to occur now, then your radical behavior is worth the ensuing drama it provokes. But if you're just looking for an adrenaline rush, hold onto your horses because the risk won't be worth the reward."
taurus,2015-07-25,"Someone's sudden emotional disclosure could rock your world today. The things you learn might be so unexpected that it's as if the ground is shaking beneath your feet. But you can't allow people to upset your center of gravity when you need to fine-tune your plans for the future. It's one thing to be a sounding board for a friend who is struggling to process their feelings; however, you need to figure out a way to help them without destabilizing your life at the same time. Drawing clear boundaries is the first step to success."
gemini,2015-07-25,"Expressing your feelings as they occur today is the simplest strategy to prevent your thoughts from driving you crazy. Although you may not be comfortable revealing your true emotions, it's a lot safer than bottling them up until the pressure becomes unbearable. Instead of waiting until you lose your temper at the most inopportune moment, gradually let off steam before it builds to a boiling point. You might misdirect your anger if you get swept up in the moment and say too much. Deliver you message in small doses and moderate your tone for the least disruptive outcome."
cancer,2015-07-25,"Your friends are aware that you're keeping secrets, but they don't want to pry because they know how much you value your privacy. You may be so immersed in an emotional experience now that you're uncertain how to express your energy. But rather than immediately diving into the deep end of the pool today, splash around in the shallow end until you are more accustomed to the temperature. Your shyness will pass if you can get past your initial awkwardness and share your feelings with those who love you the most."
leo,2015-07-25,"You could speak your truth so colorfully that others are taken back by your blunt delivery. But your dramatic flair is non-negotiable; you can't change your character just because your forthrightness makes someone uncomfortable. Unfortunately, your common sense is worn to threads today and you might not have the patience to temper your actions. Although you may get a kick out of shocking people now, don't act unconsciously and hurt those you love with your antics; practicing compassion enables you to keep your priorities in place."
virgo,2015-07-25,"There's a fine line between acting on your impulses and just doing something plain foolish. Unfortunately, your fear of being negatively judged might motivate you to overcompensate today, thinking it best to bury your feelings and move on without a word. However, suppressing your desires just drives them deeper and strengthens your subconscious resolve to do something drastic. You need an inventive outlet for your restless energy now; exercising a little healthy rebellion is fine as long as there are no casualties in the process."
libra,2015-07-25,"You want recognition from your peers today, but you still value your dignity more than you're craving public admiration. Nevertheless, placing yourself directly in the limelight may not be as rewarding as you currently imagine. If you want to maintain your stellar reputation within the group, be on your best behavior now and don't try to steal the show. A successful ensemble production is the most rewarding experience for everyone in the end."
scorpio,2015-07-25,"You're poised to strike back if your friends criticize your recent efforts today. Ultimately, you want to be acknowledged for your contributions and appreciated for your talents just like everyone else. Instead of retaliating with a clever zinger or giving others the cold shoulder, take a more productive path and repurpose your frustration into an impassioned drive to accomplish your goals. Be proud of your work; your satisfaction at the end of the day makes it all worthwhile."
sagittarius,2015-07-25,"You may rush in and try to save the day, but you could end up causing more harm than good if you don't pay attention to the clues of the cosmos. A hint of chaos is in the air today and things feel a little too wild and wacky even for you anything-goes Centaurs. The solution is simple: don't try to fix what you don't understand. No one expects you to play superhero 24/7, so give others the chance to shine while you cheer them on from the sidelines instead."
capricorn,2015-07-25,"The stranger things are in your environment now, the stronger your motivation to hold your ground. However, the safety zone you might like to run to only exists in your imagination. Ironically, you realize that a strategy based on fear won't work, which encourages you to take a sudden risk today. However, an extreme response isn't the appropriate antidote to the current instability, either. Taking several baby steps is more sensible than making one single giant leap before you're ready. You're not operating in a vacuum; what you do affects others more than you know."
aquarius,2015-07-25,"You might be obsessed with increasing your personal freedom while independent Uranus is prominently in the picture today. However, your spirits may be dampened now with the brooding Moon-Mars trine occurring in water signs. Staying in touch with your feelings is a challenge while you are traveling through such unfamiliar territory. Keep checking in with your heart so you know which path to follow. Thankfully, finding humor in the most unlikely places is your saving grace."
pisces,2015-07-25,"Relationship dynamics are changing so fast now that you can barely keep up. The romantic energy is suddenly shifting, and your new outlook is quite different from your previous perspective. For example, wooing each other into the wee hours of the morning often turns into diaper changes in the middle of the night as love evolves. Although you might want to make a radical move today, let your feelings develop at their own pace along with the rhythm of life. As Einstein reminds us, ""The only reason for time is so that everything doesn't happen at once."""
aries,2015-07-26,"No matter how serious your intentions are today, it's too soon to say whether or not you'll be successful at getting much accomplished. You can be quite the convincing salesperson now, but you may be as good at fooling yourself as you are at misleading others. If someone accepts your over-the-top expectations as the truth, you might have to face the music when the facts are discovered. A wiser approach is to be completely realistic now so you don't have to backtrack and revise your story later. Full disclosure is the best policy."
taurus,2015-07-26,"A little voice in the back of your mind is warning you to tread carefully in your relationships today. Meanwhile, your closest friends may be cheering you on, encouraging you to make your move. Nevertheless, there's no reason to justify your caution to anyone if you aren't ready. However, you're more inclined to take a chance and start a discussion on a sensitive topic as the day wears on. Just proceed at your own pace; you already know from prior experience that you achieve better results when you follow your own heart."
gemini,2015-07-26,"You're inspired to share a spiritual experience, weave your words into a poetic phrase and put a positive spin on nearly everything you say today. Happily, your current idealism motivates you to reestablish a solid connection with a loved one now. However, underlying tension won't likely disappear overnight. Do whatever you can to  alleviate the stress, but remember that repairing a relationship is an ongoing work in progress. Open your heart and love will find a way."
cancer,2015-07-26,"You often choose to keep your feelings under wraps because you're afraid of being judged or criticized. Nevertheless, today's effusive Sagittarius Moon urges you to blurt out whatever is on your mind before considering the consequences. Pushing through your natural resistance allows you to follow the current advice of the cosmos. Just remember that you're the only one who can decide how far you want to venture out of your cozy shell. Find a friendly audience before revealing the whims of your heart."
leo,2015-07-26,"You want to be as positive as you can in everything you do now that the cheerful Sagittarius Moon harmonizes with the Sun and Mercury in demonstrative Leo. But it's tough to connect with others in a lighthearted manner if you're still holding on to stressful memories of the recent past. Luckily, you can still come through for those you love if you concentrate on being real, rather than on being liked. Believe it or not, authenticity wins out over popularity in the end."
virgo,2015-07-26,"You are dancing with such wild abandon today that you might forget to pay attention to little things like the music and the steps. Thankfully, you still have your common sense intact because graceful Venus blesses you with a cool, calm and collected perspective. Although you want to be open and honest, keeping some things secret may be appropriate now. Just don't let your caution morph into apathy in the process. Find the sweet spot between disclosing everything and saying nothing at all."
libra,2015-07-26,"Surprisingly, you could be the most practical one in the group today because the recent Venus-Saturn square is rattled by the reflective Moon in your 3rd House of Communication. You can easily discern what is real and what is an illusion. Although your friendly demeanor disarms others, your inner perfectionist and logical thinking are running the show now. If you visualize what you want in clear detail and hold steadfast to your dream, you can manifest miracles in your life."
scorpio,2015-07-26,"You might achieve more than you expect today once you get into your groove. Tying up loose ends actually feels satisfying and your self-confidence grows with each task you complete now. Remember, nothing will hold you back for long, except your own self-imposed limitations. Stick to your agenda and continue building momentum throughout the day. You can move mountains with a little perseverance and a lot of sweat equity."
sagittarius,2015-07-26,"People can't help but experience your inspirational side now that the evocative Moon is back in your fiery sign. Your passionate appeal could motivate others to subscribe to your ideas today whether your perspective is accurate or not. Naturally, you wouldn't mislead anyone intentionally, but the pictures you now paint with your words can be so pretty that everyone wants to participate in your story. Though telling a tall tale might be fun for a while, adhering to the facts will keep you out of trouble."
capricorn,2015-07-26,"You're uncharacteristically inclined to dramatize everything you say today, making it tough to maintain your credibility. However, you can utilize the expansive nature of the fearless Sagittarius Moon to defend others who may not be as eloquent as you. There's no reason to rush the process now; your words carry more weight when you give them plenty of time to fully sink in. Fortunately, your passionate determination empowers you to accomplish extraordinary feats and perform random acts of kindness at the same time."
aquarius,2015-07-26,"Your friends come knocking at your door for advice today while the Moon's presence in your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes creates utopian visions of the future. Your strategy is to focus on the potential prosperity now rather than the fear of scarcity. Fortunately, you can have a positive impact on others if you maintain an optimistic outlook. No one will accuse you of wearing rose-colored glasses if you remember to present both sides of an issue in a fair light."
pisces,2015-07-26,"You want your friends and relatives to acknowledge your competence at work while the Moon is highlighting your 10th House of Public Status. Nevertheless, you must balance your desire for efficiency with your need to have fun. Prioritize the tasks in front of you; if you finish the most important ones now, you'll earn the right to kick back later. Don't squander your reputation when there's so much at stake."
aries,2015-07-27,"You're on a roll, talking up a storm with everyone you meet. Your enthusiasm is stimulated by your lofty visions of the future as the fiery Sagittarius Moon inspires you to aim for the stars. Unfortunately, you could easily overextend your reach, lose your balance and fall off your unicorn. It's not easy to gain mastery of your own energy when you're so passionate about life, but it's certainly worth the effort. It's amazing what magic you can create with a little fairy dust and the right attitude."
taurus,2015-07-27,"Your future seems too uncertain for your liking, and you're willing to take drastic measures to put your life back on stable ground. You may attempt to plan your day in great detail because you prefer to know exactly where you are going. Unfortunately, the lines on the map keep shifting today, making it impossible to determine a reliable route. Thankfully, the current ambiguity won't last long; explore all the alternatives you can imagine while you have the chance."
gemini,2015-07-27,"Someone's larger-than-life drama could give you a colossal headache now. Normally it's you that's bouncing off walls, but today the restlessness of others keeps pulling you off center. You really don't want to be a buzzkill and spoil everyone's fun, but you might try to rein it in so you can redefine your limits. Don't worry if you have to play the role of a parental figure for a while. Once you have re-established your routine, you'll quickly return to your old ways and be the life of the party once again."
cancer,2015-07-27,"A total stranger may enter your life with a get-rich-quick scheme or a magic love potion, but if it sounds too good to be true, it most likely is. Whatever you do now, don't fall for blind optimism or naive idealism when it comes to money or love. Ironically, big ideas might inspire others, but you're more successful if you handle your life in bite-sized increments today. Paint a detailed picture of your future in your mind's eye. Take small steps and walk before you run."
leo,2015-07-27,"Your optimism is a wonderful asset as long as you know when to stop believing your own hype. Unfortunately, you might be so dazzled by your own brilliance today that you lose your ability to make sound decisions. However, taking yourself out of the center of every plot widens your perspective and reveals a whole new spectrum of possibilities. There are many different kinds of success beyond those involving material wealth. Your life improves in surprising ways when you realize you don't have to turn everything you touch into gold."
virgo,2015-07-27,"You might see the advantages to being left to your own devices today, but you also desire close companionship. Naturally, you can't choose to wear your invisibility cloak if you also want to be noticed on the social scene. But others can be so wrapped up in their personal dramas that you get dragged along for the ride. If you make your intentions known right from the start, you won't get washed away by someone else's emotional tide. Remember, you can help out those you love, but the only one you can truly save is yourself."
libra,2015-07-27,"You may be talking a good game now, but doubt and confusion could be lurking behind your show of bravado. Even if you're passionate about a specific goal, you might not be able to turn your ideas into something practical. Making a concrete plan work should be simple business but it's not today because as soon as you get close to your objective, it loses its sparkle. Although some people believe all roads lead to Rome, the journey is still more important than your final destination."
scorpio,2015-07-27,"You're setting an admirable example at work these days, but following through with your inspiration may be trickier than motivating others to join your cause. You might be tempted to start a project but your thinking is a bit warped now, especially with respect to your long-term goals. Ultimately, it's easier to encourage someone else today than it is to manifest your own visions. Nevertheless, don't give up; be ready to start plowing in the fields of dreams again at a moment's notice."
sagittarius,2015-07-27,"People just don't seem to understand your motives today. You have an abundance of great ideas and plenty of energy while the reflective Moon is camping out in your inspirational sign. In fact, you may be climbing so high in the atmosphere now that you must fly solo because no one can keep up with you. Stop trying to include others on your adventure; you'll soar to greater altitudes than ever before when you accept that you're on your own. The sky is the limit if you are brave enough to go it alone."
capricorn,2015-07-27,"You might not put a lot of faith into your intuition as a general rule; you prefer making decisions based on the hard cold facts. However, your psychic radar is picking up on all kinds of warning signals today and it's advantageous to listen. Obviously, you can choose to shut down your imagination, ignore your hunches and pay the price later. Or you can take a risk and remain open to the information you're receiving now from beyond your five senses. Sometimes, the unconventional approach is actually the most sensible one."
aquarius,2015-07-27,"Normally your associates lean on you because even if you are an out-of-the-box thinker, your conclusions are usually quite rational. However, you might waffle on an investment today because you're not thinking clearly, especially when it comes to your finances. Don't allow your mind to wander too far, but keep your thoughts to yourself if you do drift off track. Illusory Neptune's presence in your 2nd House of Personal Resources clouds your logic so save the fiscal planning for another day. Remember your priorities; don't let money come between you and your friends."
pisces,2015-07-27,"Utilizing your creativity in the workplace may be necessary for your personal fulfillment today. You have the good fortune to be able to daydream in vivid colors and wrap-around sound. But your penchant for fantasy only gets in the way of success now unless you can turn your liability into a valuable asset by transforming your regular routine into an exciting game. If you love your job, you'll never work a day in your life."
aries,2015-07-28,"You may be so jazzed about a new project that you're off and running today, even if you don't have a plan in place yet. However, your exhilaration won't last long unless you develop a sensible strategy. A reassessment of your resources is the first step to getting your dreams off the ground. Luckily, you can remain idealistic now without losing your footing. However, balancing your optimism with realism is not enough; once you have your angle figured out, you must also initiate action and be willing to follow through on whatever you start."
taurus,2015-07-28,"It might sound too good to be true, but chasing your creative whims today leads to sweet rewards. Releasing your inner child is just what the doctor ordered. What did you love when you were a kid? What's missing from your life now? If necessary, delve into your memories to recover a missing piece from the past. As master storyteller Tom Robbins wrote, ""It's never too late to have a happy childhood."""
gemini,2015-07-28,"Sinking into your emotions can seem scary at first, but once you get the hang of opening up to others, you might recognize the benefits. In fact, you may even wonder what took you so long to see the light. However, don't be misled into thinking everything will be wonderful forever just because some warm and fuzzy feelings are surfacing now. Nevertheless, taking the good, the bad and the ugly without reservation can be empowering for everyone involved."
cancer,2015-07-28,"Sharing your feelings with a close friend or partner grows more comfortable as the day wears on. At first, you might be overwhelmed as if there aren't enough hours in the day to finish your work. You surely don't have time to indulge in personal conversations. But then you suddenly realize time is just an illusion and you can have your cake and eat it too. You have the power to consciously bend reality in your favor now if you harness the cosmic energy to work on your behalf."
leo,2015-07-28,"Your mind may be on your money today, but there's an intrinsic link between your attitude at work and your current fiscal condition. Although you might try to deny this connection at first, when your productivity is flowing, the income will follow. Nevertheless, don't waste too much time trying to micromanage your budget now; Of course, it's necessary to watch the bottom line, but a lasting solution to your current problem won't come from saving pennies. Increasing your net worth starts with improving your self-esteem."
virgo,2015-07-28,Everyone can see the twinkle in your eyes and the bounce in your step as you exhibit your playful side today. Just because you have a no-nonsense reputation doesn't stop you from flirting when you're in the mood. There's no better time to ask for what you want than when captivating Venus harmonizes with the Moon in your 5th House of Romance. Don't wait for a more opportune moment to shine your love light; grab the cosmic opportunity  and reveal your heart's true colors.
libra,2015-07-28,"You may be keeping your feelings under wraps today. Subtlety is more your style while your key planet Venus is on a spiritual retreat in your 12th House of Mystery. It might seem as if everything is moving in slow motion when it comes to interactions with others, especially since you're operating in a dream state now. Nevertheless, your desire to establish meaningful connections inspires you to push through the fog. Ultimately, determination is your ally as you seek ways to deepen your relationships."
scorpio,2015-07-28,"Connecting with others seems effortless today as you reach out to include them in your plans. It's as if your regular air of mystery magically morphs into an easily accessible charm. Even if your natural tendency is to hang back and keep your guard up, you're feeling friendlier now, making this a great time to mix and mingle. Break your old patterns -- and everyone else's expectations -- to get the most pleasure out of the social opportunities the cosmos is offering you. Open up your heart and watch what happens."
sagittarius,2015-07-28,"You might let out an audible sigh of relief as the external noise finally quietens down now. Normally, you enjoy the Moon's monthly return to your sign, but this time around the energy could have been just too much - - even if there was plenty to celebrate. The Moon's shift out of your sign today is a welcome change of pace. You don't want to wreck your infamous reputation as a free spirit, but secretly you're eager to demonstrate your more ambitious side and get back to work."
capricorn,2015-07-28,"Relationships are top priority today as your long-term goals align with your personal desires. The Moon's return to your sign often isn't a comfortable fit because it emphasizes your lack of control with respect to your emotions. However, an affectionate Moon-Venus trine encourages your heart to take over and run the show now. Seize the moment and tell someone special what you really want. The universe might just have a surprise in store for you if you come from a place of love."
aquarius,2015-07-28,"You can't avoid interpersonal attachments now, even if your feelings complicate the day. Unfortunately, denying your changing moods only makes them stronger. Thankfully, your current practicality rides to the rescue. Although you might not be able to make your emotions disappear entirely, you can downplay them enough to choose the most sensible route. Sharing your concerns reduces the stress while also giving you the chance to receive some really good advice. Find a trustworthy ally and start talking."
pisces,2015-07-28,"You're willing to negotiate with a friend or partner today because the longevity of a relationship is ultimately more important than the details of the current arrangement. You have a chance to restructure the rules of the road and your newfound objectivity bodes well for a beneficial outcome. Reassessing the deeper issues rather than just focusing on the surface noise is the best use of your current pragmatism. This can be your next step in your personal growth, so set the stage now to make room for your long-term goals to evolve."
aries,2015-07-29,"There is so much emotional noise today, it's nearly impossible to process all that's going on. You might not be very receptive to conflicting messages because you are afraid of being sidetracked by someone else's agenda. Meanwhile, you're defending your right to maintain your individuality because you're on your own mission. Nevertheless, there isn't as much at stake as you think, so pick your battles carefully before you find yourself in the middle of an unnecessary argument. Take the high road and strike out on your own."
taurus,2015-07-29,"You might find yourself in the middle of someone else's power struggle today but you're not willing to be distracted by disagreement that's not yours. You may attempt to sidestep the entire conversation, but you come to realize you can have a major positive impact on the situation. Thankfully, you don't have to produce a solution out of thin air; all you must do is listen to both sides of the debate. Sufficiently airing an issue could be enough to dissolve the tension for now. Playing the role of the reluctant hero saves the day."
gemini,2015-07-29,"Sharing your feelings with a trusted friend seems like a good idea, but a relatively harmless disclosure could elicit an unexpected reaction. You understand the necessity of self-restraint now because you can sense the rather delicate balance of power. Nevertheless, you aren't eager to change your mind today, and your current lack of flexibility might make a tense situation even worse. On the other hand, meeting another person halfway manifests mutual benefits. Finding common ground gives everyone a chance to be a winner."
cancer,2015-07-29,"Someone's attempts to control your feelings could bring an upwelling of anger to the surface today, but it seems more intense than the situation actually warrants. Although you feel the need to vent your frustration, you don't want to deal with the emotional fallout. Play it cool and circumnavigate the current conflict. Or, if you must engage, ride your passion and speak your truth, no matter what. There's no right or wrong answer when it comes to your heart."
leo,2015-07-29,"You might bury your feelings today to avoid a potential meltdown as your emotions draw you into the shadows. You're accustomed to the light, but may be resistant to exploring the dark. Don't be distracted by trying to follow your previous agenda. It's more crucial to concentrate on your reactions and process them in real time than wasting energy explaining your motives to others. Just open your heart and show up as you are."
virgo,2015-07-29,"You're unhappy about the public role you must play now and you're not sure how to get out of it. Unfortunately, there are no quick and easy fixes to your problem, even if you are in touch with the complex dynamics at work. You may be tempted to internalize someone else's struggle and treat it as if it were your own. However, steering clear of any melodrama that isn't yours is mandatory. Don't worry about disappointing others if you choose to back away. You have bigger fish to fry and little time to do it."
libra,2015-07-29,"Everyone knows you excel in delicate negotiations, so it's only reasonable that they would call on you for assistance now. Although you might want to help, you have your own decisions to make today. Fortunately, there's still time to practice a bit of subtle diplomacy, shuffling back and forth between the disagreeing parties. Your success depends on remaining neutral at all costs. A fair and balanced approach benefits all parties involved."
scorpio,2015-07-29,"You have been in the middle of an intense tug-of-war for weeks now, unable to fully express your anger. Unfortunately, you can't just walk away from a conflict that pits your need for long-term emotional security against your desire to tell the truth. But the situation is more complex if you're uncertain about what you're willing to negotiate. In the end, practicing the art of compromise helps you navigate these tumultuous waters. Flexibility is your friend."
sagittarius,2015-07-29,"You would do anything to avoid being dragged into an emotional squabble today yet it becomes more difficult to stay on the sidelines as time goes on. You're not interested in choosing sides because you don't want to fuel unnecessary conflicts. Nevertheless, you can still be an outspoken community member who warns about the pitfalls of spreading fearful negativity. Follow your own spiritual path and let your love light shine as a beacon for the rest of the world to follow."
capricorn,2015-07-29,"A relationship may be a significant source of tension now as battle lines are drawn and remaining civil grows more urgent moment by moment. You might begin sorting out your differences through cool and calm communication. Nevertheless, you can easily slip back into emotionally engaging in the ensuing drama. Instead of behaving self-righteously and pushing someone's buttons, act with restraint. A small dose of discretion goes a long way to settle everyone's frazzled nerves. Be kind; think more and speak less."
aquarius,2015-07-29,"Maintaining objectivity is unlikely today, even as you try to see the pros and cons of a coworker's plan. Unfortunately, you believe you know what's best for everyone and are quick to share your opinion with anyone who asks. But instead of judging others, clean up your own act first. Making small improvements at work throughout the next week is more constructive than wasting time blaming another person for your dilemma. The biggest changes start with you."
pisces,2015-07-29,"Your friends might believe they have your best interests at heart, but their behavior is too controlling for your taste today. Nevertheless, it can be awkward to come right out and tell them to back off because your abrupt message could alienate your most supportive allies. Dig in your heels and set clear personal boundaries that empower you to feel truly independent. Just make sure you listen to the advice you receive before going off on your own."
aries,2015-07-30,"You can push boundaries without even realizing it when you are keyed up about something new. However, today's enthusiasm might be a bit misdirected as assertive Mars is misaligned with delusional Neptune. The problem is your favorite idea may not be as brilliant as you think. Don't be so cocky that you stubbornly try to defend an incorrect assumption or an unrealistic goal. Be patient and review your plans one more time; haste makes waste."
taurus,2015-07-30,"Your professional goals may seem more tangible with your dreams right at the tips of your outstretched fingers. On the positive side, you can believe a fantasy is so real that your legendary determination makes it so. However, you may be overconfident, convincing yourself that you're very close to reaching your destination even if you're not. Use your common sense before wasting more energy pursuing something that can't happen. Focus on the possibilities in the present moment instead."
gemini,2015-07-30,"Jumping to conclusions can land you in a heap of trouble today as you revive an old dream of becoming a student for the sole purpose of learning. Exploring educational options is admirable as long as your primary goal is to expand your mind. Unfortunately, the Moon's visit to your 9th House of Higher Truth doesn't always prompt the most practical thinking. Widening your perspective is a healthy process as long as you don't rush to make a decision. Avoid participating in a comedy of errors today by giving your ideas enough time to develop before doing anything rash."
cancer,2015-07-30,"It's safer to keep your unexpressed emotional desires to yourself today, for your intensity could be unsettling to someone else. However, you still must be willing to gamble on the unknown if you want to experience new levels of intimacy with someone that you admire. Revealing your feelings creates a vulnerability that could pull you into a danger zone; thankfully, the benefits outweigh the risks if you're sincere in affection."
leo,2015-07-30,"You might be concerned that a magical moment could slip through your fingers today, but no amount of logic can help you figure out an effective strategy to stabilize your position. Attempting to rationally understand a relationship that eludes comprehension is an exercise in futility. An approach based upon intellectual analysis only brings you back around to the same dissatisfaction you're trying to escape. It's time to release your need to discover truths other than what is already in your heart."
virgo,2015-07-30,"You have a perfect opportunity to influence your physical well-being today by simply changing your mind. The Moon's shift into innovative Aquarius and your 6th House of Daily Routine helps you focus your energy on self-improvement. The powerful impact that positive thinking has on your life should not be underestimated. Obviously, taking decisive action is part of the program, but for now your attitude is the key to a happier and healthier you."
libra,2015-07-30,"You could easily rekindle an old flame today; however, your feelings may be more dependent on your illusions than reality. You're more open to the possibility of playful romance, whether or not you're willing to express your emotions. Since a current infatuation might be the result of idle daydreaming, you really don't require anyone to act out your fantasy. Go ahead and enjoy the fruits of your imagination without trying to reach satisfaction in the real world."
scorpio,2015-07-30,"You believe you understand how a domestic situation is going to play out, especially if you are in the process of reevaluating your long-term goals. However, it's nearly impossible to know to make a decision now because your future still seems like a fantasy. There's little you can do to fill in the elusive details of your upcoming adventures. Instead of taking concrete action, give yourself permission to dream without attempting to make anything real yet."
sagittarius,2015-07-30,"Communicating your ideas can be exasperating today, especially if you want others to play on your team. The good news is you have many options available, but your current plans probably lack substance. Normally, you're quite happy to float in the realm of abstractions. However, your immediate need to create realistic goals now is in direct conflict with your dreamier thoughts. Nevertheless, making a commitment to anything is better than drifting along without direction. Saying yes requires you to take a risk, but putting all your eggs in one basket is safer than you think."
capricorn,2015-07-30,"Your ego may lose its sense of proportion now as others encourage you to reach for your dreams. Obviously, self-confidence is a useful asset, but your outrageous ideas can annoy those who might otherwise be your most supportive allies. Moderating your ambitions with a little modesty is a wise strategy today. A healthy perspective on life makes all the difference between your success and failure. A touch of humility can save the day."
aquarius,2015-07-30,"People might think you're being particularly weird today, but it's just business as usual for you. In fact, you might have a few tricks up your sleeve to make you to seem less grounded than you actually are. You can cleverly avoid a skirmish over who is in charge if others are less threatened by you. However, you're still a formidable opponent behind your eccentric veneer. Don't waste too much energy with a strategy based on misdirection; honest communication from the start is a much better way to build trust and get things done."
pisces,2015-07-30,"You may be engaged in an uphill battle to keep your dreams under control today because they are overflowing right into your waking life. Obviously, rationalizing your feelings when your emotions are strongly influenced by unconscious urges is a tough task. If you can't map out a sensible course of action, step back until the path becomes clear. A temporary retreat isn't a sign of defeat when you're using your time constructively to get your bearings."
aries,2015-07-31,"You want to shout your opinions from the rooftop today as the Aquarius Full Moon lights up your 11th House of Networking. But you're not too concerned about what anyone else thinks now because you're sure that your perspective is the right one. Although your plan might work out just fine, your words still could sound more aggressive than you actually feel. Garner support by toning down your message and acknowledging the validity of alternate approaches. Create an environment where everyone can be a winner, not just you."
taurus,2015-07-31,"Your unwavering commitment to accomplish your work prompts you to do things your own unique way. The Aquarius Full Moon wires your 10th House of Career, driving you to succeed at any cost. Your ambition is admirable, but you can be so resistant to change that your closest friends wonder why you are sabotaging your own possible success. Unfortunately, your plans may be jeopardized without the cooperation of your allies. Blind optimism could prevent you from seeing things objectively, so be open to the advice others have to offer."
gemini,2015-07-31,"Your original approach to your job demonstrates your cleverness, but it might also end up making more work. Today's Aquarius Full Moon emphasizes your 9th House of Big Ideas, inspiring you to dream about all the amazing possibilities ahead, rather than concentrating on the present moment. Thankfully, your goals are attainable if you proceed with caution and stick to the basics. Keep things simple and don't look back."
cancer,2015-07-31,"Negotiations can be tricky business today, especially if you're worried about getting your fair share of the pie. The Aquarius Full Moon overwhelms your 8th House of Shared Resources with brilliant ideas, triggering issues around jointly held possessions or investments. People may appeal to your egalitarian values, urging you to lessen your demands. But you want to be an equal partner now, instead of playing a subservient role. Don't just say yes to make someone else feel better while your self-esteem suffers unnecessarily. Standing up for your rights earns you the respect you deserve."
leo,2015-07-31,"A powerful opportunity to heal your heart can be a gift from the cosmos today if you're experiencing difficulties in the love department. The Aquarius Full Moon illuminates your 7th House of Others, possibly reactivating an unresolved relationship issue. Meanwhile, romantic Venus returns to linger in your sign for the next two months, stirring up feelings for an old friend or lover. Fortunately, re-framing a past relationship in a new light alters your perspective and frees you to be more fully alive in every moment."
virgo,2015-07-31,"You may be so preoccupied with your thoughts that you don't recognize the emotional warmth waiting to embrace you with open arms. The conceptual Aquarius Full Moon falls in your 6th House of Details, encouraging you to lean on your analytical skills to solve a current problem. Although you might believe you're listening carefully, you won't pick up other people's messages unless they arrive on your exact frequency. Opening your mind to new channels of communication today can teach you a very valuable lesson about connecting with your heart."
libra,2015-07-31,"Your creativity shines while the Aquarius Full Moon sparkles in your 5th House of Self-Expression. You could put on a brilliant performance if you don't try to control every part of the process. A smart strategy is to have a variety of projects to keep you busy while you're hoping for inspiration to strike. Be ready to ride a creative wave if it comes along, but don't be disappointed if nothing extraordinary happens today. As Tom Petty sings, ""The waiting is the hardest part."""
scorpio,2015-07-31,"Something could suddenly snap today as the Aquarius Full Moon activates your 4th House of Domestic Conditions while opposing the showy Leo Sun in your 10th House of Public Status. Your resolve to restore balance to your life should alleviate any emotional upset but downplaying your feelings isn't the answer. Instead of pitting your personal responsibilities against your professional commitments, find ways to support one with the other. Ultimately, creating stability on the home front gives you a firm foundation on which to build your success."
sagittarius,2015-07-31,"You are aware that your wanderlust makes it difficult to follow through on existing commitments these days. The free-thinking Aquarius Full Moon excites your 3rd House of Distractions, reactivating a familiar theme of intellectual restlessness. Although you might be frustrated by current circumstantial limitations, you can still improve your situation by acknowledging your adventurous desires while simultaneously juggling your copious responsibilities. Managing your time creatively is the key to your success."
capricorn,2015-07-31,"Your current financial condition may seem rather unstable today while the erratic Aquarius Full Moon stresses your 2nd House of Money. Maybe you discover your cash on hand is less than anticipated or, perhaps, your bills are greater than previously calculated. Either way, don't avoid a fiscal issue that pops up now, because addressing it rationally is much wiser than putting it off -- even if you don't have a complete solution yet. Taking a small step in the right direction may be enough to set you on a path that eventually leads to a final answer."
aquarius,2015-07-31,"Sweeping changes are necessary to get your life back on track now. However, the Full Moon's presence in your sign brings unexpected events that require you to adapt to other people's schedules, anyway. It takes courage to be flexible now instead of rigidly sticking to an old agenda that no longer works. Although this might be an exercise in cooperation, don't lose yourself in the process. It may seem as if others are getting the better end of the deal, but in reality you're the one who stands to gain the most by opening your heart."
pisces,2015-07-31,You would rather pursue a more meaningful path in life but dramatic events at work demand an increasing amount of your undivided attention. Your friends and colleagues might not even notice that you're struggling now that the Aquarius Full Moon shines in your 12th House of Invisibility. But there's no escape from your routine or your responsibilities. The answer is to integrate a more spiritual approach into everything you do.
aries,2015-08-01,"By all appearances this is a day made in heaven to play, party and perform. Normally, you're not the shy one and would be the first to jump on stage and entertain the crowd. However, you may be in a more serious mood now and can't seem to snap out of it. Stop worrying about what might go wrong. If you continue to focus on the negative, you'll inadvertently bring it about. Instead of fretting that you may squander this opportunity for fun, just accept the cosmic energy as it is. You can't help but do what's right for you if you go with the flow."
taurus,2015-08-01,"You're happiest in the comfort of your own pasture, but even you easygoing Bulls can benefit from exploring the greener grass on the other side of the hill. You might try to justify your desire to stay at home and let the day pass you by without much action on your part. However, it's prudent to recognize your sense of balance is off kilter today. Free your mind and widen your horizons. The potential for pleasure is much greater now than you can imagine."
gemini,2015-08-01,"Your larger-than-life perceptions may lead you astray today, so don't rush to judgment before you have all the facts in place. Although your future is bright, not everything is as rosy as you currently think. You might draw the wrong conclusions now, even if you have plenty of good information at your disposal. Unfortunately, you could easily mix up reality with your illusions that are influenced by your desires. Positive change is in the air if you let go of your expectations and get out of your own way."
cancer,2015-08-01,"A clash over personal values with someone you love is unsettling to say the least. Although you're often the one to rein in your feelings if you fear rejection, it might be time to take a leap of faith and express what's in your heart. However, there's no reason to overreact and threaten the security of a meaningful relationship. This isn't a tug of war that requires someone to win and someone to lose; it's about being honest and accepting that intelligent people can possess differing viewpoints while still respecting and cherishing each other."
leo,2015-08-01,"You may be suffering from an emotional hangover as the bright light of yesterday's Full Moon begins to wane. Unfortunately, there's no rest for the weary when your name has top billing and you're expected to dazzle the crowd. Part of you loves the idea of an encore, but your inner voice is reminding you that you've had enough for now. You don't need the applause to know that you're adored. Let go of your leading role and see what it's like to work behind the scenes, instead."
virgo,2015-08-01,"A little peace and quiet may be yours for the asking today if you don't go looking for trouble. But cutting yourself off from your friends won't bring you the long-term emotional satisfaction you seek. Nevertheless, taking a break from your regular weekend activities could be enough to replenish your spirit. Being on your own for a while enables you to reengage socially later in the day with a fresh new attitude on life and love. A grateful heart is a powerful heart."
libra,2015-08-01,"It's nearly impossible to contain your joie de vivre these days. You might even consider running away with the circus while a pack of rowdy planets in your 11th House of Social Networking encourages you to connect with people who live life as an adventure. Although it's important to find like-minded souls who share your interests, don't give all your energy away to others today. There's magic inside you that needs to find a way out, so don't sacrifice your own creativity for the sake of the group."
scorpio,2015-08-01,"You thrive on demonstrating your competence today as the universe challenges you to achieve your goals. Luckily, you have already established a new direction in your life and are happily on your way to your destination. But although you're skipping down the yellow brick road, the closer you get to Oz the further away it appears. Don't trust your five senses now; your ability to make logical decisions may be impaired but your imagination can save the day. Follow your intuition wherever it leads."
sagittarius,2015-08-01,"You're so eager to rush off to the next amazing activity you can't even contain your excitement. Everything looks like it's coming up roses, but you are less in touch with reality the more extreme an imagined adventure seems. Scaling your expectations down to size is the first step to getting your life back on solid ground. Don't wait for the looming reality check to force you to do what you already know needs to be done. Your preemptive strike clears the air more efficiently than being struck by the lightning of karma."
capricorn,2015-08-01,"You might discover your resources are stretched further than you realized but you don't want others to know about your error in judgment. However, it's counterproductive to let your pride stand in the way when your closest friends are more than willing to help. Whether it's time, money or moral support you need, give someone a chance to be your personal hero for the day. Not only will you be able to accomplish your goals, you'll set the stage for a solid relationship built on real trust."
aquarius,2015-08-01,"People seem to think they know what's best for you today, but the truth is you're the captain of your own ship. Unfortunately, you might go overboard carrying your flag of independence too far. Others can play an important role by supporting your dreams if you let them. The trick is finding the sweet spot between cooperation and self-reliance. Collaborating is a positive experience if you don't lose your unique voice in the process."
pisces,2015-08-01,"There's too much drama going on today for your personal taste but it seems as if there isn't much you can do to avoid it. However, visualizing how you want things to play out just might have a subtle influence on the course of events. Use your imagination to paint a picture that's more in harmony with your preferences. Don't worry about the circumstances that are beyond your control; a minor adjustment to your behavior could alter your trajectory enough to change your destination."
aries,2015-08-02,"Let your freak flag fly and flirt like there's no tomorrow as mischievous Mercury trines uninhibited Uranus in your sign. Although social obligations and professional responsibilities continue to demand a significant portion of your attention, you have a sweet opportunity to reconnect with the innocence of romance today. A dream may be a wish your heart makes, but if you don't take a leap of faith and act on a fantasy, it won't stand a chance of coming true."
taurus,2015-08-02,"Dreams of the distant future pull you out of your comfortable past. As intrigued as you might be about all the possibilities that stretch out before you, it's less threatening to think about them than to take concrete action. It's as if you want to shine your light while remaining safely under the covers. Fortunately, you can count on your friends and family to listen to your hopes and concerns. Visit the outer limits in your imagination but remember that home is where your heart is."
gemini,2015-08-02,"You have a spiritual message to share with others today, but it may be challenging to find the right social context in which you can feel safe enough to let down your guard. There are plenty of thoughts running through your head now, including unorthodox political ideas and radical opinions about love. Hang out with a trusted friend who will walk on the wild side with you for a while. All topics are fair game; there's no need to withhold your personal expression as you explore new territory. Go forth and conquer."
cancer,2015-08-02,"You can't be faulted now for making a dramatic gesture that lets everyone know exactly where you stand on an important issue. Reality is giving you the green light to move forward and share things you may normally keep to yourself. As long as you're not trying to enlist anyone to join your cause, it's healthy to state your beliefs clearly, regardless of what others may think. Although your closest friends might not agree with everything you say, they will likely stand by your current decisions, nonetheless. Step out of the shadows and into the light of day."
leo,2015-08-02,"Although the universe is probably encouraging you nearly everywhere you look, too much of a good thing is not as wonderful as it sounds. If nothing else, at least examine your true motives if you're being generous to a fault when interacting with those you love. There's nothing wrong with telling a story so captivating that your audience is mesmerized, but you could take it too far. Less is more; exaggerating isn't necessary to get your message across. Stretching the envelope could seem like a brilliant idea in the moment, but you'll have a hard time finding your way back to the truth if you do."
virgo,2015-08-02,"You may be quite distracted by your vivid fantasies now even if they don't seamlessly fit into a conversation in your current social context. Although your imagination is working on overdrive today, you don't have to talk about your metaphysical beliefs to have a memorable experience. Thankfully, you can derive profound meaning from a spiritual awakening without anyone else knowing about it. Pursuing enlightenment is the natural thing to do while the magic follows you around wherever you go."
libra,2015-08-02,"You're striving for absolute transparency in communication today, but the truth is hard to find. You want to know exactly where your friends stand, yet the more you uncover, the less you know. It's even more confusing when the ones you love are sending so many mixed messages. You may eventually realize that everyone's conflicting advice is muddying the water, not clarifying it. You might have to withdraw from the group to reestablish your bearings. You can always ask questions again after you reevaluate your unrealistic expectations and whittle them down to size."
scorpio,2015-08-02,"You could surprise everyone today, even yourself, when you decide to buckle down and commit to a project. Although you are optimistic about your ambitious timetable, remember that Saturn the Tester is looming in the background now. No matter how much you plan, things could take longer than you think. Fortunately, your relentless nature works in your favor and will see you through to the other side. There's no reason to doubt your capabilities; just remain open to readjust your schedule as often as reality demands."
sagittarius,2015-08-02,"Although you Archers are the zodiac's champions of optimism, there are so many opportunities knocking at your door now that even you can't keep up with all of them. Adventures seem to be lurking around every corner; worlds are waiting to be explored beneath every rock. It's as if you're standing on top of a mountain and believe you can see forever and a day. Nevertheless, even the best of news comes with a price. If you lose all sense of boundaries, you could also lose your balance. However, maintaining a healthy and humble perspective enables you to go as far as you can imagine."
capricorn,2015-08-02,"You may be uncomfortable with someone's effusive display of unbridled joy today. It's not that you want to restrain anyone's natural expression, it's just that you're uneasy with such intense emotional displays. Nevertheless, you might be surprised by the lessons you learn from this opportunity. Take a page from their book and see what it feels like to relax the rules. Revealing your true colors now won't necessarily further your personal aspirations, but it certainly could bring a smile to your face that you will remember for a long time to come."
aquarius,2015-08-02,"You're more than willing to go along for the ride with an unconventional companion today. Ironically, you're eccentric in your own right, but may be suppressing your non-conformist tendencies because of current constraints. If others rattle your cage now, it awakens that part of your personality you have tried to bury for the sake of acceptance. Nevertheless, you're okay with your denial because it seems safer to express your weirdness through another person. Enjoy the unexpected buzz while it lasts, since responsibilities will demand your attention soon enough."
pisces,2015-08-02,"You could be lost in space today but you're able to camouflage your confusion by coming through with flying colors. Unfortunately, you can feel the pressure because others are expecting a lot from you. Luckily, your command performances may be so technically perfect that no one even has a clue that more is going on than meets their eyes. While they are mesmerized by the magic of the details of your actions, you're busy communing with nature, angels and aliens. Your clever trick of making everything seem normal gives you a wider latitude to explore all the other realms to your heart's delight."
aries,2015-08-03,"You wake up believing you can do anything today, but reality has a different tale to tell. Oddly enough, you won't likely be surprised if you run into an obstacle. It's as if your inner parent warned you to be more practical and you weren't willing to listen. Thankfully, it's not too late to change your ways. A more cautious approach to reaching your goals will take you further than running on enthusiasm. The trick to getting something accomplished now is honoring the opposite messages at play."
taurus,2015-08-03,"You might be tempted to take the day off today, but avoiding your responsibilities won't make them disappear. The fact of the matter is people are counting on you now and you don't want to let them down. Fortunately, your dependable nature motivates you to be there for those who need you the most. It turns out there's nothing more satisfying than being able to show up and save the day. Being a superhero is better than staying at home and missing all the action."
gemini,2015-08-03,"Beginning a project is one thing but finishing it is something entirely different today. You can talk a good game, but sooner or later others are going to expect you to put your words into action. But it's more complicated than it seems if you're not clear about your own objectives. Nevertheless, it may be wise to set your personal needs aside for a while and focus on the demands of work. The sooner you set a sustainable pace the more successful you will be by the end of the day. Start off small and build momentum as your confidence grows."
cancer,2015-08-03,"You have high hopes today, but you could easily underestimate the resources required to complete a job. You might begin by putting all your marbles on the table, but this unrestrained approach encourages you to blow through your time and money without much to show for your efforts. From a practical perspective, planning in advance makes a huge difference. A little self-discipline right from the start ensures you will have what you need down the road."
leo,2015-08-03,"You feel like you should be the star of the show, but could be dismayed to discover there's no audience. With so many planets in your demonstrative sign, you want it to be all about you today, but there are other factors to consider. Instead of rushing around to prove what you can do, spend your time creating a solid foundation for everyone else to build upon. You may not be admired in the way you prefer, but others will deeply appreciate your contributions in the long run."
virgo,2015-08-03,"It's nearly impossible to resolve the ongoing dissonance between your imagination and the current events in your life. Obviously, you know the difference between the subjective and objective realms, but you believe that your dreams could alter the outcome if your intentions are pure. To some extent this is true, but you still must start with the mundane now and work toward the spiritual, not the other way around. Maintaining a healthy flow between the inner and outer worlds is effective only when it's a two-way street."
libra,2015-08-03,"Seeking support and recognition from others is an exercise in futility today. No matter how much acknowledgment or love you receive, it may still feel like you're not getting what you deserve. Nevertheless, self-esteem begins with loving yourself; instead of looking everywhere on the outside for validation, focus on your strengths and not your weaknesses. When you perform at your highest potential without expecting anything in return, people will sit up and take notice."
scorpio,2015-08-03,"No matter how hard you work today, there's still more to do. However, you might be further along on your path than you realize. Sometimes, you can't see the results of your efforts right away, like when you're climbing a hill. Until you reach the summit, you don't have a wide enough perspective to see how far you've traveled. Continue on your present route without making any major changes until you gain the objectivity you need. Don't veer off track when you're so close to your destination."
sagittarius,2015-08-03,"All the promises in the world won't overcome your current self-doubt if you're stuck on a memory of a past failure. You may not have the luxury of engaging in a long, drawn out emotional process. Instead, acknowledge the inarguable facts and start from there. Be as realistic as possible about your goals, but don't stop believing in your dreams. Persistence is your secret weapon in your battle against the clock."
capricorn,2015-08-03,"It might seem as if the group process is hampering your progress today. Or it's possible that people are really working against your efforts. Instead of trying to lead everyone along on your chosen path, you might have to give up your high expectations of harmonious teamwork. Don't be afraid to separate yourself from the pack. You can't get around the complexity when multiple points of view are involved. Thankfully, you can clarify your own trajectory by setting firm boundaries and sticking to your agenda."
aquarius,2015-08-03,"Your career objectives may be in direct conflict with your personal goals now. Your job-related duties prevent you from connecting with those you love in the way you wish. Unfortunately, you must make choices because you can only spread yourself so thin. Normally, you could rely on the advice of others to help you with your dilemma, but they are likely to encourage you to follow your heart. Nevertheless, the logical solution is to accept that it's appropriate to refocus on work for the time being. Once you can measure your professional progress, you'll have more time to revitalize your personal life."
pisces,2015-08-03,"Putting all your eggs in one basket might seem necessary, yet success comes at a high price now. If you want to shine professionally, you have to prove you have the determination and discipline to reach your goals. Unfortunately, you may be distracted by a string of unimportant diversions that steal your time. However, no one is taking anything from you; it's your decision where to focus your awareness. You're standing at a fork in the road; consider the pros and cons of each path before picking the one that suits you best."
aries,2015-08-04,"You're able to step directly into the flow of events today, even if you don't know what you're doing. The lovely Venus-Jupiter conjunction blesses your 5th House of Fun and Games, making it nearly impossible to miss the beneficial effects of this cosmic gift. Although you can inspire others with your soaring optimism, you may try to take the everything-is-wonderful approach too far. An unexpected twist of fate might be a wake-up call from your future, reminding you to keep everything in proper perspective. When life hands you lemonade, you should be grateful and drink it."
taurus,2015-08-04,"It's nearly impossible for anyone to bring you down today while delicious Venus is cavorting with jolly Jupiter in your 4th House of Security. Ironically, everyone doesn't share your excitement and your unrestrained optimism may put someone else in distress. Thankfully, it doesn't take much effort on your part to curb your enthusiasm just a little. You can make a positive impression now, but no one likes a know-it-all. Express your heartfelt joy in a supportive manner while still being mindful of others."
gemini,2015-08-04,"You may be happy with your current mode of operation today, even if you have to deal with mundane annoyances such as paying bills and juggling one-too-many responsibilities.

Your flexible attitude works in your favor as long as you resist assuming your method is best. Practicing humility is your key to success."
cancer,2015-08-04,"You may be rather lazy today, even though your senses are wide awake. Opulent Jupiter dances with luscious Venus in your 2nd House of Self-Worth, filling your life with feelings of abundance and pleasure. Happily, too much of a good thing still seems pretty darn good today, as if you can overdo without suffering the consequences. Unfortunately, you can't escape the effects of overindulgence, but you might decide it's worth it. Revel in your good fortune while the lucky stars are on your side."
leo,2015-08-04,"It's as if you're a magician today, effortlessly pulling one cute rabbit after another out of thin air. You make everything look so easy now because you're having such a good time demonstrating your charming wit and spirit of generosity. However, turning a clever thought or poetic turn of phrase into something more practical could be a challenge. Thankfully, there's no reason to struggle. If you let go of your attachment to a specific outcome and stay open to all the possibilities, your chances for success are endless."
virgo,2015-08-04,"You're tempted to gloss over a significant fact today if you think reality might get in the way of your big plans. Normally, you're quite attentive to the details, but you may be more concerned with fulfilling a pleasurable fantasy now, even if you must temporarily dance around the truth. Fortunately, your integrity prevents you from stepping too far out of line. Additionally, you don't want to waste time later cleaning up from a lapse of good judgment. Nevertheless, a bit of self-indulgence is good for your soul."
libra,2015-08-04,"You could go overboard when expressing your generosity toward others today as the delightful Venus-Jupiter conjunction sweetens your 11th House of Friends and Associates. It's all too easy to overcome any self-doubt that may be stirred if you are putting your reputation on the line. In fact, the possible rewards seem so great that justifying the risk isn't difficult at all. However, it's still wise to think through your plans before you do something that you might soon regret. Exercising a little common sense enables your random acts of kindness to have the greatest impact."
scorpio,2015-08-04,"A well-meaning person could enter your life now, offering you a business opportunity or an unexpected chance to further your career. Receiving a generous gift is another possible manifestation of the auspicious Venus-Jupiter conjunction that graces your 10th House of Status. You could be pleasantly surprised no matter what happens. Of course, there's never any cosmic guarantees, but be ready to gratefully accept whatever good news arrives at your doorstep today. Don't hesitate; open the door and let it in."
sagittarius,2015-08-04,"It's easier to re-evaluate your future plans than to actually motivate yourself today to make a move. However, you're willing to take a leap of faith and say yes if something sounds intriguing while the promising Venus-Jupiter conjunction shines in your 9th House of Adventure. Nevertheless, success comes at a cost now, and there still may be a few surprises along the way. The potential is great if you exercise good judgment. Managing your obligations early in the day frees you up to respond to an unexpected opportunity with open arms."
capricorn,2015-08-04,Support comes out of left field today as friendly Venus joins propitious Jupiter in your 8th House of Shared Resources. Collaborating with others is a win-win proposition because nearly anything you do now serves to further your long-term goals. Your ambitious nature is currently your greatest asset. Don't be overly concerned if you can't figure out where the opportunities might lead. All you need to do is climb on the bandwagon and enjoy the ride. A grateful mind is a powerful mind.
aquarius,2015-08-04,"Your current success depends on your ability to combine your unique creativity with your persuasive charm. Working with those who share your passions is your ticket to happiness as the harmonious Venus-Jupiter conjunction highlights your 7th House of Partners. Friends and associates bring much-needed skills and resources to the table, paving a clear path to your goals. Oddly enough, pursuing the pleasure principle may be the key to attracting those who can help you the most."
pisces,2015-08-04,"Relaxing doesn't feel like a viable option today, especially if you are swept up in the anticipation of what's right around the next corner. Even if something wonderful at work catches you off guard, it's still challenging to stop long enough to let the experience sink in. Luckily, you can make a conscious decision to soak in the sweetness of the present moment instead of immediately returning to the task at hand. Stop to appreciate the power of now; mix work with play when you are given the chance."
aries,2015-08-05,"You might not easily accept the fact that you can't have everything you want now. Satisfaction grows even more elusive if you expect others to fulfill your needs. Anger can sneak into the equation if you're not careful today. But don't toss blame around if you're feeling frustrated; striking out against someone else only pushes them away. Instead, hard work or strenuous exercise is a healthier outlet for your bottled-up tension. You'll be a lot more fun to be around if you're not ready to explode at any given moment. Breathe; this too shall pass."
taurus,2015-08-05,"Your efforts to socialize today may be met with a cool reception. Although you might believe someone is purposefully setting obstacles in your path, making a significant connection isn't out of the question. Cold Saturn's stressful square to warm Venus requires you to set aside your fantasies for a while. Fortunately, putting in the extra effort that builds a strong foundation improves the chances of creating an enduring relationship. There's no free lunch when it comes to love."
gemini,2015-08-05,"Your clever wit naturally gives you a distinct advantage when it comes to having a good time. However, you may be too anxious to fully enjoy yourself today. You could be so concerned about losing your goodies that you unconsciously clench your jaw in fear. Unfortunately, holding your breath only produces the opposite effect of what you really want. This stress is inconsequential in the larger scheme of things and you can change the atmosphere by simply relaxing into the present moment. Counting your blessings is the quickest way to remember what you value most."
cancer,2015-08-05,"You may be afraid that your happiness is about to slip through your fingers. Unfortunately, you can easily succumb to this self-induced uncertainty and withdraw from close encounters with those you love. However, a better strategy might be to face your demons and consciously overcome your instinctive resistance. The more awareness you shine on your hidden feelings, the more lighthearted you'll feel about life in general. Mustering the courage to engage your worries empowers you to conquer them."
leo,2015-08-05,"Pulling back into the safety of your home and family may be your most sensible move as the tides of change wash upon your shore. You might be feeling a sense of urgency, but won't likely lose your chance to find fulfillment if you don't jump to act today. In fact, you have an excellent opportunity to tie up loose emotional ends now so that you can launch into a new cycle in the days ahead. Reconnecting with those you love does your heart good."
virgo,2015-08-05,"You have a realistic handle on your emotions today, but with your new focus comes the need to take decisive action. The bad news is you may be pulled in the direction of separation now, rather than connection. The good news is you have the potential of fixing something that's been bothering you for a while, but it requires you to reveal your vulnerability first. Ultimately, listening to your heart won't lead you astray when it comes to manifesting your dreams."
libra,2015-08-05,"Financial troubles may be a sign that you've been neglecting your responsibilities lately. But the stress you feel might not be limited to money since it also raises issues of your own self-worth, especially pertaining to love and relationships. If your confidence takes a hit, don't waste time worrying about what others think or say about you. You need to be your own biggest fan if you want to create the best possible outcome."
scorpio,2015-08-05,The expectations of loved ones can generate emotional pressure and their needs are so over-the-top now that you're tempted to run for the hills. Your sense of alienation might be exasperated by the lack of support from those who profess to be on your side. Keep in mind that your current experience may be heavily influenced by memories of difficult times. Forgive and then let go of the past; healing is only possible when you're truly ready to move on.
sagittarius,2015-08-05,"Suppressing a sudden rush of emotions might seem totally unnecessary to you. However, others could be overwhelmed by your energetic onslaught now if you release pent-up feelings without any self-restraint. Luckily, your uncharacteristically practical vision of the future can pull you out of a downward spiral today. Do what you do best: aim your thoughts at an impossible goal and then defy all odds by taking the high road to reach your destination."
capricorn,2015-08-05,"You may believe that it's a smart idea to avoid your friends today, as you move through a period of self-imposed isolation. Although the idea of socializing might seem as if it could boost your morale, conversations fall short of your high expectations now. Don't be too self-judgmental; a bit of quality alone time offers you a rare opportunity to listen to your inner voice. Blocking out the extraneous noise enables the wisdom of your soul to be clearly heard."
aquarius,2015-08-05,"Your first order of business today is delivering on your recent promises. Responsibility calls, even if you prefer to be spending your time with others while pleasure-seeking Venus is revisiting your 7th House of Relationships. Reality is your taskmaster now and you must do what's being asked of you, which means you have to temporarily set aside your notion of personal satisfaction. Thankfully, applying yourself in a disciplined and industrious manner increases the chances of fulfillment down the road."
pisces,2015-08-05,"It feels as if your current actions won't alleviate your sense of disappointment, no matter what you do. Thankfully, it isn't the end of the world if you have to postpone your plans to make a dream come true. Don't assume this delay is a cancellation; you're just putting a potential adventure on hold so you can make it perfect. In the meantime, patiently tend to the most pressing issues on your plate today; ironically, you might actually fix whatever prevented you from reaching your goals in the first place."
aries,2015-08-06,"You're ready to settle down and put your nose to the grindstone as taskmaster Saturn pushes your key planet Mars into action. Nevertheless, it's challenging to limit unnecessary distractions as one temptation appears after another. But rather than wasting time pursuing transient pleasure, be responsible and focus on the specific projects in front of you now. Committing to a strict schedule is required today if you want to reach your goals."
taurus,2015-08-06,"A familiar wave of practicality washes away the heightened intensity of the past few days. You may breathe a big sigh of relief now that the Moon is chilling out in your even-tempered sign. However, there is still plenty of work to do, leaving you little time to grow complacent. Luckily, your actions are on target today, enabling you to deliver on your promises and, perhaps, even exceed everyone's expectations. Your dependable nature is appreciated more than you know."
gemini,2015-08-06,"You are pulled in many directions as you attempt to sort out the most productive way to move through such a busy day. Although you're eager to pursue experiences that pique your interest, you don't have time to follow every compelling lead. You may be excessively talkative today, only to be criticized for your lack of focus. Take responsibility for your actions, make tough choices and limit your explanations. Achieving balance is complicated now, yet carefully considering your decisions before you make them assures the best possible outcome."
cancer,2015-08-06,"Your associates may not see past your hard-working exterior today, but your feelings are running strong, nonetheless. Take several deep breaths and contemplate what form of expression works best for you, rather than just running on automatic pilot. It's all too easy to get swept up into doing what's expected, even if you must hide what's most important to you. If anyone pressures you to step too far out of your comfort zone now, set clear boundaries before things get messy. Your destiny is in your own hands."
leo,2015-08-06,"A melodrama begins to fade today as your common sense grows stronger by the hour. You aren't interested in being sidetracked by someone's emotionally intense story, especially one that seems to go nowhere useful. Instead, work toward improving your life by being as productive as you can. Once you fulfill your responsibilities, choose rejuvenating rest over frivolous activities. Conserving your energy is your only viable strategy now if you want to have enough stamina to see your commitments through to the end. Inch by inch it's a cinch; yard by yard it's hard."
virgo,2015-08-06,"Efficiently managing your internal world now is a necessary part of putting your external affairs in order. Your current attitude sets the stage for your future success. Taking care of business will only get harder to handle as the days fly by if you let yourself become overwhelmed today. Although an I-can-do-it frame of mind is necessary, positive thinking isn't enough now. Pitch in and do your share; ultimately, relying on your industrious nature is your most reliable tactic for achieving your goals."
libra,2015-08-06,"People may be overly critical about your work today as retrograde Venus joins gossipy Mercury in your 11th House of Teamwork. Instead of letting others rattle your cage, improve your game by applying the valuable feedback you receive. There's no time to get discouraged by anyone else's judgments. Thankfully, counting on your common sense helps you to avoid taking any comments too personally. Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder."
scorpio,2015-08-06,"You want everyone to accept your authority without question now while the planetary emphasis is on your 10th House of Public Status. However, stern Saturn's square has you wondering whether or not you're actually on the politically correct side of an issue. Nevertheless, it's not enough to be right; you also want people to appreciate you for your brilliant competence. Rather than inflating your expectations, keep your plans simple today and then do your best to make them real. Your unwavering determination enables you to work your magic and charm your audience."
sagittarius,2015-08-06,"You're reticent to reveal your innermost feelings today but, thankfully, people might not even notice. It's not that you are carrying around dark secrets; you're just trying to prevent professional relationships from growing more complicated. Consider the potential impact of your words prior to sharing too much information. Practicing a bit of self-restraint now is less stressful than dealing with the negative consequences afterward. Discretion is your friend."
capricorn,2015-08-06,"You are tempted to run out on your commitments and chase more pleasurable pursuits. Although you might not be able to act on the spur of the moment to join in the fun, you can still schedule time for socializing into your day. Ironically, it's easier to enjoy yourself now if you can delicately balance your demanding responsibilities with playful activities. As paradoxical as it sounds, establishing an agenda allows you to be more spontaneous."
aquarius,2015-08-06,"Playing nicely with others today propels you along your professional path. However, don't get so wrapped up in your own ambitions that you aren't sensitive to the objectives of the group. However, there's no reason to completely set aside your needs in deference to the preferences of your coworkers. Finding common ground enables you to do your own thing while still following the rules of the game."
pisces,2015-08-06,"Focusing on your work can be a real challenge today when you have so many thoughts running around in your brain like the proverbial hamster in a wheel. You are wise to channel your internal chatter into creative outlets, instead of wasting your energy trying to silence it. Don't worry if your coworkers think you're too serious; you have bigger concerns now that leave you little time for social niceties. Ultimately, your actions will speak volumes and others will be suitably impressed."
aries,2015-08-07,"You may have taken on one too many responsibilities but you're still so confident that you are ready to place even more on your to-do list today. Unfortunately, you could spend an inordinate amount of energy simply trying to fulfill your obligations, leaving you little time left to relax. But don't wait until the end of the day to wish you had less to complete. Judiciously cutting back on your activities sets healthy limits right from the get-go, enabling you to successfully balance work with play."
taurus,2015-08-07,"You assume your strategy is sound, but you still might discover you oversimplified your plan along the way. Your thoughts are a bit scattered today, even if your personal goals are crystal clear. Although you know that pleasure comes to those who wait, finding time for enjoyment is a luxury you don't have yet. But don't let discouragement bring you down; satisfaction will be yours as long as you keep your eyes on the prize."
gemini,2015-08-07,"Your schedule can get out of hand today as your key planet Mercury connects with excessive Jupiter. You could easily underestimate the time and energy required to finish a specific task. Although you may be temporarily overwhelmed, you should be able to pull it all together just in the nick of time. Don't complain, even if you regret how much you actually promised. Instead, keep your chin up and see this challenge as an opportunity to show others what you can do."
cancer,2015-08-07,"You might lose momentum today if you stop to think about everything that could go wrong with your plans. Reality is testing you to see if you can overcome the obstacles that pop up in your path. Fortunately, your inner strength gives you clarity of vision now so you can organize many disparate puzzle pieces into a comprehensive picture. Although your friends show up to support your efforts, it's up to you to graciously accept the assistance that's offered. A shared burden is easier to bear."
leo,2015-08-07,"The emotional landscape is rapidly changing now and it's nearly impossible to know how you're going to feel next. Oddly enough, you seem to vacillate between possessing superpowers and being a mere mortal. You might actually be able to leap tall thoughts in a single bound; however, you still have to follow through with sensible action. There's nothing wrong with having your head in the clouds if you remember to keep your feet on the ground at the same time."
virgo,2015-08-07,"You seem like a production engine now and you're capable of achieving more than anyone can imagine. Luckily, your steadfast commitment to your goals is likely to be positively acknowledged by others. However, you could be so enamored with your big plans that your overconfidence becomes your downfall. Don't accept more responsibilities than you can realistically manage.

libra,2015-08-07,"You could be a case study in demonstrating the power of positive thought. It's as if you're on some sort of productive high now and might even be able to imagine something right into existence. It's too bad your sunny confidence can't be bottled and saved for a rainy day. However, the muse is fickle and you will land yourself into trouble if you just assume you can sustain a steady pace. Give yourself a bit of leeway today; allow yourself to meander and don't be afraid to daydream along the way. All those who wander are not lost."
scorpio,2015-08-07,"You might not have time to play, even if there's potential fun dangling right in front of your nose. You want to enjoy the company of others, but it's not prudent to avoid responsibilities that you already accepted. Acknowledging the limitations of what you can't do in the present moment allows you to be freer to pursue pleasure or explore the meaning of life without the added burden of having to please everyone else. Promise less; deliver more."
sagittarius,2015-08-07,"You may be caught up in the residual tension of a power struggle today as you continue to navigate the changes that are being demanded of you. But the more you attempt to cling to the status quo, the more complicated the conflict grows. However, if your commitment to a social cause is more important than achieving your personal goals, you can gracefully dance your way through the resistance. Leave your ego at the door when you're working for the greater good."
capricorn,2015-08-07,"You're feeling a bit under the weather today, making it challenging to step past self-imposed restrictions. Nevertheless, you're eager to take advantage of the exciting opportunities calling your name. You could learn something valuable if you don't retreat back to your safety zone too soon.

Summon your courage; life isn't a battle, it's an adventure."
aquarius,2015-08-07,"Someone may present such an amazing idea today that it's hard to say no. However, you might be feeling so positive now that nearly every opportunity seems like a worthwhile one. It really doesn't matter if you're invited to participate in a business deal or attend a private party; the event probably sounds better than it actually is. But there's no good reason to react negatively; just remain open to modifying your position as more of the truth is unveiled. Entertaining all your options enables you to make the best choice in the end."
pisces,2015-08-07,"You believe you're seeing the entire picture now, but you may be sadly mistaken. Unfortunately, precision thinking isn't conducive to a vision quest. You can imagine a highly complex scenario, but just as easily, you could also get sidetracked with all the details. You will probably choose to act upon your new opportunity today because you're eager to turn over a new leaf. Just remember not to over-commit your resources or you might end up regretting your decision. Dream big, but start small."
aries,2015-08-08,"A never-ending string of distractions makes for an extremely busy day. But rather than growing tired from the steady barrage of activity, all the twists and turns just seem to make your life more interesting. Nevertheless, it's wise to delay important decisions because your judgment could be slightly impaired now. Relax and enjoy the unplanned events this weekend, even if your previous plans unravel in the process. Sometimes magic hides behind chaos."
taurus,2015-08-08,"You're capable of untangling the intricacies of financial planning today, so it makes sense to attend to money management while your thinking is so sharp. Unfortunately, you may be required to iron out a problem that's exacerbated by your temptation to spend too much cash. But the current issues also involve your emotional relationship to your possessions. Stick with your logical approach to move past whatever is standing in your way of material success."
gemini,2015-08-08,"You may start the day as an irrepressible optimist but the power of positive thinking gradually slips away. The mentally agile Gemini Moon squares trickster Mercury, challenging you to maintain a healthy perspective on new projects or adventures. Although cultivating an I-can-do-it attitude is empowering, too much self-confidence lures you in over your head before you remember that you can't swim. Thankfully, you can avoid trouble later by acting cautiously and treading water now."
cancer,2015-08-08,"Although you might chat up a storm today, you're keeping the most significant topics locked up behind your emotional firewall. However, protecting yourself from potential hurt could also add to your current loneliness. But you're not one to confuse flirtatious dialogue with the heartfelt communication that leads to intimacy. Don't let your insecurities stop you from sharing your secrets. Find a way to interact with your friends without closing down your heart."
leo,2015-08-08,"Although you're sometimes called Lucky Leo, your current good fortune is more about your positive attitude and your ability to find the silver lining in nearly any dark cloud. Thankfully, your friends are rallying around you to support your dreams. The sweet thing is you don't have to do much of anything today, other than remaining open to the assistance coming your way. Count your blessings and soak in the love while you have the chance."
virgo,2015-08-08,"People see you as more gregarious today, but in reality social chit-chat annoys you most of the time. Nevertheless, you can still get so wrapped up in trivial conversations and superfluous activities now that you are distracted from your real work. Don't fight the inevitable; let go of your agenda and return to it tomorrow once the noise quiets down. Taking life less seriously for a while gives you the chance to put your feet up and catch your breath."
libra,2015-08-08,"You might be planning your getaway to an exotic location in great detail, whether or not your imagined vacation is practical. You deserve a quick escape after the challenges you have recently experienced. Start talking about your next adventure today, even if it seems like a pipe dream at the moment. Remember, you're greasing the wheels and putting a larger chain of events into motion that could culminate in your travel fantasies coming true."
scorpio,2015-08-08,"The deeper you dig today, the easier it will be to navigate through the tangle of weeds that appear to hold your life together. However, taking the next step is harder when you're stuck in place. Thankfully, you can see the truth from just about every angle, so with a little detective work you should be able to figure out how to move forward. Remain true to what you know and incorporate what you learn now into your values. Trust your intuition to guide your way."
sagittarius,2015-08-08,"It might feel as if there's too much drama going on around you today, but the  events in your environment aren't as important as what's going on within your own heart. If you  stay aware of the complex dilemmas going on within your relationships you will come out on top. Thankfully, as you address your inner issues, external ones become less scary. Calm your irrational fears so that they can't take root. Your personal growth is best served when you have the courage to be honest."
capricorn,2015-08-08,"You could take on more than you can possibly finish because you tend to overestimate your capabilities today. However, your optimism can't last once you realize there are not enough hours in the day to finish everything. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to determine a strategy that makes the best out of a difficult situation. The worst thing you can do is try to hide your uncertainty. People will be sympathetic if you're honest about your limitations. After all, you're an imperfect human just like everyone else. Laugh at yourself and lighten up."
aquarius,2015-08-08,"It's like you're on a rocket ship that cannot quite accelerate fast enough to reach escape velocity today. It's all too easy to become frustrated if you don't achieve all your goals. Fortunately, you can still do amazing work, even if you fall short of your initial destination. There's no reason to be discouraged as long as you give it your best shot. Tomorrow is another day."
pisces,2015-08-08,"Your intentions may be misunderstood today but the gulf between you and others grows wider the more you talk. Nevertheless, silence is not a viable option because you can't seem to rein in your current loquacious tendencies. Every thought has the potential to become an entire song and dance routine. Ironically, your confidence doesn't waver, even if you're having trouble making your position known. Quit trying to justify your actions; simply let everyone know your feelings on the subject and then shut up and smile."
aries,2015-08-09,"Theoretically, you should be able to find plenty of time to rest today. However, you have chores to finish and it seems that the faster you go now, the less you accomplish. Nevertheless, awareness is the key to change. Once you understand the underlying dynamic, you can slow down your external response to emotional news even if you have an immediate reaction. Don't over-commit by putting too much on your calendar when the universe is telling you to relax."
taurus,2015-08-09,"It's not like you're being unreasonable; you simply want to carve out some personal time at home today. You like the notion of being free to do things your own way, but you could run into obstacles when family members make their needs known. The fact of the matter is your current happiness depends upon your ability to meet others halfway, even if you feel like resisting at first. Thankfully, the adaptable Gemini Moon is ready to ride to your rescue now, inspiring you to make the best of any situation."
gemini,2015-08-09,"Being keenly aware of your feelings today is unavoidable while the reflective Moon travels through your sign. But peace of mind isn't dependent on sharing every whim and expressing every fleeting emotion. Nevertheless, exercising caution can counteract the possibility of reacting too quickly as a situation unfolds. Focusing on a specific goal enables you to accomplish more now than running off in several directions all at once. Let discernment be your guide."
cancer,2015-08-09,"People see you as emotionally calmer today, but your fantasies are running nonstop while the evocative Moon lights up your 12th House of Escapism. In fact, your inner life could be so captivating now that you need to retreat from everyone else. Ironically, your withdrawal might be why others think you're more serene than you actually feel. Nevertheless, maintaining your social connections while simultaneously enjoying your fertile imagination allows you to get the best of both worlds."
leo,2015-08-09,"Although you want to kick up your heels and dance the day away, you're worried that your time may be better spent preparing for an upcoming important event. However, obsessing about a future commitment won't actually improve your prospects. You can only control so much from a distance. Meanwhile, energetic Mars joins in the lively Leo party of planets, encouraging you to make the most of the present moment. Catch the wave while you can; play now, pay later."
virgo,2015-08-09,"There are many alluring possibilities vying for your attention today, and you could exhaust yourself trying to explore all of them. Proceed carefully or you might suddenly decide to surrender and just say yes to everyone else's demands. Nevertheless, it's still wiser to reconsider your options before responding to the changing dynamics. Maintaining your sense of humor helps more than you may think; laughter is the best medicine."
libra,2015-08-09,"Making one too many plans ends up triggering a serious headache now because everything continues to shift and change in spite of your wishes. Don't pack your schedule too tightly; instead, give yourself enough elbow room to act in the moment. Paradoxically, adopting a more spontaneous approach stabilizes your world and improves your productivity. Your legendary ambivalence actually works in your favor on a day when the wind blows in so many directions."
scorpio,2015-08-09,"Strange winds are blowing weird thoughts into your awareness from distant times and other dimensions. You are a magnet for unusual occurrences that elude rational comprehension. Nevertheless, even the smallest dose of trust goes a long way now; you may be happily surprised once you soften your boundaries. Don't worry about the current uncertainty; you don't have to do anything except remain open to the unexpected vagaries of change."
sagittarius,2015-08-09,"Everyone in your world seems to be moving faster than you, and the frenetic pace tempts you to make a quick escape. However, everything is relative and you may just be moving slower today, making others appear impatient with your progress. Working with friends sounds good on paper, but you might not be able to keep up with them now. Unfortunately, the chaos around you could be a reflection of your  boredom. Face the music; embrace the spontaneity and make it your own."
capricorn,2015-08-09,"You may be feeling under a ton of pressure today as you approach an important deadline or the end of a long-term project. But forcing a resolution where there's a difference of opinion only frustrates you more and impedes your progress. Although you might want to experiment with a radical solution, take a few steps back now and breathe deeply so you can better appreciate the blessings you already have in your life. The urgency is relative; it's all about shifting your perspective to one of gratitude."
aquarius,2015-08-09,"You're ready for fun and frivolities now that the Moon is prancing in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Unfortunately, everyone seems to have very different ideas about how to celebrate  now. Naturally, you can't force anyone to join you in your game if they're set on playing a different one. Luckily, there's no reason to overreact and postpone your pursuit of pleasure. Instead of assuming that it's your way or the highway, remain open-minded about other people's ideas of a good time. Plan less for the future and live more in the here and now."
pisces,2015-08-09,"You are entranced by someone's cheery disposition today, only to find yourself being lured in a totally different direction a short time later. Nevertheless, you continue to look for another alternative because your current choices seem so similar in the light of day. In an act of desperation, you might even entertain the notion that you can simultaneously follow multiple paths. However, the truth is all roads lead into the future and that's the only thing that matters now. Explore every possibility that comes to mind and then follow the course of least resistance."
aries,2015-08-10,"Don't fall victim to believing that you can do everything today. You may be shocked when you realize you've been so busy lately putting out fires that you forgot to do something that was quite important. Hopefully, you discover your omission early enough in the day to remedy the situation before things grow out of hand. Make a conscious decision to reassess your priorities prior to running into trouble. With a little forethought and discretion you can use this cosmic burst of energy to your advantage."
taurus,2015-08-10,"You might assume that a cautious approach to scheduling your time will prevent any logistical issues from spoiling your day. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to think of everything in advance. Don't worry if something urgent pops up unexpectedly today. Rather than reacting fearfully, consider what this new situation can teach you and remain as open as possible to a radical change of direction. Integrating a different perspective places you in an even stronger position now than where you were before."
gemini,2015-08-10,"Your emotions are changing so rapidly that it's too complicated to explain what you're feeling each moment. However, by the time you attempt to share your emotions, they have already begun to shift. You may try to talk really fast to anyone who will listen because you're anxious to catch the wave; unfortunately, this fear-based strategy will only add to your frustration. Paradoxically, saying less will help you gather your thoughts so you can speak with more authority later on when it matters."
cancer,2015-08-10,"It's not easy to be very patient today because you're expecting something wonderful to happen at work. The Moon's return to your sign is emotionally empowering, but you're still not likely to tell others what you need. You see no reason to waste time with words when a straightforward approach of incisive action will lead you directly to your goal. Don't miss this cosmically blessed opportunity to pursue your ambitions and reach for the stars."
leo,2015-08-10,"Although a variety of social activities has kept you hopping during the past few days, you might feel the need to crawl back under the covers today after the emotional Moon enters your 12th House of Privacy. But even if you long to be alone, you can still benefit greatly from collaborating with others now. Shutting yourself off from the rest of the world isn't your best move even if it sounds tempting in the moment; instead, find something exciting to do that you can't help but want to share with your peers."
virgo,2015-08-10,"You can be incredibly picky when choosing your friends, but letting down your guard is no problem at all once you give your stamp of approval. In fact, your openness can be rather disarming today as you shift gears instantaneously. Others might be quite surprised if they judge you too quickly by your appearance because your aloofness disappears once you make the choice to warm up. Nevertheless, don't wait too long to show your interest or it could end up being too late. Trust your psychic radar and don't be afraid to say yes."
libra,2015-08-10,"You aren't interested in taking on any extra responsibilities today, prompting you to distance yourself from coworkers who place too many demands on you. You prefer someone else to be in charge now so people won't depend on you so much. Unfortunately, it's not so easy to avoid new obligations, especially if you recently led others to assume you would be there for them in a pinch. However, you can derive emotional satisfaction once you stop resisting the pressure to perform your job; take the high road and rise to the occasion, instead."
scorpio,2015-08-10,"You might have a case of the jitters today, yet engaging in physical activity doesn't seem to calm your fidgety nerves. Unfortunately, you won't be able to work off your excess energy by throwing yourself into a job. In fact, pursuing creative endeavors might be your best chance for finding any peace now. Proving your worth by being productive is a misguided strategy; focus on the things that bring you pleasure, instead. You can always return to your unfinished projects tomorrow after your clarity returns and your heart is blissfully content."
sagittarius,2015-08-10,"You are weary of trying to compete with people who are so wrapped up with their perfect performances that they miss the point. You have even less patience today for those folks who don't share your goals or values. Rather than pretending to be interested in things that don't matter to you, reserve your energy for more meaningful interactions. One deeply moving connection is more emotionally satisfying now than any number of trivial ones."
capricorn,2015-08-10,"You feel a dramatic shift in your energy today as superficial conversations with coworkers start to make your skin crawl. Although you're often more likely to engage in a pragmatic discussion, the nurturing Cancer Moon reveals your softer and sweeter side. Don't worry about people thinking you're weak for expressing your feelings. If you take a risk and surprise others with your emotional honesty, they might just respond in a similar fashion. It's up to you to get the ball rolling and see who wants to play."
aquarius,2015-08-10,"Although you may not be actively seeking new information now, you still might be confronted with a radical idea that contradicts your prior assumptions about relationships. Today's news could temporarily turn your life inside out as shocking Uranus rattles Mercury the Messenger. However, once you realize the truth, you'll be grateful that you had the courage to change your point of view. The future is calling, even if you're tempted to retreat to the security of the past. Anticipation will win out in the end."
pisces,2015-08-10,"You recently obtained a surprising scoop on someone you know and can't help but wonder if it is true. However, it's critical to consider the source of any incoming data so you can discern whether or not it's worthy of your attention. Refrain from saying anything prematurely today; if you're unsure about the validity of the facts, then bite your tongue until you know the whole story. Once something is spoken aloud, it's impossible to take it back. Maintain your integrity and err on the side of discretion for the sake of all involved."
aries,2015-08-11,Establishing healthy habits over the months ahead produces benefits that can last a lifetime. Patterns you thought could never be broken seem easy to change now that auspicious Jupiter is rocking your 6th House of Daily Routine. There's no reason to delay improving your lifestyle since you must be at your optimum health to manage all the work ahead. Make the necessary modifications and you'll have the energy in reserve when you need it down the road. Clean living does a body good.
taurus,2015-08-11,"Life is a blessing while prosperous Jupiter journeys through your 5th House of Love and Creativity. If you stay on the practical side of the tracks, you could actually have a lot of fun doing whatever is required of you now. But the fact of the matter is the real objective is not material; it's all about your attitude. It's time to let your inner child out to play without worrying about undue judgment from others. People encourage you to express your true colors today. Happily, you can let your imagination flow without fear of losing ground."
gemini,2015-08-11,"Normally, you're a champion when it comes to holding two points of view at the same time. However, you're ready to choose the quiet solitude of your inner world now over the noisy distractions of the outside world. Jovial Jupiter's yearlong visit to your 4th House of Domestic Conditions strengthens family ties and encourages personal growth over career advancement. It's time to clear up unresolved domestic matters and settle old emotional scores. Remember, home is where your heart is."
cancer,2015-08-11,"You're going to need clever time management skills more than ever. Expansive Jupiter is moving through your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, amplifying your desire to be in the midst of the action. You're entering a whole new phase where communication becomes top priority in your relationship world. However, you may be focusing too much on analyzing all the details in advance. This obsessive strategy is fine as long as you don't let your head talk you out of your feelings. Keep your heart in the game and everything will be alright."
leo,2015-08-11,Your entrepreneurial skills can make you some serious money this year as abundant Jupiter struts his stuff in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. Jupiter magnified a variety of various facets of your life for the past year as it traveled through your sign. The bad news is you might be feeling so confident now that you take a risk and overreach your mark. The good news is that a careful reassessment of your financial goals paves the way to future prosperity.
virgo,2015-08-11,"This is the end of one opportunity cycle and the exciting beginning of another. In fact, it might really feel like ""today is the first day of the rest of your life."" Just remember that it could take many months for the current dynamics to reveal their long-range trajectory. Don't get discouraged because you can't do everything right away. Stay on your toes because new chances for personal growth will pop up throughout the year and it's your job to grab them. Happy days are here again; you can't go wrong now that lucky Jupiter is making hay in your sign."
libra,2015-08-11,"It's as if you're getting assistance from behind the scenes, whether there are allies working on your behalf or angels riding to your rescue as they perform their magic in other dimensions. Good fortune is yours now, but it's no simple task to determine the source of your luck. Bountiful Jupiter spends the next year wandering through your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, so don't waste time lost in analysis. Sometimes just acknowledging the truth is enough. Say a little prayer of thanks and move on."
scorpio,2015-08-11,"Your dreams are coming true right before your eyes, but you still have to show up and play your part. You might be so idealistic now that you think you can change the world. However, a lack of perspective is your undoing if you actually attempt to do the impossible. Don't underestimate the powerful influence of the people in your life as giant Jupiter moves and shakes in your 11th House of Social Networking. Accept invitations to mix and mingle when given the chance; there's a distinct possibility you'll learn something of value, meet someone important and open up a few doors of your own."
sagittarius,2015-08-11,"Finding middle ground when it comes to your career this year is challenging all on its own. Opportunistic Jupiter's presence in your 10th House of Public Life can bring greater success than you ever imagined. However, gaining professional recognition comes with a cost; focusing on external goals doesn't leave a lot of room for spiritual and emotional growth. Don't worry; there will be time for personal aspirations after you pursue your ambitions. For now, go big or go home."
capricorn,2015-08-11,"Your current desire to expand your world view makes this a fantastic year to travel to places you've never been. Fortunately, your mind is open to new experiences now that philosophical Jupiter is gallivanting through your 9th House of Adventure. There's a lot to gain from social interactions with people from different ethnic or religious backgrounds. Think globally; take any action that widens your perspective, regardless of how large or small. Pick a destination and explore to your heart's content."
aquarius,2015-08-11,"Paying attention to the subtle nuances of changing feelings can open doors to new levels of intimacy in a significant relationship. But fortuitous Jupiter's yearlong visit to your 8th House of Shared Resources is also a harbinger of financial opportunities. Prosperity may arrive at your doorstep through someone else's generosity, but it's up to you to graciously receive it. This is no time for modesty; abundance is yours for the taking."
pisces,2015-08-11,"One-on-one encounters are blessed this year as propitious Jupiter travels through your 7th House of Partnerships. In fact, your life could blossom if you have the good sense to nurture an intriguing idea someone brings to you now. However, even the most amazing opportunities require you to focus on a very specific goal. Success depends upon your ability to narrow your field of activity and the sooner you eliminate extraneous activities, the quicker you will see positive results."
aries,2015-08-12,"You are highly motivated to find ways to express the colorful images running through your mind today. Nevertheless, your current desire to escape from reality makes it tough to follow through with your chores because you would rather be daydreaming more than anything else. It can be quite complicated to channel this surreal energy when issues from your subconscious float to the surface. Thankfully, quietly attending to your daily chores and fulfilling your obligations first frees you up to explore your imagination later on. Work now, wander in wonderland later."
taurus,2015-08-12,"Many things about your life appear differently to your friends than they do to you. Paradoxically, the more you attempt to reveal the true depth of your feelings today, the more you confuse everyone else. Fortunately, if you can rise above your need to set the record straight, you could be quite an inspiration to others. Ultimately, it's more rewarding to cooperate with your cohorts now than it is to be right. Choose harmony over discord if given the chance."
gemini,2015-08-12,"Your foggy brain may cloud your thinking today, but you can make the most of your creative buzz anyhow, if you watch out for a few potential pitfalls. You are unusually hypersensitive now with irrational feelings flooding into your thoughts; even your sensory impressions are temporarily overwhelming. Forget about mundane responsibilities like balancing your checkbook or planning the rest of your life. Write poetry, listen to music, and dream about your future, instead."
cancer,2015-08-12,"You secretly harbor fantasies of breaking loose and doing something entirely out of the box. Perhaps it's time to start envisioning your next getaway, especially if you haven't had a real vacation in a while. However, you must balance your dreams with realism now if you want them to come true. Don't be too self-critical if you can't figure out the logistics. Let your vision grow unencumbered by facts today; there will be time later on to color in all the details."
leo,2015-08-12,"You may be misled today by someone you trust. Although no one is out to purposefully trick you, others can inadvertently create confusion if they don't verify all their facts. Additionally, your logic is blurred by your own fantasies, whether they are about fame or fortune. Don't be distracted by unrealistic goals now that you have important business to handle. Forget about petty ego concerns and concentrate on the most practical matters on your plate."
virgo,2015-08-12,"Your analytical thinking may not be as sharp as you prefer while your ruling planet Mercury opposes nebulous Neptune. In fact, reality could be slightly beyond your grasp today with your mind working overtime in the realms of fantasy. Fortunately, your excursions into the dreamworld can be quite productive as long as you remember the difference between fact and fiction. Let your imagination feed your future."
libra,2015-08-12,"A vivid daydream may be so convincing that you almost believe it's true. Unfortunately, your logic isn't trustworthy now because your thinking is more subjective than you might realize. Instead of making an important decision at work today, consider all the possibilities without picking a favorite scenario. The current antidote is to do something enjoyable that gets you out of your head and into your body. Wait until tomorrow to return to the real work of setting priorities and planning your future."
scorpio,2015-08-12,"Your romantic landscape may seem quite cloudy today and fraught with traps of misunderstanding. It's up to you to be clear in all your communications, without necessarily being overly demanding about your needs. You could even fall in love with something or someone if you let your guard down. Tread carefully; it's probably safer to seek pleasure through creative pursuits now than from relationships because nothing is quite as it seems. Follow your bliss but don't sign any contracts."
sagittarius,2015-08-12,"You carry an air of spontaneity about you and your cheerful confidence, combined with your idealism, attracts compelling people into your life. Nevertheless, it's still hard to find an adventurous companion who shares your overall outlook on life. It's perfectly acceptable to say no to someone's generous offer. Limiting your options allows you to accomplish more in the long run. Dare to do things you never thought possible in your wildest dreams."
capricorn,2015-08-12,"It's disconcerting if you can't complete all your work on schedule. You have your sights aimed high, but you might be so unrealistic in your thinking now that you end up falling short of your mark. You want to feel free enough to follow your dreams but could grow disheartened if you think you need to be more practical in your approach. Don't rush; accept the notion that things will take longer than you prefer. Keep your hopes alive while moving forward slowly in the real world. Patience is a virtue to strive for today if you want true peace of mind."
aquarius,2015-08-12,"You may have some explaining to do about your radical approach to life, but you sound less and less convincing as you ramble on. Even if you don't intend on saying anything at all today, you still might be enticed into spilling all the beans before you know it. Unfortunately, your words can't paint the picture that you see in your mind's eye now, so craft your message carefully, make your point succinctly and then stop talking while you're ahead."
pisces,2015-08-12,"You're holding your unfulfilled dreams very close to the surface today while trying to keep up appearances so others aren't aware of your inner turbulence. Although your guarded behavior is actually an effective coping mechanism while on the job, you might inadvertently send out mixed messages. Practical analysis may be beyond your reach now, so don't try to hide behind emotionally detached logic. Surrounding yourself with supportive friends allows you the luxury of just being you."
aries,2015-08-13,"Curbing your enthusiasm sounds like a smart strategy today, but your excitement will probably overtake your common sense. Naturally, it's not wise to express everything you feel because some desires are better kept to yourself. You could stir up a hornet's nest if you broadcast your needs to everyone before reassessing the ramifications of your actions. Luckily, you still may be able to stretch the envelope as long as you stay aware of the larger circumstances and don't push your luck too far."
taurus,2015-08-13,"It's highly tempting when an unexpected event offers you the good fortune to participate in a mind-blowing activity. However, you're still likely to honor previous commitments and exhibit some self-restraint. Thankfully, you should be able to play both sides of the game and embark on the adventure as long as it doesn't upset family dynamics at home. Recent experiences increase your wisdom, but the window of opportunity to walk on the edge is closing. If you don't act quickly, you could lose this chance forever."
gemini,2015-08-13,"Ironically, a fortuitous twist to today's events can add to your concerns about your future, but there's no need to worry if you remain flexible about your current plans. Although it might feel as if you are at an impasse, the transition you have been dreaming about could occur without much resistance now. Your life is on the upswing, even it's not unfolding according to your timetable. Don't waste precious time reanalyzing your options; show your courage and take a giant leap of faith."
cancer,2015-08-13,"Your current fascination with being different reveals a surprising side of your personality. You may not be interested in the opinions of others now, so unsolicited advice won't have much impact on your current choices. This is the opportunity you've been anticipating; go ahead and act like the nonconformist you secretly want to be -- even if it's just for a day. The emotional satisfaction you earn is priceless and worth every penny."
leo,2015-08-13,"If you can't be the leader of your pack, you'll likely want to leave it and head out on your own. In any event, the same old routine is not appealing to you as the willful Sun in your sign syncs up with rebellious Uranus. Be insistent about your independence if you want to shake things up. Fortunately, if you share your plans with those you trust, you might be pleasantly surprised by their support. It's better to have allies in your corner, even if you ultimately need to travel your path alone."
virgo,2015-08-13,"You're wary of relying on others because you're afraid someone might do a disappearing act just as things get serious. Ultimately, the apparent instability of those around you may be a reflection of your unwillingness to participate in an unhealthy relationship. But you don't have to convince anyone to do your bidding now. It's your turn to star in your story instead of waiting for anyone else to steal the show. Shine, baby, shine."
libra,2015-08-13,"Sticking to your schedule isn't so simple today because unforeseen events make it nearly impossible to carry on with your original plans. Nevertheless, there's no reason to be agitated by things you cannot control. Let a few lower-priority projects slip for a day or two. Putting the pieces back together in a more constructive manner will be easier once you break the routine. Don't resist change now; there's a treasure to be found in the chaos if you're willing to experience it head on."
scorpio,2015-08-13,"Sometimes innovation requires hard work, yet inspiration seems to strike today without much effort on your part. Positive change is in the air, so stop trying to manage your life with worn-out rules. However, your plans might fall apart if you assume a laissez-faire attitude. Revise your playbook for the day and you'll gain the edge you need. Instead of just focusing on your own ambition, work out a strategy that's beneficial to everyone. Your progressive ideas and unconventional tactics can rock everyone's world."
sagittarius,2015-08-13,"There is a wide gulf between your need for emotional security and your craving for a new adventure. Your plans are being stress-tested by an anything-goes trine from wild Uranus to the brilliant Sun in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Unfortunately, your overconfidence might entice you to gamble foolishly on something that's not that important in the long run. Being a creative visionary is admirable, but not if you jeopardize your recent progress. Taking a calculated risk is worth it only if you consider all the variables first."
capricorn,2015-08-13,"A cosmic wake-up call rings through on all your digital devices today, reminding you to include others in your latest plans as electric Uranus trines the Sun in your 8th House of Shared Investments. Go ahead and reveal your best ideas -- even if they aren't ready for prime time yet -- with a possible partner. Someone who respects your integrity will see the positive potential in your thinking and will likely jump in to join your endeavors. The more the merrier; the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
aquarius,2015-08-13,"Somehow you can get away with the craziest of ideas today. In fact, you're quite skilled at taking an ingenious concept to a whole new level now. Your coworkers may urge you to put your thoughts into action, even if they want you to modify some details of your plan first. This is dangerous territory because accommodating someone else's concerns could actually weaken your strategy. But walking away might be a bigger mistake. Retreat just long enough to alleviate the tension, take a few deep breaths and try again. Don't let anyone else steal your thunder."
pisces,2015-08-13,"The atmosphere is crackling with excitement and your life is buzzing with surprises; however, you might not be so amused with the current uncertainty. You have had your share of unexpected detours lately, and you're not looking for any more delays now. Luckily, your resiliency empowers you to improve your plan and achieve a successful launch. Be daring in your thinking and persistent in your execution. Practice makes perfect."
aries,2015-08-14,"You can't help but express what's in your heart today, but it's crucial to also make time to bask in the appreciation of your peers. Today's outgoing Leo New Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Games is your ticket to the party, especially if you already have something special on your calendar. You know the best way to turn work into play and might try to bring others along on your little joyride. However, you don't have to lead the parade if you secretly prefer to march to your own drummer; in fact, everyone admires you most when you remain true to yourself."
taurus,2015-08-14,"You may be quite content tending your garden or beautifying your living space while the Leo New Moon activates your 4th House of Roots. Nevertheless, you're longing for something more in your life and have one eye on the distant horizon. Happily, your common sense reigns supreme, reminding you of the importance of what's currently on your plate. Put away your suitcase; you don't need to chase a dream to the other side of the world now when the sweetest experiences are close to home."
gemini,2015-08-14,"You have so much to do today with the Leo New Moon stimulating your 3rd House of Immediate Environment that you don't know where to begin. But there's no reason to make a fuss about your accomplishments at work, even if you're hoping  others will stand up and take notice. Your coworkers could actually impede your progress by placing demands on your time if you draw unnecessary attention to yourself. Fortunately, you can outsmart reality and lay low for a bit so you can focus on moving forward with your plans instead of being distracted by everyone else's expectations."
cancer,2015-08-14,"You can prevent a problem before it even happens by taking strategic action right away. The Leo New Moon aligns with valuable Venus in your 2nd House of Money today, emphasizing the importance of how you handle a financial matter. If you miss your window of opportunity, a manageable situation might grow out of hand and lead to more complications than solutions. Luckily, an unexpected windfall could sweeten your life and bring much-needed relief if you don't fritter away your resources. Capitalize on your current abundance by saving for a rainy day."
leo,2015-08-14,"There's no need to wait for something exciting to happen because the New Moon in your sign is a harbinger of important changes that are already beginning to manifest in your life. Nevertheless, it's still advantageous to add new activities to your schedule that bring out the best in you. But don't do too much too fast since turning your life inside out isn't necessary. Proceeding deliberately is advised as long as you start the ball rolling today, while the energy still feels fresh."
virgo,2015-08-14,"You may be brimming with creativity today, but it's wise to let your ideas marinate in your imagination as long as you can. Although chatty Mercury is in your sign now, the Leo New Moon falls in your 12th House of Invisibility, making you hesitant to talk about your plans. You might be secretly afraid no one will care about your opinion, but your brilliance shines through anyhow. Don't waste your energy trying to hide your light; paradoxically, the more you shine, the brighter your light."
libra,2015-08-14,"Finding middle ground is tricky today as you weigh your sweetest dreams against your more practical concerns. It might even feel as if you can't miss your mark while the Leo New Moon highlights your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. It's nearly impossible to say no to an attractive offer with charming Venus in the picture. However free you might be in your mind, you also must address your mundane responsibilities. Thankfully, meeting your obligations allows you to entertain your colorful visions of the future without falling back into a rut of safety."
scorpio,2015-08-14,"Everyone can see your commitment to your career and how passionate you are about achieving success as the proud Leo New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Public Life. Luckily, you don't have to do anything differently now; your natural determination and unrelenting work ethic will impress your peers the most. Nevertheless, you may still be uncertain about your next move although you have specific objectives in mind. Concentrate on your destination now without worrying about the details; what you set in motion today sets the tone for the next couple of weeks."
sagittarius,2015-08-14,"Your dreams of escaping the boring routine of daily life run amok as the bold Leo New Moon empowers your 9th House of Faraway Places. Naturally, you're no stranger to these adventurous fantasies but a quick weekend getaway won't be enough to satiate your globetrotting desires. Fortunately, you don't have to be frustrated by your inability to cut ties completely. Aim your thoughts high and visualize the journey of a lifetime. In your mind you are free to go anywhere, and you never know what might come true in the future."
capricorn,2015-08-14,"A stressful relationship issue might require your immediate attention, but there's no reason to fret if you're willing to show up and do your part. In fact, the expressive Leo New Moon's presence in your 8th House of Regeneration offers you a sweet opportunity to morph a difficult situation into a magical one. You can set things right by re-framing the entire dynamic into one of potential growth, but you must explore emotionally charged issues in the process. Altering your perspective not only reduces your resistance today, it also has the possibility to transform your life."
aquarius,2015-08-14,"Fresh currents of cosmic energy could quickly reinvigorate a stagnant relationship now or even heat up a new one as the big-hearted Leo New Moon inspires your 7th House of Partners. However, you won't be satisfied with a quick fix because you are motivated to redefine your life to increase your sense of freedom. Go ahead and reach for the impossible because it might actually be attainable at this time. Take your best shot, but don't be too self-judgmental if you miss your mark. If you don't at first succeed, try, try again."
pisces,2015-08-14,"Simply showing up with a smile to do your chores might be half the battle today while the Leo New Moon occurs in your 6th House of Routine. You might wish you could pull up the covers and sleep in, but it's a much better strategy to jump out of bed and demonstrate what you are capable of accomplishing now. Paradoxically, grabbing the spotlight won't gain you the recognition you seek. Happily, working quietly on the sidelines improves your status because those who matter will appreciate your contribution and positive attitude."
aries,2015-08-15,"Summertime fun and games will have to wait until you have finished your chores, even if you're sorely tempted to set your responsibilities aside today. Although a happy-go-lucky Sun-Venus conjunction sparkles and shines in your 5th House of Spontaneity, stern Saturn's dominating presence won't take no for an answer. You know the drill: do whatever is required first and then you'll be able to chase pleasurable pursuits to your heart's content."
taurus,2015-08-15,"You are happy to spend time with your friends and family members today as your key planet Venus receives an illuminating kiss from the Sun in your 4th House of Emotional Security. But relaxing with loved ones isn't enough; you long for conversations about subjects of importance. Whether you're discussing what can be done about climate change or your plans for the future, there's no time to waste; you want to get to the heart of the matter. Just remember, you can't solve all the problems of the world but you can make a world of difference at home."
gemini,2015-08-15,"You are ready to make a deep and soulful connection with someone you love and are not searching for a lighthearted distraction now. Your key planet Mercury trines passionate Pluto, demanding that you follow your thoughts into the mysterious shadows of your subconscious. Your willingness to bring secrets out into the open can intensify a relationship and infuse your life with meaning. Sometimes you have to dig deep to find the treasure you seek."
cancer,2015-08-15,"It's hard to hide your inner beauty today. Even if you're not feeling overly optimistic, your profound appreciation of what someone else has to offer is, in itself, a gift. There's no reason to go overboard with flowery words or magnanimous gestures. Your caring way of embracing the moment communicates your support of others better than all the long-winded speeches or emails ever could. Just shoot straight from your heart and you cannot miss."
leo,2015-08-15,"The world is smiling upon you now while the brilliant Sun dances with loving Venus in your dramatic sign. Even with skeptical Pluto reminding you of all the logistical complexities, it's apparent that things are looking up. Don't try to avoid the process of transformation you have already begun. Luckily, there's no need to force anything; a magical process of growth is underway and all you need to do is let the transition unfold organically without any resistance on your part."
virgo,2015-08-15,"It's your job to find ways to escape from the real world and indulge your fantasies today. Something as simple as watching a movie or dancing the night away could be sufficient to activate your imagination. But whatever you choose to do, balance your need to kick up your heels and have a good time with your desire to retreat and explore the inner landscape of your mind. It's one thing to stimulate your senses, yet your soul must also be a part of the picture if you want to feel spiritually fulfilled."
libra,2015-08-15,"You're all dressed up with nowhere to go. You are not particularly interested in being alone now that your key planet Venus is cast in the spotlight by the radiant Sun in your social 11th House. However, you still might feel that your motives are misunderstood, even when you're the life of the party. Remember, there's no reason to play games. Your heart is more transparent than you realize today, so allow your true self to shine through and let the cards fall where they may."
scorpio,2015-08-15,"You're fully capable of putting on a big smile today and dancing your way through the required show and tell. Everyone loves you, even if you don't reveal your true feelings. Seeing through the thin social veneer is a mixed blessing if you don't want others to know what's really happening within your heart. You won't be easily fooled, yet you might not like what you learn. Keep your cool, since there is more to lose and nothing to gain now by upsetting the status quo."
sagittarius,2015-08-15,"You have much to be grateful for today and you're feeling so optimistic that you are ready to commit to something big. But even if everything appears to be on the up and up, it's prudent now to wait a few more days before jumping in wholeheartedly. It's not that anything in particular is wrong; it's just that your enthusiasm is so great now that you could miss an important detail. Embrace the moment without rushing the future."
capricorn,2015-08-15,"You may feel a bit disjointed today while there's so much hustle and bustle happening all around you. The good news is it looks like fun; however, you're hesitant to join in because you may be afraid of losing control. Don't worry so much about making everything work perfectly, since you are possibly the harshest judge around. Enjoy the cosmic ride; easing off on the reins slightly could prove to be a brilliant move on your part."
aquarius,2015-08-15,"There are so many overly cheerful people around you today that they might grate on your nerves. Unfortunately, there isn't any place to hide. Someone may talk your ear off obsessively about a political cause that you're only interested in peripherally, giving you more information than you need to know. Instead of bluntly telling others to quiet down or go away, be as tactful as you can in handling the situation. Being diplomatic now prevents relationship headaches later on."
pisces,2015-08-15,"You might undervalue your actions today, but people are watching what you do and listening to what you say more than you know. Your presentation can be crucial, but it will quickly be irrelevant unless you have real substance to back it up. Take all the time you need to finish your current tasks with the kind of workmanship that makes you proud of your accomplishments. Ultimately, your productivity will speak louder than anything else."
aries,2015-08-16,"You're intent on doing an excellent job on whatever projects you choose to tackle today. Your current willingness to put in the extra time inspires others to appreciate you even more. You may be motivated on your own, but being noticed certainly doesn't hurt. Just don't let the compliments swell your head; hard work all but ensures your success as long as you don't expect more than you deserve."
taurus,2015-08-16,"Someone may be pulling strings behind the curtains, possibly manipulating you to change your current direction. However, you're inclined to push back if you feel coerced. Your obstinacy could stand in the way of learning whatever it is you need to know at this time, especially if you try to overwhelm others with your perspective before they are able to say anything at all. Stay open to the facts even if they're not what you want to hear now. The truth can set you free."
gemini,2015-08-16,"You might actually believe you could earn a gold medal in mental gymnastics, but each clever thought you add to a conversation today is ignored as if you don't even exist. You may start to feel invisible because your ideas don't seem capable of gaining traction. It's no fun if you can't make yourself understood, but don't let your frustration define your day. Instead, recognize that you're just a bit off in your delivery now. Thankfully, this communication quagmire won't last; you can play to a more willing audience tomorrow."
cancer,2015-08-16,"It's essential to say exactly what you mean today or a miscommunication can suddenly turn a seemingly unimportant comment into a major meltdown. Open conflict serves no purpose now, since you're already cognizant of the current differences of opinion. There may not be an obvious resolution because arguments might miss the point entirely. Think about the impact of your words before you say anything at all. A well-crafted message will produce your desired results."
leo,2015-08-16,"You need to rely on your inner resources today rather than basing your feelings on acquiring new possessions. Unfortunately, if you're suffering from a bout of low self-esteem, you probably won't think you are deserving of something special now, anyway. Nevertheless, you're likely being harder on yourself than needed. Stay aware of any lingering negativity while delaying a purchase decision until tomorrow when your approach will be fair and balanced. No amount of money will make you happy if you're not happy with yourself."
virgo,2015-08-16,"Your moods are shifting with irregularity now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. It feels as if you're riding a see-saw today; you're quite confident one moment and feeling shaky the next. Instead of taking time to acknowledge the positive side of a situation, you could be swept downward in a self-judgmental spiral. Luckily, you have the power to change your direction and to propel yourself to the top of your game. Make an empowering decision and stick with it, no matter what happens along the way."
libra,2015-08-16,"It's as if clouds have descended over your imagination, making it an uphill battle to share your thoughts today. Unfortunately, you might not be able to latch onto a positive vision to lift yourself out of your malaise. Thankfully, someone special may suddenly come along and inspire you, catalyzing the change you need. Your disappointment could dissipate quickly if you're open enough to accept well-intended assistance when it's offered. The right decision can make your dreams come true."
scorpio,2015-08-16,"You might choose to participate in a group event with social acquaintances or neighbors today, even if you don't have much in common with those involved. Maybe you're driven by the potential connections you could make, rather than deepening any one relationship. Give yourself permission to engage without having to justify your decision, especially since the pros likely outweigh the cons, anyway."
sagittarius,2015-08-16,"You may attempt to adhere to your established schedule so you can set a good example for others to follow today. But keeping everyone else in line is tricky when you're feeling so antsy yourself. Fortunately, you should be able to balance your current responsibilities with the incoming waves of restlessness if you keep track of your priorities. Focusing your intentions in the present moment is easier if you remember the long-term payoff will bring lasting satisfaction in the end."
capricorn,2015-08-16,"You're fantasizing about a familiar escape now that the Moon is brightening your 9th House of Travel. Unfortunately, you can't focus on the necessary planning for your dream vacation now, especially if you believe it's just an unrealistic flight of your imagination. Stop worrying about the practicalities of your big ideas. Sometimes it's more important to dream than anything else. Failing to reach your objective may be disappointing, but having no goals at all can be tragic."
aquarius,2015-08-16,"You might have revealed your opinion too quickly about an important issue, and now you're unable to take back your words. A disagreement with your partner today can suddenly turn the sweetest relationship into a temporary battlefield. Your good intentions aren't enough; you also must remain vigilant or everything could quickly grow nasty. Take complete responsibility for your current role in the sketchy dynamics to get the process moving in the right direction once again."
pisces,2015-08-16,"Improving your financial situation may be one of your top concerns now. However, it's crucial to concentrate on creating common ground with someone else, rather than blazing your own trail to wealth. The reflective Moon highlights your 7th House of Partners, helping to stabilize a relationship today as long as you're willing to remain honest about your needs. Things might not change as quickly as you wish. Paradoxically, taking a less aggressive approach to making money is the fastest way to reduce the pressure."
aries,2015-08-17,"It's stressful trying to determine how much to reveal when discussing your current predicament at work. It helps if you have a concrete plan in mind, but you are likely to misjudge the size of the task anyhow. From a practical standpoint, you don't have sufficient time to go back and start over. Instead, keep inching your way forward and do the best you can to cross things off your list. The more you take care of today, the easier your workload will be tomorrow."
taurus,2015-08-17,"You might have assumed that a minimal amount of effort would be enough to accomplish your goals today; however, you quickly realize that it's going to take a lot more work than you expected. Luckily, you don't discourage easily when it comes to matters of importance. If unforeseen difficulties slow you down now, just continue to apply steady pressure to produce the outcome you desire. Some people succeed because they are destined, but most reach the top because they are determined."
gemini,2015-08-17,"It doesn't appear to matter how hard you push yourself today because you are dependent on events outside of your control. Ironically, your most successful strategy is to methodically slow down before someone or something else does it for you. Rather than frustrating yourself trying to overcome the current resistance head on, relax a bit. Let the circumstances dictate your progress now rather than focusing solely on your destination. Go with the flow for the best results."
cancer,2015-08-17,"A recent shift of plans might have been somewhat upsetting, even if it was absolutely necessary. Retrospectively, it's obvious that your response was totally valid. In fact, you continue to make positive changes as you gain new perspectives. It's not a sign of failure if you see something today that wasn't previously apparent. A current obstacle is merely a test to see if you are listening to the feedback the universe is giving you. Your mind is like a parachute; it works only when it's open."
leo,2015-08-17,"Your unflagging tenacity continues to accelerate your progress in life, but it's useful to stop for a moment to take stock of your past accomplishments. Set aside enough time to reassess your needs and then revise your plans so they reflect your current desires. Don't worry if satisfaction seems beyond your reach today. Do whatever is required now while holding onto the belief that the good times will soon return. Believe it or not, the best is yet to come."
virgo,2015-08-17,"Your eyes are on the horizon and you can't help but dream of the opportunities ahead while the Moon in your sign stirs the winds of dissatisfaction. But prior to making any drastic changes in your life, create a list of what is left to do before you can realistically move on. Finish up as much as possible today, even if your work isn't quite up to your exacting standards. You will feel more relaxed about your current situation as you continue to anticipate something extraordinary in your future."
libra,2015-08-17,"Your natural instinct to keep everyone happy could be challenged today, especially if you think you can change someone else's feelings. Ironically, the more you push for your idea of peace, the more you end up contributing to the tension. An awkward interaction with a coworker has all the makings of a losing battle now. However, exercising patience while letting go of control is your best strategy for an equitable solution. Lead by example and focus on your work."
scorpio,2015-08-17,"You may be feeling uneasy about a subject you don't wish to discuss now, even if you know you should speak up. Nevertheless, you might still attempt to circumnavigate a conversation that could complicate a close relationship. Thankfully, you are able to push past your resistance because you intuitively know that temporarily making a situation worse can ultimately transform a delicate situation into a happy one. A calculated risk could clear the air of secrecy that's been lingering around for too long."
sagittarius,2015-08-17,"You might have to manage an unexpected crisis with a close friend or relative today, even if your life appears to be running smoothly on the outside. People with the best of intentions may not have a clue that you're upset and the more others say or do now, the worse you feel. However, there's no reason to prevent anyone's self-expression, since that will only raise the frustration level even higher. You don't have to act like everything is sunshine and roses all the time; sharing your concerns makes the weight of the world easier for your shoulders to bear."
capricorn,2015-08-17,"You're a champ when it comes to sensible planning and time management. Your unwavering discipline enables you to work long hours to reach your goals. Often, you remember to reserve energy for when you need it, but something is driving you from within now and tempting you to burn all your fuel at once. Nevertheless, throwing caution to the wind is not a good idea since you won't get what you want any faster. Retain some resources to sustain your momentum for the final push down the road."
aquarius,2015-08-17,"You might try to slog your way through an obstacle course at work, but you will continue to face the consequences of past foolish actions until you get it right. This is not the best time to explore an unproven shortcut or try any clever maneuvers. Simply apply yourself in a consistent manner, even if you don't seem to be making a lot of progress today. Don't panic; you're accomplishing more than you think and your valuable contribution will garner the respect you deserve."
pisces,2015-08-17,"There are no quick escape routes for you today, so don't waste your time and energy attempting to avoid your work. Nevertheless, taking a few steps back is a smart move because it allows someone else to hold the reins of control for a while. Sharing the heavy burden of leadership lightens your sense of responsibility and can bring you a taste of the freedom you crave. The current changes may not be huge, but even a small, sensible shift positively affects your attitude and improves your productivity."
aries,2015-08-18,"You don't know whether you should be feeling happy or sad today. You thrive when things are popping, but the stress level may be a bit much even for you hot-to-trot Aries. However, you don't want to let up on the gas now as you drive for power and success. Although people seem to thwart your efforts, you could inadvertently be the one blocking your own progress. You can be overbearing when you're certain about your destination, but your intensity might be too much for others to handle. A lighter touch on your part gives everyone the room to choose their own level of participation."
taurus,2015-08-18,"It may be impossible to settle complex interpersonal dynamics at work today. You might think you're being objective in your assessment of the current situation, but your compulsive desires could be mixed up with other people's feelings. Your attempts to sort out everyone's conflicting needs only make matters more complicated now. Be patient; solving the dilemma will take time as well as persistence. In the meantime, be kind to all parties involved, including yourself."
gemini,2015-08-18,"Although your agenda might clash with someone else's today, you're able to react fast enough to turn a potential conflict into a non-event. Although others might try to rein you in, you could outsmart them with your inclusive attitude. Somehow, you seem to take their resistance in stride without succumbing to their negativity. Much to everyone's surprise, your skillful diplomacy could raise the bar and deftly transform an enemy into a friend."
cancer,2015-08-18,"Your peers are pressuring you to actively contribute to their projects today, even if you already have your work cut out for you. However, rather than buckling under the demands of the moment, you might ignore the wishes of others now. You're not willing to retreat from your position, even if someone offers you a graceful exit strategy. Nevertheless, you won't likely alienate yourself from your associates if you simply take the time to acknowledge the importance of their efforts, too."
leo,2015-08-18,"Your willingness to see things from a different perspective reveals a new twist in the direction a relationship takes now. Although you might have engaged in a conversation for the sheer enjoyment of the moment, your playful feelings deepen as you're pushed to explore the dark corners of your own psyche. Don't brush this special opportunity off as something trivial, for sharing your heart will be more difficult tomorrow if nothing is said today."
virgo,2015-08-18,"Your cool approach to an emotional conversation is unsustainable today. In fact, the more you try to withhold an unpleasant feeling, the stronger it grows and the longer it will persist. Coming right out and saying what you might normally keep to yourself is your most reliable strategy, because communication flows once you get your issues off your chest. Your willingness to engage in an intense dialogue can push a relationship to a new level of intimacy. Nothing is off limits if you approach the subject with humility and kindness."
libra,2015-08-18,"You are bewildered by your constantly changing needs and fluctuating desires while several planets stress the evocative Moon in your sign today. It's nearly impossible to make plans and stick with them because your feelings transform from moment to moment as circumstances shift. Thankfully, you can easily keep your head above water if you strive for the widest possible perspective. Open your mind and not your mouth as you navigate your way through the sea of your emotions."
scorpio,2015-08-18,"You may believe you're heading down a path to an inevitable destination, but your decisive action today can put a positive spin on your future. You might feel closed down as if you are in survival mode, but you could be focusing on the wrong things. Instead of getting caught up in the stress of the moment, think about the actions you can take today that will have a profound impact on tomorrow. Instead of allowing yourself to slip into a place of jealousy or fear, seize this cosmic opportunity to improve your game and run with it."
sagittarius,2015-08-18,"Your future is beckoning, but you're also painfully aware of a lingering issue that could stand in your way of success. Just when you think everything is copacetic, an up-welling of powerful emotions demands your undivided attention. Don't think for a moment that you can stuff them back into the basement of your unconscious mind. Opportunity often arrives shrouded in uncertainty. The amazing potential ahead will only multiply if you have the courage to face the unknown."
capricorn,2015-08-18,"Putting your finger on the center of the storm is one of your strategic ways of regaining control of a dynamic situation. Nevertheless, you can feel that something big is heading your direction and you might overreact by trying to fix everyone else's issues now while making light of your own. Unfortunately, this misguided strategy won't make your sailing any smoother. Instead, redirect your attention inward; transformation comes from within."
aquarius,2015-08-18,"You can feel the easy breezes of the airy Libra Moon, yet you can't avoid more serious issues  currently on your plate. You may be dreaming about wonderful possibilities that stretch out before you, but it might take more time to get there than you wish. Nevertheless, living in the future doesn't solve anything today, so gently bring yourself back to reality. The sooner you face the music, the sooner you can dance your dreams into existence."
pisces,2015-08-18,"You might not be in the mood to share your toys with others today, leading to a struggle over the control of important resources. On a very basic level, a disagreement over a joint checking account can instigate an unpleasant encounter. However, the conflict may be more complex as you renegotiate a business partnership or debate about the ownership of an idea. Nevertheless, it is not in your best interest to become greedy or possessive. Fair play is the best insurance for everyone to come out a winner."
aries,2015-08-19,"Nearly anything goes today while the urgency of your feelings pushes you closer to a breaking point. You might believe that unnecessary rules of etiquette are restraining your desires, making you feel more impulsive about expressing what you want. Experimenting with new dance steps is exhilarating as long as you don't completely ignore the rhythm of the music. Step outside of the box now, but make sure you can find your way back home. A touch of moderation ultimately saves you from yourself."
taurus,2015-08-19,"You Bulls have a long-standing reputation of being overly stubborn once you have made up your minds. Fortunately, you can prove everyone wrong now by demonstrating how flexible and innovative you can be as your key planet Venus flirts with unpredictable Uranus. You have a twinkle of anticipation in your eye and can't help but smile as you wait for something wonderful to happen. Even if you rely on your common sense, you're primed for fun and adventure. Don't let others limit your individual expression; bring a playful attitude to all that you do. Spontaneity is your ticket to happiness."
gemini,2015-08-19,"You can change your mind about your likes and dislikes faster than any other sign because you tend to be less fixed in your preferences. You're naturally attracted to new experiences and this curiosity is magnified now as you are eager to try almost anything if it appears to be a worthy distraction. Although your heightened sense of reckless abandon suggests the need to be on high alert, it can also lead to delightful social interactions if you're willing to take a risk. The philosopher Camus wrote, ""Always go too far because that's where you'll find the truth."""
cancer,2015-08-19,"In your own quiet way, you are desperately seeking the lightning now. You're tired of the same-old routine and there's an irrepressible streak within you that is ready to strike. Even if this means doing something out of the ordinary, you'll still take your actions quite seriously. On one hand, the cosmically charged atmosphere is ripe for an unconventional romance. On the other hand, you have a strong inner voice cautioning you against doing anything you might regret later. Sometimes the consequences are worth it when you're following your bliss."
leo,2015-08-19,"You can feel the electricity in the air -- the kind that makes your hairs stand on end. Thankfully, it's not fear that you are experiencing now; rather, it's the anticipation of what might come next. Unorthodox Uranus is harmonizing with sweet Venus in your sign, amplifying your attraction to life on the edge. Don't be your own greatest obstacle to happiness. Even if you go further than you expected, you'll be back soon enough with a memorable tale to tell. You only live once."
virgo,2015-08-19,"Letting go is often challenging because your practical side usually gives you an anchor to tether you to solid ground. Additionally, you well-prepared Virgos usually have a backup plan in case your original one should fail. However, you might benefit from temporarily cutting yourself free now and feeling the exhilaration of zero gravity. Your common sense will reappear just in time to save you from drifting off into deep space."
libra,2015-08-19,"What would it be like if you could forget about all your responsibilities and take out all your favorite toys, instead? You might not have the luxury of running out on your obligations, but you can make time for creative play today, even if it's not what others expect from you. Indulge your own unique self-expression, whether you use a musical instrument, crayons, a camera or your computer. A wild and crazy part of you has been itching to be heard and now is your chance to make it happen. Shine, baby, shine!"
scorpio,2015-08-19,"Your desire to express your individuality today is in direct conflict with your need for emotional or financial security. Fortunately, the potential for healing is great now, but it may require extra effort on your part to move past your own fear of change. There is a narrow window of opportunity as your anticipation of a breakthrough is greater than your hesitancy. Push on through to the other side while the cosmic vibes are giving you the perfect opportunity to evolve."
sagittarius,2015-08-19,"The stress in your relationships eases today if you have the confidence to bring out your own bag of tricks. However, these are not sleight-of-hand manipulations of a stage magician. Rather, they are the psychological tools and interpersonal communication skills that you have honed over the years. Nevertheless, just like a modern-day wizard, it's up to you to produce fun diversions  from the more serious issues of life. Creating a buzz while you can is just a catalyst for the much-needed changes yet to come."
capricorn,2015-08-19,"Your inner host or hostess springs to life today as you strive to add some excitement into the lives of your friends and associates. It's obvious where the energy has grown stagnant and you know how to generate a few well-formed waves for others to ride. Thankfully, your brilliant actions shake up the dynamics and wake the sleeping potential of the moment. You derive a special kind of satisfaction when you use your powers of influence for the good of all."
aquarius,2015-08-19,"Paradoxically, there's just the right amount of craziness in your daily life to make you feel sane. A recent lull has you craving an adrenaline rush and you're ready for some action to spice up your boring routine. The lightning is striking and the brilliant flash allows you to clearly see your ideal future. Satisfaction is within reach today if you have the courage to make your move, especially when it comes to relationships. There's no better moment than the present to follow your heart."
pisces,2015-08-19,"The creature comforts and emotional security you normally need are temporarily put on the back burner today. Instead of playing it safe, you have a cosmic permission slip to be outrageous now and to explore things that you would normally pass by. However, this is not a permanent change of attitude, just a momentary shift in the force. Experiment and have some fun. Dance like no one is watching just because you can."
aries,2015-08-20,"There is an obvious conflict between your long-term relationship goals and your present responsibilities. Even if you can visualize a clear path to your ideal future, initiating action may need to be delayed for a while longer. Create a new schedule for the day that empowers you to make the best of the current situation while you're still working out the logistics that involve someone else. Get out of your head and into your heart."
taurus,2015-08-20,"The noise level of your personal drama might be a bit too much for your normally refined tastes. Although you have a low tolerance for tension, you aren't anxious with the current circumstances. You fully realize the potential of this moment won't last, empowering you to discuss your concerns and stick with the conversation. Others will be disappointed if you simply try to satisfy their expectations without pursuing your heart's desires, too. Make sure that your actions are aligned with your feelings and your mind is open to change."
gemini,2015-08-20,"You might feel as if you're bogged down in quicksand today, and the more you try to solve a relationship issue the deeper you sink. You might even succumb to a moment of panic as you unsuccessfully struggle to extract yourself from a delicate situation. Having all the right words at your disposal won't help you now. Instead of attempting to impress others, seek comfort within. Settling into your feelings enables you to sort out what your heart really wants."
cancer,2015-08-20,"Unreasonable demands are stretching your personal resources to the max. Even if you experience resentment rising into awareness, there's no direct way to express your annoyance today. Unfortunately, people may continue to judge you as overly negative if you try to share your frustration. Your best strategy now is to throw yourself into your work and get as much done as possible. The simplest adjustment of your attitude makes a world of difference to your productivity."
leo,2015-08-20,"You have highly specific ideas about how to perform your chores today and you aren't interested in debating the merits of your choices. Unfortunately, no one will be a winner in a conflict if push comes to shove, even if you really do know what's best for everyone involved. Sharing your perspective isn't enough now; avoid an escalation of emotions by practicing the art of compromise. Acting with a spirit of generosity leads to the most harmonious outcome."
virgo,2015-08-20,"Your mental acuity can be so sharp now that you don't leave very much room for negotiation. Undoubtedly, you are a formidable opponent because your perceptions are irrefutable today. Nevertheless, being correct in your conclusions doesn't give you permission to ignore the opinions of everyone else. Soliciting alternative points of view shows your willingness to cooperate prior to finalizing your plans. The added advantage of this inclusive strategy is you might just learn how to build a better mousetrap in the process."
libra,2015-08-20,"Your full participation in a discussion with close friends or family members is absolutely mandatory today, so there's no valid excuse to avoid a messy confrontation. Although you have your own biases, you're still capable of rationalizing any point of view. This detached approach enables the disagreeing parties to trust you as an objective and non-threatening mediator. Do whatever you can to be of assistance, but be cognizant that you might not be able to fix the problem now. It's not your fault; the final solution may have to wait until everyone else settles down."
scorpio,2015-08-20,"Your intuition is on fire today, but you must be cautious when applying the insight you receive in such a cosmic manner. Unfortunately, you have the power to upset the stability of the group dynamics, making your life more complicated in the process. Your best bet now is to work cooperatively as part of a team and not strike out on your own. Following a hunch is a better idea after you have verified the facts with someone you trust. It never hurts to get a second opinion when it comes to matters of the heart."
sagittarius,2015-08-20,"You're ready to challenge any authority figure that stands in your way today because you know you're right and are willing to go the extra mile to inspire others. Thankfully, it's less work convincing people to join your cause while your words carry the intensity of the moment. Still, caution is advised since it's a whole lot easier to get in over your head than it is to pull back and retreat to higher ground. Be crystal clear about your objectives before you take the next step; it's better to be safe than sorry."
capricorn,2015-08-20,"You might be concerned that your current long-term goals aren't practical enough to present you in the best light. Nevertheless, your perspective is probably warped by old fears more than anything else. Uranus is annoying communicator Mercury, stirring up trouble everywhere you go. There's no need to panic and impulsively take a risk because chances are nothing is as dramatic as it seems. Find your center; leading with your calm determination improves the likelihood of reaching your destination."
aquarius,2015-08-20,"Step right up to the plate and start swinging for the fences; it's time to show everyone what you can do when you put your mind to it. Friends and coworkers are depending on you and you certainly don't want to let them down. Setting a positive example for others to follow is the best way to demonstrate your altruistic intentions. Fortunately, hitting a home run surpasses everyone's expectations, enabling you to come through like a real champion."
pisces,2015-08-20,"You want to join in the good times today, but might find it quite challenging to let go of your agenda in order to interact socially. It's difficult to participate because you may feel restrained by the very same people you want to engage. It's healthy to discuss your concerns, but don't dwell on the differences for too long. Ultimately, connecting with others is a whole lot more fun now than isolating yourself from the party. When it comes to your current enjoyment, the more the merrier."
aries,2015-08-21,"There are more choices than you see at first glance as you encounter an unexpected roadblock on your path. Naturally, you can run directly into the trouble, attempting to power your way through it. The good news is you appear like a superhero if this impulsive tactic works. But a headstrong attack could be foolhardy today and only lead to greater frustration. Other options manifest once you stop to understand the lessons of the current situation. Luckily, everything can magically fall into place when you finally recognize the truth that you're the only thing standing in your way."
taurus,2015-08-21,"Emotions that rise to the surface now are doing so for a good reason although the logic may not be apparent to you right away. You are wise to wait a bit longer before making any significant decisions that involve others because current relationship dynamics are still in flux. Instead of focusing on any delays or setbacks today, remember that expressing your feelings invokes the magical power to change everything in the twinkling of an eye. An honest conversation about your concerns just might lead to the brilliant solution you seek."
gemini,2015-08-21,"Although your current workload might seem overwhelming, nearly anything is possible once you set a goal and put your mind to it. Paradoxically, the unresolved feelings that may be holding you back also contain the seeds for your next growth spurt. If a coworker seems to be a part of the problem, it's time to address the issue. This is no time to walk away in defeat, even if your confidence is flagging. Today's discussions set the stage for tomorrow's transformations."
cancer,2015-08-21,"You may believe someone is being too critical of your work style while Saturn the Taskmaster is raining on your parade. Nevertheless, you have a rare opportunity to express your creativity with more clarity now. It's crucial to remain optimistic about your options because facing a challenge or a delay doesn't mean you should give up. Instead, stabilize your position by strengthening your plans and making adjustments as you go along. Ultimately, others can't rattle your cage if you believe in yourself."
leo,2015-08-21,"You are being tested today, and how you respond to the current emotional pressure has direct consequences in the future. However, complicated relationship dynamics or demanding work schedules are merely temporary detours. Be careful, if you're moving too fast, an unexpected speed bump might cause serious damage. Luckily, most trouble can be averted if you see the obstacles in advance. Take your cues from the ongoing feedback that reality offers and plan your course accordingly. Observing the rules of the road increases your chances for success."
virgo,2015-08-21,"Although you are tempted to throw caution to the wind now, a friend will have enough sense to remind you about your priorities. In the long run, it's insignificant if some things aren't going exactly as you wish because you can make choices today that keep you on your chosen path. Practicing flexibility is currently more important than striving for sustainability. If you can conjure up an image of your goal in your mind's eye, it has a solid chance of becoming real. Having unwavering faith in your decisions is the first step to reaching your goals."
libra,2015-08-21,"All of the observable signs seem to indicate you're on the right track. Nevertheless, you are still facing conflict because others seem to have different expectations for your life. Or, perhaps, friends are causing you stress by acting recklessly instead of fulfilling their responsibilities. No matter what dilemmas you face now, keeping your eyes on the prize while rolling with the changes will help see you through the present turmoil. Putting your life in proper perspective is easier when your sense of humor is close at hand."
scorpio,2015-08-21,"Your mind continues to probe for the truth today, but you might feel thwarted by reality every which way you turn. Thankfully, your thinking process is grounded while your instincts encourage you to develop your vision of an ideal future. However, your basic material needs and sensual desires may be the source of drama. First, you must make some adjustments as your goals transform along with the current circumstances. It isn't the right time to change everything all at once, but fine-tuning your daily routine is certainly in order if you want to take your life to the next level."
sagittarius,2015-08-21,"Success is in the air but it doesn't come without its own share of complications today. Although you may not be able to eliminate all the chaos, you're tempted to step around a potential problem to get to the good stuff. Unfortunately, taking a less confrontational route won't necessarily save time or expenses in the long run. Any issue that surfaces now is here for a reason; you can move on at a faster pace once you learn this valuable lesson the universe is trying to teach you."
capricorn,2015-08-21,"Your nemesis may appear in the form of a contradictory idea, a strong-willed person or an immovable set of circumstances. In any event, you're up for the challenge today. Still, you must examine your own weaknesses first while the willful Sun squares your key planet Saturn. Nevertheless, judging yourself too harshly does more harm than good, especially if someone else is criticizing your efforts, too. Dwelling on your shortcomings doesn't help the situation. Get busy; you are a work in progress with no time to waste."
aquarius,2015-08-21,"Paradoxically, the quicker you accept your current limitations, the faster you can break free from the restraints. Your current lesson is about working within the rules, rather than fighting against the inevitable. There are times to push the edges of the envelope, and there are times to exercise self-control to maintain the status quo. Instead of trying to decide which approach to take, just commit to being real. With a little bit of luck, the insurmountable problems you face today will seem a whole lot less complicated tomorrow."
pisces,2015-08-21,"You love swimming in open waters where there are no boundaries in sight. But today you run into walls that prevent you from reaching the finish line. Instead of worrying about the distance between you and your goals, step back and refocus on your most pressing responsibilities. Once you have reshuffled your priorities to match your life, it will be easier to work within the defined limits of the game."
aries,2015-08-22,"Although your day begins with high expectations, a series of unsettling events can hijack your agenda and diminish your productivity. Fortunately, you're able to prevent a downward spiral by concentrating on fulfilling your obligations rather than getting entangled in dramas that don't directly concern you. Surprisingly, you don't have to fix everything that seems to go wrong. Problems should being to resolve once the Moon enters lighthearted Sagittarius later in the day and everyone starts to take themselves a little less seriously."
taurus,2015-08-22,"Yesterday's annoying interference from others feels more like well-intentioned help today. However, a confrontation may be necessary to turn an adversary into an ally who is willing to stand up on your behalf. Be honest to a fault now; complications will only resurface if your long-term goals aren't compatible. Taking the necessary time to compare notes about your individual destinations keeps you on the same page, preventing anyone from experiencing disappointment down the road. Clear communication leads to shared success."
gemini,2015-08-22,"There are so many details to track that you must remain on your toes and do your best to keep your eye on the ball. Unfortunately, a restrictive Moon-Saturn conjunction suppresses your desire to juggle so many seemingly insignificant things today. However, your lack of attention to the minutiae makes them all the more important if your overall plan begins to unravel. Taking a shortcut could be costly, leaving you even further away from your goal. A quick reassessment of your strengths and weaknesses will get you back in the game, stronger than ever."
cancer,2015-08-22,"Attempting to draw a definitive line between the objective facts and your subjective feelings can be a challenging task today. Fuzzy Neptune casts a magic spell on you now that tricks you into believing the opposite of what's going on. Fortunately, your confusion dissipates when you recognize the temporarily imbalanced relationship between your head and your heart. Paradoxically, peace of mind is yours once you accept things the way they are."
leo,2015-08-22,"Although you have a specific goal in mind, the route to satisfaction appears to be shrouded in fog. You might feel compelled to float in your own uncertainty today until you realize that it's best to let go of your previous assumptions. But just when you're ready to loosen the reins, the clouds of illusion return to diminish your visibility and increase your self-doubt. Don't lose hope when you have come so far; the Moon's shift into optimistic Sagittarius gives you the courage to move forward with confidence."
virgo,2015-08-22,"You are more apt to make a snap decision based on your gut feelings today as the watery Moon swims in the deep end with authoritative Saturn. But fully acknowledging your emotions is nearly impossible while nebulous Neptune is lurking around the edges of your awareness, creating a trepidation of the unknown. Hunker down and wait for your clarity to reemerge before doing something you might regret. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
libra,2015-08-22,"You can easily convince yourself that nearly anything is true today, but you are wise enough not to share your experiences until later in the day. However, you may not know when to stop talking because your judgment isn't very sharp now. You're likely to get into more trouble for what you reveal than for what you leave unsaid. The less you say, the better. Wearing a mysterious smile creates space for you to indulge your fantasies."
scorpio,2015-08-22,"Relying on your imagination to make a big decision isn't the simplest path to follow. In fact, others may criticize your irrational approach and suggest you pay closer attention to the facts. However, you're in the serious process of reinventing yourself and have very little patience for anyone else's expectations. Even if you reconsider your current choice tomorrow, it's still wise to follow your heart today."
sagittarius,2015-08-22,"Handling unfinished business during the day allows you to ride the new cycle of events that begins when the Moon returns to your sign this afternoon. In the meantime, you must act responsibly by temporarily setting aside your dreams while you manage more practical matters. Don't be concerned if you're bored with the humdrum of your daily routine, since it won't last much longer. Practice patience; you will be free to fly soon enough."
capricorn,2015-08-22,"You love the idea of exploring your fantasies today, but you hate wasting all that time being unproductive. Unfortunately, you Goats often have such a strong connection with the mundane world that it's difficult to set it aside for a flight into your imagination. Nevertheless, you can cleverly employ a bit of word magic to justify guilt-free dream chasing. Rather than escaping, just call it ""strategic planning"" and put it on your calendar. Traveling into the realm of idealistic possibilities is extremely constructive if you remember that thought creates reality."
aquarius,2015-08-22,"You might not understand other people's actions today because they are on a different trajectory than you. They seem to be acting selfishly and don't appear to care about your feelings. Although you may be angry at first, compassionate Neptune is in the picture, reminding you that there is a higher path to follow. When you place yourself in someone else's shoes, you can see things from an entirely new perspective. Don't miss this chance to raise the vibration level by practicing forgiveness that comes from the heart, not just from the head."
pisces,2015-08-22,"You want to take control of your day by making a schedule and keeping everything on track. However, your key planet Neptune is playing games with macho Mars today, muddying your intentions and confusing those around you. Although your friends and family might encourage you to do more, you may end up scattering your energy if you listen to their advice. Jumping to conclusions won't work in your favor now; leave the bigger decisions for another day and honor your creative pursuits, instead."
aries,2015-08-23,"All the big ideas in the world aren't a viable substitute for one that actually works. However, the difference between a strategy that succeeds and one that fails might be in the execution rather than in the plan, itself. Following through on your promises is top priority while the conscientious Virgo Sun makes its month-long trek through your 6th House of Duty. Integrity counts; put your lofty dreams on a shelf for a while and attend to the things that matter most."
taurus,2015-08-23,"Your creativity is on the launch pad yet, oddly enough, your self-expression isn't just about you. You don't want to waste energy on touting your talents alone when everyone has a stake in the results. Instead, taking a more egalitarian approach includes other people in your process, especially if their artistic, political or philosophical beliefs support yours. Whether you're gardening, making music or programming the next killer app, your success depends on narrowing your focus and setting the right goals. In order to reach your destination, you must first know which direction you're heading and who wants to come along for the ride."
gemini,2015-08-23,"You may have your heart set on doing something fun with your friends today, only to change your plans at the very last minute. The Sun's shift into your 4th House of Emotional Security is a reminder that you can find plenty of ways to amuse yourself while staying at home. However, setting aside a chunk of time for some serious contemplation might be part of a deeper change of heart. Reconsidering your personal priorities and taking care of your own needs is good medicine for your soul."
cancer,2015-08-23,"You might believe that you can fit a lot more into your day if you carefully make a detailed schedule. Unfortunately, too much planning could backfire on you now if one little change early in the day causes the entire house of cards to tumble down. Nevertheless, you still could make the most of your day if you're willing to let some activities fall to the wayside. Your current happiness is not dependent on external events; it's more about how you respond to those things beyond your control. Flexibility is your friend."
leo,2015-08-23,"Although you can't escape your regular duties today, you can still find plenty of time to play. You might try to chase a dimming light, afraid you won't be able to reach it before it goes out. But the fun and games aren't over just because the radiant Sun has left your expressive sign for the more restrained realms of Virgo. Don't complain; you can't control the ebb and flow of the cosmic tides any more than you can control the vagaries of your heart. Remember, you're in it for the long haul; pacing yourself now enables you to sustain your energy for the challenges ahead."
virgo,2015-08-23,"These are the days you've been eagerly waiting for as the iridescent Sun embraces generous Jupiter in your sign, illuminating your 1st House of Self. Although you may be giddy with anticipation, it's tough to wrap your brain around the potential changes ahead. Nevertheless, you have a rare opportunity to expand your outlook on life through travel, education or even a relationship. Just be sure to assimilate the lessons in bite-sized amounts. Too much growth all at once will give you indigestion of the soul. You have more time than you think so soak in the knowledge and learn as much as you can."
libra,2015-08-23,"Taking a break from mundane responsibilities enables you to maximize the Sun's visit to your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Instead of initiating new projects, you're wise to tie up loose ends and schedule time for soul-searching rather than running off to find the next big adventure. The good news is that your current endeavors are blessed by hidden helpers, whether they are well-intentioned friends or invisible angels. The universe is offering you assistance, but you must remain open to receiving it. Start with a grateful heart and the rest is magic."
scorpio,2015-08-23,"You are loyal to your closest friends and you tend to demand a lot from them while the Sun is shining in your 11th House of Social Networking. Thankfully, others tend to come through for you now as long as you don't carry unrealistic expectations. However, you may be thinking in generalities and must clarify your needs before anyone else can jump in to help. Be as specific as possible when explaining what you want. Paradoxically, the narrower your focus, the greater the rewards."
sagittarius,2015-08-23,"Your thoughts are shifting to your career objectives as you reevaluate your overall life path. The Sun's month-long presence in your 10th House of Status attracts the attention you crave, gracing you with long overdue recognition. However, don't let your newly found popularity go to your head or you'll end up losing the respect you just earned. Although they're quite easy to confuse, fame and success are two very different beasts. Redefine your goals carefully because this time around you might just get what you want."
capricorn,2015-08-23,"Playing the role of the visionary suits you now because your view of the future is ultimately a practical one. Nevertheless, you still can get carried away with the most pragmatic ideas today, blowing them out of proportion until they have no value at all. The best way to put sensible constraints on your agenda is to set aside specific times for free-floating meditation. Letting your mind wander allows you to entertain your desires and still return to solid ground with a clear head and a positive attitude."
aquarius,2015-08-23,"Your confidence is on the upswing these days with a flurry of social activities penciled in on your calendar. However, you are uncharacteristically drawn to examine your feelings today, leading you to choose an intimate discussion with a confidant over the chance to engage in a philosophical debate with friends. Luckily, your psychological deep diving will be rewarded as the Sun and bountiful Jupiter dance in your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation. But there's no going it halfway with your commitment now; you're either all the way in or completely out when it comes to matters of the heart."
pisces,2015-08-23,"Your world view is expanded through your relationships while the Sun warms your 7th House of Companions. It's hard to make a bad judgment call since happy-go-lucky Jupiter is busy blessing all types of partnerships now. Happily, compelling people show up at your doorstep with  interesting opportunities in tow. However, the danger in saying yes to every good idea you hear is spreading yourself so thin you fall short in all your endeavors. If you want a different outcome, make a different choice. Listen to your heart and you can't go wrong."
aries,2015-08-24,"You probably don't realize just how close you are to achieving your dreams, even if you assume everything will work out in the end. You have sufficient strength to face a tough issue as your unflagging optimism overrides any negativity today, empowering you to take risks and do great things. But the bad news is how far from reality you might wander now if given the chance. Keep in mind that you do your best work if you can see the amazing potential without losing your objectivity. In the long run, authenticity is your friend."
taurus,2015-08-24,"A recent lack of progress casts a big shadow in your life today, and you might become confused about your overall direction. However, you don't necessarily have to start from scratch or try a new approach. In spite of the uncertainty, you can still visualize positive potential everywhere you look, even where it once didn't exist. Stay open to all the exciting roads that appear in front of you, but don't commit to any one path yet. Use this time wisely to let your head catch up to your heart."
gemini,2015-08-24,"People are laying on the charm today as they persuade you to participate in a project that's not yet on your radar. Or, maybe someone is pushing you to skip your personal responsibilities  so you can join a larger cause. However, you don't need any external distractions since you already have plenty of your own. For now, let others continue on their way without you while you stick to your original agenda. Making the responsible choice isn't always easy, but you will be satisfied with your accomplishments at the end of the day if you do."
cancer,2015-08-24,"You might fantasize about breaking out of your regular routine now, but you're probably not ready to step out of the box quite yet. Trust your instincts; there's no reason to question your prudence. The fact of the matter is it's more productive to make minor adjustments gradually than instigating one big change today. Whatever you do, just keep inching forward; every small step in the right direction counts."
leo,2015-08-24,"You're the king or queen of the jungle and you can perform quite a show while the evocative Moon lights up your sign, inspiring you to roar with confidence. Maybe you're motivated by knowing how proudly you could strut your stuff today if you tried. Nevertheless, you must tread cautiously because your imaginary games are nothing like reality's challenges. Don't be complacent; make your dreams come true by giving them voice and taking bold action while the cosmos is smiling in your direction."
virgo,2015-08-24,"Unexpected events trigger intense reactions today, and you may grow uncomfortable if you sense your response is perceived as out of control. Nevertheless, it's not necessary to place arbitrary limits on your heart now just to increase your emotional security. Sometimes taking a risk is better for your soul than playing it safe. Let your feelings flow and spend time with whatever inspires you most. Take the road less traveled; follow your bliss and see where it goes."
libra,2015-08-24,"Your world seems lighter and brighter these days, but you might be secretly afraid that this positive phase won't last too much longer. Unfortunately, you can't rely on your friends for help now because they seem to be busy following their own callings. Although nothing is permanent, stressing about possible trouble in the future is a complete waste of a beautiful day. By consciously concentrating on the blessings of the present moment, the good times will last longer than you expect."
scorpio,2015-08-24,"Although you may think you created an impossible dilemma, self-doubt or self-criticism is a blatant misuse of your precious time. You will only make matters worse by thinking about everything you should have done differently. Luckily, today's upbeat Sagittarius Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, supplying you with the resolve you need to break familiar patterns. Focusing on your strengths instead of your shortcomings empowers you to work wonders and make up for past mistakes. Go forth and prosper."
sagittarius,2015-08-24,"You are dreaming of the distant horizon and you're not interested in settling for anything less than the outer limits of experience now. Set your career goals as ambitiously as you can because your current choices will motivate you for weeks to come. Luckily, there's no reason to hold back while the Moon traipses through your adventurous sign today. However, your journey will be much lighter  if you don't try to carry your past baggage with you. Hurry up; the future is not-so-patiently waiting for you to arrive."
capricorn,2015-08-24,"It appears as if someone could be working against you now but your efforts to uncover the source of the plot may not be that effective. Nevertheless, you're likely to keep trying, hoping that a careless accomplice will drop a clue that leads you to solving the mystery. However, it's not wise to fight secrecy with your own hidden agenda; you're likely to gain more support if you are forthcoming with your intentions. Climbing out on a limb and sharing some little-known facts about yourself might help to reestablish a climate of trust and change the interpersonal dynamics for the better."
aquarius,2015-08-24,"You may be the incurable optimist today until someone's unexpected emotional outburst catches you totally off guard. Fortunately, you can transform a delicate situation into one of great promise, but you can't attach your happiness to any one specific outcome. If you maintain a cool and calm disposition now, you just might be unstoppable at whatever you choose to do. Anything is possible when you take life's surprises in stride. Attitude is everything when you are a superhero in disguise."
pisces,2015-08-24,"Your intuition channel is wide open today, whether or not you publicly acknowledge such things. Fortunately, you are quite likely to receive an unexpected jolt of cosmic juice, inspiring you to aim for greater heights. However, it's still wise to keep your emotions under control; the upcoming changes will be much easier to navigate if you rely on logic now to keep your life in balance. Following a hunch works best if you also check your facts along the way."
aries,2015-08-25,"You're known for being quick to react when something goes awry and you don't always take the time to consider anyone else's perspective. However, today's traditional Capricorn Moon is moving through your 10th House of Public Responsibility, requiring you to be on your best behavior. Proceed carefully instead of shooting from the hip; a well-aimed intention clears the path for your direct action. Trust your intuition; paradoxically, it will show you the most practical course of action now, which is exactly what you need."
taurus,2015-08-25,"The big pieces of the puzzle may appear to fall into place today, but, unfortunately, you still won't feel completely at ease. It's comforting if your life has settled down sufficiently for you to have some time to relax, but you might think you're missing something important now. Fortunately, the Sun and Moon are harmonizing in practical earth signs, minimizing extraneous distractions. Worry is the greatest misuse of your imagination. Focusing on reality rather than your anxiety is your best preparation for whatever occurs next."
gemini,2015-08-25,"It's wise to graciously accept the generous support of your closest friends and family, for they supply the solid foundation that you might lack on your own today. The assistance you need now isn't financial or physical; you just want to know that others have faith in you and believe in your dreams. But don't sit around waiting for someone to ride to your rescue; ask for help and you shall receive. You can soar to new heights when your allies act as the wind beneath your wings."
cancer,2015-08-25,"People may want to lean on your shoulder because you have a tender spot for those in need. Rather than feeling like you are required to fix anything today, you're content with simply listening to their hopes and dreams. Your compassion is sweet, but now it's essential to fulfill your obligations and address your own needs, too. Remember, you will have more to give others if you are satisfied with your place in the world. The heart is a muscle; the more you use it, the more it grows."
leo,2015-08-25,"Stick to your daily routine as closely as possible, even if you're tempted to shake things up today. Nevertheless, you still must remain flexible when handling changing circumstances because unexpected events may pull you off schedule now. Don't be overly judgmental when responding to someone's emotional drama; instead, show up the best you can for the ones you love before returning to the safety of your regularly scheduled program."
virgo,2015-08-25,"You may have a pressing need to tell someone exactly how you feel, especially if you're motivated by a romantic attraction. You would prefer to let your love light shine all the time, but often you turn it down low for the sake of efficiency. However, the emotional Moon brightens your 5th House of Self-Expression today, so speak your mind freely if given the chance. Instead of waiting for a better time to acknowledge your desires, let your heart be your guide."
libra,2015-08-25,"In theory, you might prefer to hide away at home today, far away from the hustle and bustle of the real world. Unfortunately, your idealized mini-retreat may not be such a great idea because you still have to go to work or run errands. Fulfilling your commitments is an admirable goal, but your spiritual well-being is important, too. It's not always easy to balance your inner needs with your outer responsibilities, but it's always worth the extra effort. Ultimately, happiness is a direction, not a destination."
scorpio,2015-08-25,"You really want to do something memorable with your friends today, but are hesitant to add anything else to your packed schedule. The earthy Capricorn Moon emphasizes your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, encouraging you to adopt a practical approach to managing your life now. If your day is already full, you may be resistant to the idea of doing more. However, once you accept an invitation, you are able to juggle your current commitments to fit everything in. Don't procrastinate; the sooner you put your calendar in order, the sooner you can join in the fun."
sagittarius,2015-08-25,"It's tempting to coast when the most significant things in life seem to be going your way. But it's more critical than ever to keep an eye on your future now because storm clouds could roll in at any moment. A two-prong strategy works best for you today. First, make the most out of the wonderful opportunities that knock at your door. Second, keep a sensible backup plan ready in case your imagined scenario doesn't live up to your expectations. Assume the best, but bring your umbrella and rain boots just in case."
capricorn,2015-08-25,"Your firm resolve to follow your current agenda is your sweet ticket to success. A perfect wave of cosmic energy is building, ready to carry you to your destination as the ambitious Capricorn Moon trines the opportunistic Sun-Jupiter conjunction. The only potential pitfall is your unwavering belief that you can scale any mountain in sight. But don't exhaust yourself trying to invent a new way to reach for the stars. Sticking with your original plan leads you straight to the top."
aquarius,2015-08-25,"You might not tell the whole truth about your intentions because your desire for self-sufficiency prompts you to hide your deepest feelings. You don't have a compelling reason to show your vulnerability now, which could subdue the intensity of an emotional interaction. There's no right or wrong way to approach a situation as long as you keep your heart open and act with kindness. It's easier in the long run to be honest today than to clean up a mess tomorrow."
pisces,2015-08-25,"You can rely on your peers to cheer you along your path today while the responsible Capricorn Moon hangs out in your 11th House of Social Networking. Your desires are pretty basic now and, thankfully, your cohorts will faithfully show up with the goods. Ironically, your friends may not be very demonstrative, but you still won't have any doubt about their love and support. Nevertheless, openly expressing your appreciation for their involvement cements the bonds of lasting friendship."
aries,2015-08-26,"It's more important than ever to establish a productive daily routine and stick to it while the auspicious Sun-Jupiter conjunction highlights your 6th House of Habits. However, you can't help but get swept up in circumstances that start out pleasurable but might quickly grow out of control. It's perfectly fine to enjoy yourself today, but the fleeting satisfaction of excessive indulgence could ultimately interfere with the real work at hand. Honoring reasonable limits is your ticket to success."
taurus,2015-08-26,"Your optimism complicates your efforts to plot a new course of action because all the possibilities look so promising. Understandably, you may not want to jeopardize your sense of well-being if everything is already clicking, and thankfully, practicality will ultimately rule the roost. Opportunities for personal growth and self-expression abound; setting clear priorities and trusting your instincts enable you to maximize the current potential and make your dreams come true."
gemini,2015-08-26,"In order to make the most of this cosmically amazing day, you must filter out the extraneous noise in your life. The greatest opportunities arise now when you schedule time for peace and quiet. You may even feel the need to pass on a last-minute invitation to join a group of coworkers for lunch. The Sun-Jupiter conjunction blesses your 4th House of Home, so don't be afraid of returning to your familiar emotional roots for the support you seek. Although you're often tempted to scatter your energy, you'll do best today by working on your own."
cancer,2015-08-26,"You are at the top of your social game because nearly everyone is singing your praises now. But don't let this lovely opportunity slip through your fingers while you are busy trying to logically figure out your next move. Instead of overthinking a situation today, speak directly from your heart. Paradoxically, the most practical rewards of the day are emotional and spiritual rather than material, and these gifts come directly from your interactions with others. Be grateful for the kindness you are shown and pay it forward when given the chance."
leo,2015-08-26,"It may seem as if money is growing on trees but if you aren't careful today, you might end up spending more than you should. The prosperous Sun-Jupiter conjunction illuminates your 2nd House of Personal Resources, enticing you to pay whatever the current price is to ride the fun train; unfortunately, you might underestimate the cost. Thankfully, your analytical skills are on point now as you navigate through a day of potential excess. Celebrate your good fortune but don't forget the bill will come due once the party is over."
virgo,2015-08-26,"Your exuberance about life puts a big smile on your face today as the joyful Sun-Jupiter conjunction expands the reaches of your practical sign. The distant horizon seems closer than ever, empowering you to soar on the wings of your unrestrained optimism. Although you are poised to take flight on the pleasure plane today, overindulging your senses could lead to a tummy ache or a splitting head tomorrow. Luckily, acknowledging your limits doesn't have to lessen your enjoyment. Play hard but be kind to yourself in the process."
libra,2015-08-26,"You may be able to float through the day without doing much work because your friends and teammates  have your back just when you need it. Naturally, your cheerful attitude doesn't hurt; in fact, your self-confidence acts as a powerful magnet that attracts the generosity of kindhearted people. There's no reason to question someone's motives today; don't look a gift horse in the mouth, especially when the planets are actively working on your behalf. Smile your best smile and say thank you more than once."
scorpio,2015-08-26,"Surrounding yourself with friends and allies is a wise strategy today; the more people involved in your life now, the merrier. Being an integral part of a group gives you a wonderful sense of belonging to a community of like-minded folks. The sweet news is that even a small amount of positive energy is amplified when you receive and reflect the love that's all around you. It's time to sparkle and shine; opening the door to your heart inspires others to do the same."
sagittarius,2015-08-26,"Although you may be concentrating on your career trajectory, you aren't driven to put in any extra effort to reach your goals today. Your unwavering confidence may lead you to believe the world owes you success because of your past accomplishments. Don't act entitled or you could inadvertently push away the very same people who show up to help you pursue your ambitions. Practicing a little humility ensures you will receive the respect and admiration that you deserve."
capricorn,2015-08-26,"Your intuitive vision is crystal clear today, enabling you to see incredible potential for growth as you gaze out into the distance. The expansive Sun-Jupiter conjunction brightens your 9th House of Big Ideas, motivating you to focus your intentions toward the fulfillment of your long-term goals. Naturally, you won't automatically receive everything you want in the future. However, your fierce determination to manifest your dreams can attract an abundance of love and prosperity into your life. Don't waste a second of this special opportunity to learn and grow."
aquarius,2015-08-26,"It might seem as if a long-lasting phase of inner growth is coming to its inevitable conclusion. Luckily, the power of your positive thinking can be transformed into successful action now, especially with respect to your social life. Rich fantasies feed your desire to connect with heart-centered people on a deeper level that goes beyond talking about the weather and sharing common interests. If you're willing to push through your own emotional discomfort you can change a personal relationship for the better. Sometimes you just have to trust the universe and make the first move."
pisces,2015-08-26,"Much to your delight, it appears as if people just want to make you happy today. Although a bountiful Sun-Jupiter conjunction shines in your 7th House of Partnerships, you still might be hesitant to trust the intentions of others. Rather than doubting anyone's integrity, accept the advice or assistance you receive at face value now. But don't succumb to the temptation of expecting more than is actually offered or you'll end up being sadly disappointed rather than pleasantly surprised with the good news."
aries,2015-08-27,"You are preoccupied with relationship issues that, ironically, grow less complicated as soon as you stop to contemplate your actions. However, if all signs point to go, you might not bother to slow down long enough to notice where you are likely to run into trouble. Taking a more proactive approach by listening to everyone's feelings enables you to gain a clear view of the road ahead. Communication is a two-way street."
taurus,2015-08-27,"Although your logic is rock solid today, you might feel like you're standing on shaky emotional ground. Talking about ideas is as easy as a day at the beach; it's the sharing of your feelings that can scare you silly. This odd dynamic may be especially disconcerting if you want to get a heartfelt expression of love out into the open. Nevertheless, you can completely miss the warning signs if you dive headfirst into the waterfall. The real challenge in front of you has nothing to do with future logistics; it's whatever emotional hurdle you must overcome in the present moment that demands your courage."
gemini,2015-08-27,"Mixed messages grow even more confusing today as the cosmic traffic signals continue to flicker and change. The bad news is you don't know what to believe as you try to make the best choice in the spur of the moment. Should you blast ahead with exuberance or make a run for the hills? Oddly enough, your execution matters more now than your decision. Your best shot at success comes from moving forward with a methodical plan in place."
cancer,2015-08-27,"Your highest hopes can be so outrageous now that it's more like blind optimism than anything else. Nevertheless, it's counterproductive to express any lingering cynicism when your positive attitude has such an inspiring impact on everyone you meet. Indulging in your fantasies is great entertainment, but don't let them interfere with your life. Instead, stay anchored to the real world while continuing to motivate others with your message. Showing up with a caring heart makes more of a difference than you think."
leo,2015-08-27,"You desperately want acknowledgment from your friends and associates, yet it's doubly important not to expect too much today. No matter how many compliments you receive now, you might still feel as if you're not being fully appreciated. Your pride may be hurt but withdrawing from the crowd only increases the gulf between you and others. Being aware of your own self-absorption can shift the energy in a positive direction. Reaching out to help others takes your mind off your own concerns and fills your heart with gratitude."
virgo,2015-08-27,"Maintaining a positive attitude cultivates healthy interactions with your colleagues, but you might set your standards so high at work today that you are courting disappointment. Nevertheless, you can still accomplish your goals as long as you don't let your imagination run wild now. Be conservative in your expectations and radical in your actions; overshoot your target instead of falling short of it. Quietly leading by example inspires others to do their fair share as well."
libra,2015-08-27,"The sweet temptation of love stretches your thoughts into new territory today. As eager as you are to imagine a perfect romance, mental Mercury's return to your sign prevents you from getting lost in the clouds. The good news is there's no reason to monitor your fantasies now, since they won't take you anywhere dangerous. Trust your natural tendency to look at both sides of every issue with an objective eye. Your unflagging logic and willing heart are a winning combination."
scorpio,2015-08-27,"You might believe the solution to your current problem is buried in your past, but it's not a simple task to recover the key memories necessary for your growth. You wish you could have more time to reminisce today, but duty calls in the present moment, pulling you away from your reverie. There's no need to dwell on your disappointment now, for the missing information is more likely to resurface only after you release your attachment to finding it. Sometimes what you're searching for shows up when you least expect it."
sagittarius,2015-08-27,"Your eagerness to ignore red flags tempts you to pack too much into your current calendar. Be forewarned; you can't determine how long it takes to finish a task if you don't consider all the details that are part of the process. It's pointless to complain if you fall behind schedule today, especially when demonstrating your adaptability is all that people need from you now. The sooner you respond to the new reality, the better your chances are of making the most of the intriguing opportunities in the air."
capricorn,2015-08-27,"Miscalculating your resources could lead to a rude awakening when you realize that you don't have as much cash on hand as you thought. Or, perhaps, you belatedly realize your current expenses are greater than you expected. Either way, you must step up to the plate quickly so you can make the most sensible choices to rectify the imbalance. Procrastination is not your friend now; no one will fault you for a simple mistake if you're willing to take full accountability for your actions."
aquarius,2015-08-27,"Your compromise to a lingering relationship disagreement doesn't quite seem to do the trick today, even if you thought your idea was more than fair. However, your heart grows heavy if your friends or coworkers appear incapable of understanding your message. There's no reason to struggle now to convey your intentions; your suggestions are still valid for you, even if they don't work for anyone else. No matter how things turn out, give yourself credit for trying to meet others halfway."
pisces,2015-08-27,"Your intuition continues to work its magic, but the positive images you're receiving today could escalate relationship dynamics unless you heed all of the signs. In fact, you're tempted to jump to conclusions and make assumptions about others that just aren't true. Even your closest friends might think you lost your ability to see the writing on the wall. Instead of listening to everyone's opinions, stick to the facts. A simple reality check might be all you need now to regain a healthy perspective."
aries,2015-08-28,"Your dreams about love are likely to be more interesting now than the actual events in your everyday life, magnifying your awareness of what you are lacking in the romance department. Your internal chatter is loud, tempting you to share your current desires with others. Nevertheless, it may be wiser to keep your running commentary to yourself because you can't foresee  someone's reaction. Some things are better left unexpressed; it's best to face the fact that today's fantasies simply might be more enjoyable than anything you can conjure up in the real world."
taurus,2015-08-28,"You would rather do nearly anything today other than what's expected of you. Curious Mercury is agitating your key planet Venus, distracting you with one enticing possibility after another. You can play all the various scenarios through your mind a hundred times, but you still may not be able to make any of them work well enough to justify dropping your previous commitments. Don't be surprised if you end up returning to your original plan, since in the final analysis it might be the best pick over the alternatives."
gemini,2015-08-28,"Your rash behavior surprises your friends and family, especially if you lose your cool today. Everyone might think you're acting irresponsibly, but you could see things quite differently. You are giving a great deal of thought to your current options and are willing to risk your emotional security for the chance to rock your world. Ultimately, you must follow your instincts and hope others will admire your originality and courage down the road."
cancer,2015-08-28,"Toss out your inhibitions today as you dream about an exciting journey to someplace far away. It really doesn't matter whether or not you actually pack your bags and go anywhere; the sense of freedom that you feel when envisioning your exotic escape makes it all worthwhile. But as bold as you can be within the imaginary realms, it's not necessary to fight against the practical considerations that bring you back to your current reality. Balancing both sides of the equation allows you to enjoy the best of both worlds."
leo,2015-08-28,"You are integrally connected to your deeply rooted feelings today, but you're frustrated because you can't express your desires in words. Your passions run strong and your emotional reactions are so extreme now that it may be in your best interest to remain quiet rather than burdening others with your drama. Although procrastination is far from a permanent solution to your dilemma, expressing yourself will come more naturally tomorrow. In the meantime, channeling your angst into your work is a constructive expression of your creativity."
virgo,2015-08-28,"You are so enthusiastic about your personal and business relationships today partly because you understand how they are supporting your goals. Nevertheless, you're also acutely aware you're not totally free to say what's on your mind, for you could easily upset the status quo if you do. Even if you are tempted to ask for what you want, it may be prudent to wait until next week. Patience is your strongest ally now as long as you keep one eye on your goal at all times. Timing is everything."
libra,2015-08-28,"There's way too much chaos in your world today, leading you to take matters into your own hands. However, the more you try to quiet things down, the noisier they become. Exerting your will over others is a dead-end strategy that won't bring you satisfactory results. Although you're tempted to look outside of yourself for answers, it's much more effective to elevate your attitude than to change anyone else's. Sometimes, leading by example is all you can do."
scorpio,2015-08-28,"You aren't thrilled about the current restraints on your self-expression -- you have a lot to say today, but can't seem to find the appropriate channel to get your thoughts out. Fortunately, feeding the flames of your hope acts like a magnet, attracting the right people who can help you make some positive changes. An alchemical transformation that turns a difficult situation into the magic of pure light is possible if you respect the limitations being placed upon you now. Counting your blessings never hurts."
sagittarius,2015-08-28,"You're walking through a metaphysical minefield today, making it critical to uncover the potential trouble spots in your current plan before you reach them. However, the sooner in the day you revise your calendar to make time for contemplation and prayer, the better your chances of keeping the rest of your schedule intact. Fixating on an arbitrary goal is an exercise in futility now. Adopting a proactive perspective encourages the illusions to fall to the wayside. Keep the faith; your temporary disappointment will seed new spiritual growth."
capricorn,2015-08-28,"Your heightened expectations drive you to take every moment of your life more seriously now. However, you want others to admire how self-contained you are in your approach to getting things done. Resist the temptation to break a few minor rules in order to catch someone's eye. Shortcuts seem to work for everyone else, but your safest route to success is taking the tried and true path to your destination. Don't stray from your natural rhythm; you can cover more distance than anyone else as long as you march to your own music."
aquarius,2015-08-28,"A highly inflated view of your finances today encourages you to lead an extravagant lifestyle. In particular, it's wise to avoid an impulsive purchase of something you covet but, in all honesty, could do without. Don't squander your money on material distractions when there are more important matters to address. A practical mindset to managing your cash flow is less fun, but a dose of frugality serves you better in the long run. A penny saved is a penny earned."
pisces,2015-08-28,"The stars in your eyes twinkle brightly as you step outside of your regular comfort zone today. Something wonderful is afoot, and you're eager to  accept an invitation to shine on center stage. Tread lightly; you could upset the security that you worked so hard to achieve by gambling your future on a risky venture now. There's no simple answer to your predicament, so reconsider all options carefully before saying yes. Follow your heart, but stop to listen to your head first."
aries,2015-08-29,"You're planning to head out on a vision quest while the psychic Pisces Full Moon brightens your 12th House of Spirituality. However, you might have to delay your fleeting flights of fancy so you can finish up the chores that are currently on your calendar. Surprisingly, even the most boring routine holds the potential for magic today. It's not about what you're doing in the real world now; it's about your newly found ability to travel in time and space. Simultaneously working both ends of the spectrum -- the cosmic and the mundane -- brings the greatest emotional satisfaction."
taurus,2015-08-29,"You hope to share your interests with imaginative people who care about the same things you do. The Pisces Full Moon lights up your 11th House of Friends, inviting you to express your tentative plans for the future in a safe environment. Even if you're short on time, surround yourself with people who will ultimately support your wildest ideas. Luckily, you don't have to worry about being practical now in order to discuss your dreams. Just remember it's not all about you; don't forget to return the favor by encouraging others in their pursuits, too."
gemini,2015-08-29,"Your current obsession with achieving recognition is reflected in your ambitious daydreams about your professional life today. But it's difficult to keep your feet on the ground when the otherworldly Pisces Full Moon shines in your 10th House of Status. Nevertheless, you can make the most progress by using your common sense to navigate your course instead of falling back on your intuition. Taking all the variables into consideration helps you climb the ladder of success."
cancer,2015-08-29,"Forget all the reasons why you shouldn't take a risk now; just make the day an exercise in writing your own itinerary for a truly fantastic adventure. The boundless Pisces Full Moon expands your 9th House of Distant Horizons, inspiring you to pursue your dreams and explore new lands. However, planning too far in advance doesn't work because you can't imagine what you might encounter along the way. Achieving satisfaction is more likely if you reserve the option to alter your direction as your feelings change."
leo,2015-08-29,"You're searching for more direct ways to reach new levels of intimacy in a relationship today. You can actually feel the energy intensifying as the spiritual Pisces Full Moon casts a large shadow in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Unfortunately, you don't necessarily have a solid understanding of the big picture, preventing you from gaining a clear perspective on your feelings. But don't get hung up on the details of communication; relying on words only limits the current experience. You can return to a conversation to fill in the specifics later on after you have connected on a deeper emotional level."
virgo,2015-08-29,"You think your logic is invincible today and that you can reason your way through nearly any situation. However, others may not be so convinced your strategy is a viable one while the nebulous Pisces Moon illuminates your 7th House of Companions, muddying all forms of communication, especially in relationships. Don't try to defend your plan if you encounter resistance now. No one is interested in your careful analysis at this time; all they want to know is the bottom line. Your actions will convey more meaning than anything you can say."
libra,2015-08-29,"You want to share a long-lost dream with someone special today. But there's no reason to panic if you can't recall all the fine points of your story, since you can sink into your subconscious to recover them now. But don't expect a treasure map with clear directions to suddenly appear out of nowhere. The fantasy-prone Pisces Full Moon floods your 6th House of Details, indicating that you might have to fudge some facts to fill in the ones you don't know. Keep your integrity in mind since adding the right amount of color makes the difference between failure and success when revealing your truth."
scorpio,2015-08-29,"You wake up with a smile on your face as the spiritual Pisces Full Moon raises the vibration in your 5th House of Fun. Your positive frame of mind is so powerful that you believe extra preparation isn't necessary. Luckily, this happy-go-lucky assumption works in your favor now, inspiring you to make up the story line as you go along. Just remember to keep one eye on the clock or you could miss an important appointment later in the day. Spontaneity is your friend as long as you don't lose track of time."
sagittarius,2015-08-29,"You may receive your share of notoriety but you don't feel like standing under the heat of the spotlight today. You might prefer to stay behind the curtains while the Pisces Full Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Home and Family. Unfortunately, you could eventually regret your decision if you choose to sidestep any well-deserved acknowledgments. Do whatever is necessary to overcome your uncharacteristic shyness so you can put on a show that others won't forget."
capricorn,2015-08-29,"Your methodical approach to life often empowers you to develop concrete strategies to reach your ambitious goals. But the illusory Pisces Full Moon resonates in your noisy 3rd House of Immediate Environment, so you might not be as effective when attempting to put your plans into motion today. Don't promise any more than you can deliver now, for anything you commit to at this time will probably need modification before you know it. Leaving a bit of wiggle room in your schedule improves your chances for success."
aquarius,2015-08-29,"You might not realize the powerful impact you have on others, but people often set their moral compasses based upon your core values. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to see yourself clearly while the fuzzy Pisces Full Moon mirrors your 2nd House of Self-Worth. It's a challenge to walk your talk now because your spiritual beliefs are all over the map. Turn the tables by leaning on someone else to regain your  rational perspective. Asking for help shows you're just as human as everyone else."
pisces,2015-08-29,"Separating your needs from those of everyone around you can be a daunting task as the emotional Full Moon canoodles with spiritual Neptune in your compassionate sign. It's not completely your fault if you struggle to establish clear boundaries and limits today. If you're not mindful now, your desire to rescue every wounded animal, plant or person you encounter could even derail your personal plans. Wanting to help those less fortunate than you is an admirable trait as long as you don't lose yourself in the process."
aries,2015-08-30,"Taking your inner child out for ice cream today offers you an unexpected opportunity to mend a past wound. Reconnecting with your innocence gives your creativity a chance to soar to new heights. Your simple intention might be to have fun, but the activation of old memories fixes something you didn't even know was broken. There are very few sorrows that cannot be healed by the unrelenting power of love if you're willing to open your heart and let it in."
taurus,2015-08-30,"You intuitively know when to be serious and when to lighten the mood today. However, it's tougher to decide when you should share what's in your heart and when you are better off just listening to others. In the final analysis, it really doesn't matter whether you stay close to home or lose yourself in the crowd, you are a pillar of strength for your best friends. Luckily, you earn extra karma points when you step outside of yourself to help someone who could use a shoulder to lean on."
gemini,2015-08-30,"You may be motivated to volunteer your assistance for a community event today. Moving projects along quickly is your specialty and although your involvement is truly about a larger cause, you can't help but be noticed. Your intuition is on point; you know what people need now even before they do. Think of yourself as a spokesperson for the voiceless and use your moment in the sun to speak up on behalf of others. Your high visibility gives you a wonderful opportunity to put your altruistic intentions to work."
cancer,2015-08-30,"A thorough reassessment of your philosophical beliefs could lead to a dramatic boost in your self-esteem. However, you might be disheartened today because you're not getting what you need from your current religious or spiritual practice. You want to grasp the meaning of life in your hands, but you're looking for it in all the wrong places. The good news is you don't have to travel to the distant edges of the galaxy to rediscover what's in your heart. All you need to do is be open to the love that's within."
leo,2015-08-30,"You're looking good, Leo, but you're not necessarily feeling it on the inside. Thankfully, Venus and Mars are busy flirting in your sign, prompting you to show off your charisma and demonstrate your charm. Although you can easily mislead others, there's no point in fooling yourself if you don't know where you're going in your relationship life. Understanding that the universe is sending you mixed symbols alleviates the pressure today. Sometimes faking it is okay as long as you're still honest with yourself."
virgo,2015-08-30,"You can't continue on the same trajectory and keep expecting different results. Stop struggling because it's time to let go and heal; however, you're not going to solve all your problems in one day. Instead, trust your intuition when it comes to relationships. Set aside your rational approach so you can look at love from a different angle now. Adopting a more spiritual slant reveals possibilities you never even knew existed. The sky is the limit when you have the courage to believe."
libra,2015-08-30,"The mind-body connection is so palpable now that every thought you have affects your physical health. Happily, you probably feel great as long as you maintain a positive mindset. However, the bad news is that too much worrying can make you sick. Improving your self-confidence through meditation actually strengthens your immune system rather than depleting it. Your well-being is the result of mind over matter and you have the power to change things if you want."
scorpio,2015-08-30,"The atmosphere is tingling with an anticipation that you will show up and perform. However, you're not necessarily in the mood to put on a song and dance for a crowd. Instead, you might be happier sharing your true feelings, even if it's not on the program now. Remember, your authenticity is one of your greatest strengths. Judiciously revealing your vulnerability can help others on their path and heal your own wounds in the process."
sagittarius,2015-08-30,"You're tempted to play the martyr card today if someone in your immediate environment is in need of extra personal care. Naturally, assisting a loved one can be part of a higher calling, but it's still crucial to pay attention to your hidden motives. These challenging circumstances are not about engineering a noisy demonstration. Do it for the personal satisfaction you earn, and not for the recognition. Your opportunity to nurture someone else in need is one of life's sweetest rewards."
capricorn,2015-08-30,"You may be unhappy about something today but you're unable to tie your feelings up into a nice and tidy package. Unfortunately, others won't be able to rush to your rescue because they are too busy with their own lives to read your mind. Nevertheless, don't give up just because you can't get your ideas across perfectly. Your words don't have to be perfect to serve their purpose; at least your attempts to clarify your intentions demonstrates your willingness to communicate and connect."
aquarius,2015-08-30,"Your self-esteem is intrinsically entangled with your material possessions now. You might believe that the more you lavish tokens of your affection upon someone, the more they will love you. However, it doesn't matter whether you're on the giving or receiving end, all the gifts in the world won't bring you the emotional satisfaction you seek. Earning lasting adoration only comes from sincere offerings of the heart. Money can't buy you love."
pisces,2015-08-30,"Turning the tables by identifying yourself as a survivor instead of a victim is a necessary step to taking charge of your life. Quit waiting for Superwoman to save the day when you are the one with the power to heal yourself. Buddha said that life is suffering and your heightened sensitivity puts you in touch with your compassionate nature. You can't escape the worries of the world when you care as deeply as you do. Your empathetic heart is one of your superpowers, so don't be afraid to use it when it can do such good."
aries,2015-08-31,"You want to swoop in and heroically save the day as you negotiate for the common good. Nevertheless, you're not fully prepared to set aside your personal needs now that the sensitive Moon is hanging out in your sign. Walking the fine line between fighting for a cause and honoring your own priorities is your number one challenge today. No one expects you to drop everything, but taking one for the team demonstrates the generosity of your heart and the depth of your character."
taurus,2015-08-31,"You surprise others by bringing a highly spiritual perspective to your relationships today. Thankfully, you can count on your common sense to keep you grounded while you gather facts and gain much-needed clarity. But don't pretend you know exactly whats going on now; allow yourself to drift in the imaginary dimensions, even if it makes you uneasy. There's plenty of magic to be found if you can surrender to the unknown."
gemini,2015-08-31,"You may find yourself swinging back and forth like a pendulum between the largest possible view of your life and the tiniest of details. Your imagination is soaring, allowing you to see every issue from a global perspective today. But it's difficult to act on a grandiose vision while floating up in the clouds. Bringing your mental meandering back down to earth is highly advisable now. Find small ways to move toward the big picture and you'll be fine."
cancer,2015-08-31,"You're not as resistant to change as everyone thinks. After all, the Crab's daily rhythms are intimately entangled with the constantly shifting tides. But as emotional currents finally begin to turn today, it's challenging to tell which way the waters will ultimately flow. Float in place for a little while longer; once the confusion clears you can happily set sail while the wind is blowing in your direction. Working with the cosmic energy is key to your success."
leo,2015-08-31,"If a close friend or partner is hard to read, it may be that your own confusion is broadcasting mixed messages which now echo back to you. If you are uncertain about a relationship, don't fall into the trap of acting as if everything is okay. By covering up your feelings today, you are setting the stage for more misunderstandings to surface tomorrow. Being honest about your needs encourages others to do the same. Nevertheless, imagining the best possible outcome opens the door to stronger connections."
virgo,2015-08-31,"Your spiritual curiosity is growing by leaps and bounds today, while your current metaphysical interests take on greater significance. Subtle changes are occurring in your energy field now, even if their effects aren't yet visible. Although there are shifts on the horizon, the transformation is already beginning in your subconscious. Nothing useful comes from worrying about things you can't control. You can fully benefit from what's transpiring in your imagination if you don't sweat the small stuff and let the magic happen."
libra,2015-08-31,"You are proud of being the uncontested champ of the balancing act, yet you're feeling somewhat unsettled today. The cosmic conflict between the willful Sun and surreal Neptune pulls you in two directions. Part of you is busy ascending into spiritual realms as another part sticks around to handle the very real limitations of the material world. You may idealize the situation, yet it is essential to see things as they truly are now. Honoring the invisible and the tangible ensures that you'll be ready for whatever happens next."
scorpio,2015-08-31,"Although you might not know your exact destination these days, your role in the outer world is still highly significant to you. You wonder if you should doggedly pursue your career or focus your efforts on the creative dimensions of your life. However, there aren't any quick and easy answers to your existential dilemma. Simplify the issues as much as possible and then let yourself feel what it's like to linger in your own uncertainty. The longer you sustain the mystery, the easier the resolution will be when clarity finally arrives."
sagittarius,2015-08-31,"You often gravitate toward the most outrageous projects, since you enjoy living life on the edge. But the problem is you may not always attend to all the details and sometimes they can come back to haunt you. You don't have a strong inclination to return from your current dreams yet if you're wandering through the outer limits of the universe. However, you might not have a choice if unexpected changes at work require you to be on your toes. Everyone will be extremely relieved if you take your cues from reality now; save your explorations for another day and choose the responsible path."
capricorn,2015-08-31,"You feel the need to change things up in your everyday life but you're clueless on where to begin. Start by pulling away from more practical realms since magical Neptune is lifting you into the clouds of illusion now, making it tricky to keep both feet on the ground anyhow. Although others might expect you to stick closely to the actual facts, you can easily misunderstand each other if you do. Listening with your heart enables you to read between the lines and catch the meaning behind the words."
aquarius,2015-08-31,"Intimate relationships may be the source of great confusion today, especially if you don't pay close attention to what your partner is saying. In fact, it could take superhuman effort to hear the truth because words can get in the way of the real message. Don't force your perspective on anyone else. The solution to the current tension comes from recognizing multiple points of view and allowing them to coexist side by side now without panicking. Practicing unconditional love isn't always easy but it's the best use of your heart."
pisces,2015-08-31,"Checking off each item on your list of things to do as early as possible allows you to get down to the important work of the day. The truth is that you may find it very challenging to maintain focus while the brilliant Sun opposes your key planet Neptune. Nevertheless, the cosmic advice is for you to spend more time daydreaming now rather than overcompensating with busy work. Today's spiritual journey feeds your imagination and nourishes your soul."
aries,2015-09-01,"You have an unexpected chance to follow your impulses and an excellent prospect that everything will turn out in your favor. But chasing the whims of your heart is always a tricky business that comes without a guarantee. Reigniting an old flame is possible now that hot-to-trot Mars is busy doing the tango with sentimental Venus. Just be careful not to take a playful flirtation to the wrong conclusion. Some things from the past are best left to remain a sweet memory. As Tom Petty sings, ""You can look back, babe, but it's best not to stare."""
taurus,2015-09-01,You're caught up in an emotional tug of war between being there for those you love and needing time alone to nurture your soul. Balancing your desire to experience the great wide open with your longing for the safety of your nest is your top priority today. Your happiness depends on finding ways to explore new vistas without causing any collateral damage at home. Being creative can't just be a pleasant pastime now; leave your stamp of originality on everything you do.
gemini,2015-09-01,"You are like a busy bee buzzing around the hive, happy to be in the midst of the action. Even if you have a mission in mind, you're likely to jump from one flower after another as you work your way through the day. You're in your element when engaging in lighthearted flirting or casual banter. Nevertheless, it's critical now to pay attention to how other people's experiences are different from yours. It's all fun and games until someone gets his or her feelings hurt; a  little sensitivity on your part saves the day."
cancer,2015-09-01,"The spotlight is on you today, whether or not you're ready for it. Unfortunately, your awkwardness is apparent if you're expected to put on a command performance. You might be afraid of losing your self-confidence if you don't come through with the goods. But finding self-esteem through the praise of others isn't a permanent fix to your insecurities. Luckily, all you have to do is show up and be your authentic self. With Venus and Mars cheering you on from the sidelines now, you'll be loved and adored for exactly who you are by those who matter most."
leo,2015-09-01,"Romance is in the air today and your magnetism is nearly irresistible to everyone you meet. Your love light is shining brightly and others can't help but notice your passionate nature. But if amorous activities aren't on your mind these days, simply channel your energy into a financial venture because you can't miss with Lady Luck in your corner. Abundance can be yours if you're willing to think with your head and act from your heart."
virgo,2015-09-01,Your casual demeanor and cool logic may fool others today. You present one thing on the surface while something much more mysterious is going on behind the scenes. There's another whole world of dynamics that you don't feel like sharing now unless someone appears who is worthy of your trust. But don't shut down too quickly without giving others the benefit of the doubt. Revealing your vulnerability is a prerequisite to establishing deeper emotional connections.
libra,2015-09-01,"When it comes to love or prosperity, you benefit the most when you're surrounded by people you admire. Your natural affinity to making friends is highlighted as today's romantic Venus-Mars conjunction sweetens your 11th House of Social Networking. But don't let your emotions turn a wonderful interaction into something bigger than it is in reality. Graciously accepting others for who they are empowers them to do the same for you."
scorpio,2015-09-01,"Taking a risk at work may be the best move you can make when the Moon runs into unpredictable Uranus in your 6th House of Employment. Luckily, your coworkers will be suitably impressed with your creative edge today, especially if you let your originality shine without restraint. In fact, adding a few flourishes of your own is like the icing on a tasty cake. It's not enough to just show up and smile now; you must convince others you're producing the greatest masterpiece of your life."
sagittarius,2015-09-01,"Your unwavering belief in the inherent good of the universe allows you to express your feelings with a flair. You don't have to waste precious time trying to meet the expectations of others today; you only need to aim high when reestablishing your creative goals. Let your positive attitude set an example for the entire world to see, whether you're visiting another country or just shopping at the local market. If one small act of kindness can change someone's day for the better, think about the difference you could make over the course of a lifetime."
capricorn,2015-09-01,"Someone may be encouraging you to flirt with the edge today, but your inner alarm bells are ringing incessantly. You're flattered that others believe in your talents enough to urge you on, but at the same time you're concerned about the practical logistics of overstepping your self-imposed limits. However, if you stay home you might miss out on something special that could rock your world. Life is a gamble, especially when it comes to matters of the heart."
aquarius,2015-09-01,"A relationship dance takes center stage today as you try to sort out what each of you wants. If you're not careful you could get overwhelmed by all the demands. Naturally, your heart yearns to play, but a healthy amount of discernment is necessary to put all the pieces in place. However, you can't climb up into an ivory tower to solve the world's problems when you're needed in the trenches with the ones you love. Think globally, act locally."
pisces,2015-09-01,"Put your faith into action and your money where your mouth is while Venus and Mars are cavorting in your 6th House of Logistics. The waiting game is over; it's time to show the world what you're made of. Your self-esteem is enmeshed with your actions now, so practice conscious acts of kindness within the confines of your daily routine. You can add joy to your life, and the lives of everyone around you, by choosing compassion over fear every chance you get."
aries,2015-09-02,"Never has crossing things off your to-do list felt so satisfying as it does today while the Moon is generously supporting Jupiter in your 6th House of Logistics. However, your mind is on the future and the anticipation is driving you crazy. There's no question about your intentions; you are on a mission. Although your work ethic is admirable now, leave some room in your busy schedule for a pleasant surprise. An unplanned detour might reveal a new road that's a reliable shortcut to your success."
taurus,2015-09-02,"You're happy to be in your element now that the evocative Moon is back home in your earthy sign. Nevertheless, you may be tempted to slow down and indulge your senses instead of trying to make the most of the current cosmic energy. Planning your day before jumping in and getting started improves your chances of finding happiness today. Focusing on your long-term goals motivates you to get off the couch and do something truly amazing. You only live once."
gemini,2015-09-02,"It's a surprising relief when you realize you don't have to be the life of the party today, and the notion of a little peace and quiet is just what the doctor ordered. Use your time wisely by integrating recent experiences through practicing meditation, putting your thoughts down in a journal or just taking a much-needed nap. Don't rush the process; you will instinctively know when you're ready to jump back into the fray. Even the most social of butterflies need to rest their tired wings now and then."
cancer,2015-09-02,"You might feel like a baby bird that's being poked and prodded in order to push you out of the nest. You begrudgingly go to the edge of your comfort zone but hesitate to take flight. It seems as if there's no safe middle ground today and you're not sure which direction to head. You may want to run and hide now if others try to coerce you with emotional triggers. Nevertheless, remaining as open-minded as possible works to your advantage. Summon your courage; spread your wings and fly."
leo,2015-09-02,Demonstrating your leadership skills comes naturally but your irrepressible confidence can stir up the pot if you're not careful today. The best leaders run alongside the pack rather than barking commands from behind. But racing too far out in front of others inhibits your ability to be in charge while also robbing you of the camaraderie generated in the collaborative process. Someone else might have a brilliant idea that can be incorporated into your strategy if you don't let your pride stand in the way. Adopting an inclusive approach is a win-win for all parties involved.
virgo,2015-09-02,"You can see the positive results of your recent kindness to others today as your life slowly starts to return to normal. But a return to simpler times is not in the picture while expansive Jupiter is busy planting seeds in your sign. A renewed sense of clarity instills your soul with a feeling of purpose and amplifies your self-esteem. Opportunities for growth are already floating around in the atmosphere, encouraging you to explore unconventional ideas. However, you must take the initiative while the universe is blessing your endeavors; you reap only what you sow."
libra,2015-09-02,"You may feel like hiding your head under the covers, but that's not the best use of today's introspective cosmic energy. Allow plenty of time for contemplation in your busy schedule, but don't let things get out of your control. However, productivity is less important now than your spiritual growth. Keep in mind that your philosophical frame of mind has more value in the long run than you realize. Although the planets are prompting you to hastily retreat into your imagination, don't forget to inform your loved ones of your plans for the day. Respect begets respect."
scorpio,2015-09-02,The practical support you receive today truly touches your heart. You breathe a welcome sigh of relief when you finally recognize you can tear down some of your protective walls because you're in the company of true friends. It's almost like slipping into a favorite pair of shoes as people provide for you in business or pleasure. This cosmic moment is a remedial lesson in accepting the generosity of others. Applying what you learn with grace and gratitude is the only sensible response.
sagittarius,2015-09-02,"It's all too easy to play the role of the drama queen today, but there's really no need to push anything over the edge. You know that everyone has perceptual differences but your moderation is someone else's extreme. Tone down your enthusiasm just a notch if you want your audience to be impressed with what you're bringing to the table. A little less rhetoric and a bit more sincerity is your ticket to success. The fact of the matter is you're on a roll now, and if your intentions are honorable you can't miss."
capricorn,2015-09-02,"Just like King Midas everything you touch seems to turn to gold today. However, anything that's too good to be true probably has a catch hidden somewhere. The current planetary emphasis is in your 9th House of Big Ideas, encouraging you to live life large now. But don't think for a moment that you're idly lost in trivial daydreams. Your current reverie isn't just a creative lark; you're embarking on a deeper exploration to discover the key to manifesting your dreams."
aquarius,2015-09-02,"You feel a sense of duty to consider the perspectives of your coworkers and friends while envisioning all that you want to do now. You have an unquenchable desire for independence, but emotional attachments seem to crimp your style. It's almost like others are purposefully keeping you from your destiny. Nevertheless, you can't bypass the intensity of your feelings when dealing with people's agendas. Normally, you tend to avoid drama at all costs; however, today you might have to engage in a spirited dialogue to obtain the beloved freedom you seek."
pisces,2015-09-02,"Relationship problems almost seem to solve themselves today as the easygoing Taurus Moon aligns with the Sun and Jupiter in your 7th House of Others. Although there's no need on your part to initiate action, you still must show up and stick around when the going gets real -- even if you're tempted to bolt. Lucky for you, the Cosmic Accountant is keeping close track of your karmic credit. Do unto others as you would have them do unto you."
aries,2015-09-03,"People seem more even-keeled today with Mercury's presence in your 7th House of Others, but they might have hidden agendas that you can't decipher. Nevertheless, there's magic in the air and it's up to you to discern what is real and what is not. You like to take folks at face value but you grow more skeptical as the layers fall away to reveal more mystery the deeper you go. Don't be concerned if you discover you jumped to a wrong conclusion. Never judge a book by its cover. The outcome could surpass your imagination if you're willing to readjust your expectations and move on."
taurus,2015-09-03,"The more you try to make sense out of a power struggle today, the more complicated the plot grows. You assume that gathering additional information will empower you to come out on the winning end. However, you're not going to get to the bottom of the story now, no matter how many questions you ask. Stop chasing the facts and just follow your intuition. Paradoxically, letting your imagination take the wheel is your best way to stay on the road."
gemini,2015-09-03,"Your responsibilities weigh heavily on your shoulders today, but adopting an unconventional strategy enables you to get everything finished on time. However, your creative approach may be nearly impossible for others to comprehend. Even if you produce something special, your colleagues can't see how your current artistic pursuits help you fulfill your previous commitments. Instead of waiting for the approval of anyone else now, set your intentions and get down to work. The proof is in the pudding."
cancer,2015-09-03,You are such a pro at turning your home into a safe haven that you can keep the complications of the world at bay. But focusing your energy on your personal space is not about isolating yourself from others. Create a comfortable place where people drop by simply because they know they'll receive your tender loving care. Welcoming others into your sanctuary acts as an elixir for your soul today. But stick to safe topics of conversation to cultivate a nurturing and peaceful environment. Home is where your heart is.
leo,2015-09-03,"It feels as if you're putting out fires everywhere you go these days. It's perfectly understandable if you grow weary of handling one complication after another since the crises never seem to end. You might believe you can step back and let someone else run the show now, but others aren't as quick to let you recede into the sidelines. Just to be fair, do your part plus a little more and then walk away. Setting clear boundaries is the only way out of this mess."
virgo,2015-09-03,"You crave to be free of obligations so you can explore fascinating new ideas but people appear to misread your signals today. They might act weirdly because they feel rejected or abandoned by you -- but that's not your intention at all. Happily, you're just chasing your own personal pursuit of happiness. Instead of focusing on everyone else's reactions, be straightforward about your motives now. No one can find fault in your actions if you're honest about what matters the most to you."
libra,2015-09-03,"You are busy attempting to uphold your reputation as the peacemaker of the group today. However, arbitrating a conflict requires you to know exactly where everyone stands on the issues at hand. But the problem is other people's positions remain a complete mystery to you now. If you stop to reassess all the variables, it's apparent you can't solve every dilemma. Honestly, there are more riddles in life than answers."
scorpio,2015-09-03,"Although you might find yourself to be more comfortable in the imaginary realms today, steering clear of real-world commitments can be particularly tricky. Whatever you do, keep your loyal fan base in the loop. You can count on your allies to support your creative pursuits any time you ask, so don't leave your friends in the dark when it comes to your latest inspiration. The more involved they feel in your process now, the happier everyone will be with your success in the long run."
sagittarius,2015-09-03,"So many people are vying for your attention today that you don't know where to begin. Or, perhaps, your avoidance of details is making someone else climb the walls. Either way, you need to get back to basics when it comes to your daily routine. Don't add any more complications to your day; you already have too many distractions on your calendar. In the meantime, choose the simplest solution at every junction along the way."
capricorn,2015-09-03,"The sooner you set aside your goals for the day, the quicker you'll find personal satisfaction. As much as you enjoy climbing the ladder of success, you're not going to make much progress today. Relaxing your expectations allows you to let down your hair and kick up your heels. Choosing a radical course of action fuels your excitement to get an early start on a pleasant weekend. Take fun as seriously as you do your work and you will have the time of your life."
aquarius,2015-09-03,"You are on the hunt for someone who is willing to view your photos and hear your tales of your last great adventure. Or you're searching for a friend who will listen to you expound on your plans for the next trip of a lifetime. However, there's no need to feel disappointment if others aren't giving you the attention you desire today. Once you realize that everyone else is also caught up in their own worlds now, you won't be so fast to judge them or expect more. Live and let live; sometimes, your best dreaming is done alone."
pisces,2015-09-03,"You can feel the unspoken conflict between your colorful imagination and other people's sensible agendas today. Your friends or relatives may already have big plans for the weekend and are happy to have you play along. But you feel like sticking to your own idea of fun for a change. Although this is not a great time to issue ultimatums, it's not wise to just give in, either. Instead of the nice fish that swims with the school, be prepared to dart off in your own direction in order to follow the whims of your heart."
aries,2015-09-04,"Although setting limits might be the smartest thing you can do today, self-restraint is not likely on your agenda. In fact, your plans could grow even larger in scale as the reflective Moon crosses paths with expansive Jupiter. Nevertheless, details count just as much as the big picture. You may have to pay for your poor judgment sooner than you think if you don't strictly adhere to the rules. Luckily, following a tried and true path enables you to swiftly reach your destination. Better safe than sorry when it comes to matters of importance."
taurus,2015-09-04,"Everyone seems to be more excited about the future than you today, but you're able to sustain your lower level of enthusiasm for longer periods of time. It takes a while for you to warm up your energy and it could take even longer to settle it back down. Just make sure that your optimism is grounded in reality or you could lose your way before you know it. Focusing on a single destination allows you to make the most of your current positivity and unflagging stamina."
gemini,2015-09-04,"You might momentarily believe that your latest and greatest idea is worthy of a Nobel prize as  buoyant Jupiter pumps up the clever Gemini Moon. It's not that what you say is trivial; it's just that your perspective is out of whack today. Fortunately, you can effectively put the current planetary power to good use if you remember to integrate the cold hard facts into your plans. It's dangerous to ignore data just because it contradicts your position. Facing the truth isn't easy, but it's the only way to maintain your integrity."
cancer,2015-09-04,"Your desire for solitude clashes with your social obligations today. But even if you want to go solo, you might not be able to escape the endless conversations with those closest to you. You may even end up enjoying a very special camaraderie with your friends. The decision is yours, but thankfully, it's not an all-or-nothing choice. In fact, the negotiation process is more important than getting your needs met. Create an outcome where there are no winners or losers, so everyone feels heard. Communication is a two-way street."
leo,2015-09-04,"You can't wait to express your point of view to your associates today, but they might not be all that interested in what you have to say. You may fervently believe your perspective is worthy of top billing, but your arrogance can quickly turn others off. Cooperation is a much more productive model now than competition. Instead of shutting anyone out, listen closely to each person's ideas, since adapting to new information could make the difference between failure and success."
virgo,2015-09-04,"You normally excel when it comes to separating useful data from irrelevant information. However, pompous Jupiter can negatively influence your natural facility for wrapping up all the details today. Your thinking might grow sloppy if you're distracted by the plethora of possibilities in front of you now, especially if you concentrate on the overall generalities rather than the particulars. Keep your feet on the ground and use your common sense for the best possible outcome."
libra,2015-09-04,"You might surprise everyone today as you make snap decisions with uncharacteristic crystal clear vision. In fact, you are at the opposite end of the spectrum from wishy-washy now. Fortunately, you can take in the entire picture, but it's imperative to overcome the biggest potential pitfall. Be certain that you have all the facts at hand and not only those that support your position. Trusting your intuition is much more reliable when you start with the truth."
scorpio,2015-09-04,"Your ability to accomplish your objectives today is directly impacted by your thoughts, so stay  conscious of what runs through your mind. It's not that you can simply manifest everything you visualize with a snap of your fingers, but it just might feel that way now. However, your false sense of confidence is a trap. Even your best-laid plans quickly fall apart if you overextend your resources. On the other hand, you won't make much progress unless you reach beyond your normal limits. An extra push will be rewarded as long as you don't go too far."
sagittarius,2015-09-04,"Everyone seems to have the same diabolical purpose today: distracting you from your work. It's increasingly difficult to focus when there are so many compelling things calling your name. Your key planet Jupiter can be doggedly persuasive, encouraging you to talk your way through a challenging dilemma. Be forewarned; there is trickster coyote energy in the air and nothing is as it appears. If you over-inflate the balloon, it will surely pop."
capricorn,2015-09-04,"You may be offered an opportunity to conquer a tough challenge now by being completely objective about your current circumstances. If your ethics are based upon solid thinking, you will be able to build an empire you can be proud of. But your world might tear apart at the seams if you can't manage all the details. Integrity of data is crucial. Speak your truth and you can easily convince others to join you in your quest."
aquarius,2015-09-04,"Someone could present a wonderful idea to you today that seems too good to be true. But before you become more entangled in its energy, make sure to discuss all aspects of the plan with everyone involved. If you don't explore every angle, you might sadly discover you overlooked something obvious in your haste to jump on the bandwagon. Don't be foolish; there's no reason to rush in without proper analysis. Waiting may be the hardest part but it's also the smartest thing you can do now."
pisces,2015-09-04,"It appears as if the sky is clearing today, portending fair weather and smooth sailing ahead. Unfortunately, reality may fall short of your fantasies. Thankfully, you can create a perfect scenario within your imagination -- even if your dreams are totally unrealistic. However, it's wise to stick to your regular daily routine as much as possible now. You are in an excellent position to capitalize on your good fortune as long as you don't fall off the proverbial edge."
aries,2015-09-05,Nothing is more important to you today than living up to other people's expectations and you might even become obsessive about doing the right thing. Your drive to finish what you start is probably much stronger than your need to be distracted. You understand that you have no other option but to take care of unfinished business before you run out of time. There are deadlines to meet and your reputation is at stake; it's now or never.
taurus,2015-09-05,"Your emotional steadiness goes beyond a textbook description of a stubborn Bull. Romantic concerns that might normally be upsetting are taken in stride today because you believe you can safely say what's on your mind. However, you might have a sneaky suspicion that no one is listening to you. But don't rock the boat just to see if anyone is paying attention. Waiting for the right moment to have a rational discussion is less stressful for everyone involved and more effective in the long run."
gemini,2015-09-05,"You're confident you can communicate your ideas easily today, and you expect others to be charmed by your charisma. Although you may be poised to swing into action before you have all the details in place, your cavalier attitude clashes with a more contemplative side of your personality that comes to the forefront now. Assimilate your careful analysis into your strategy, for it helps you hit your target with even more accuracy. Practice makes perfect."
cancer,2015-09-05,"Your brain may win out over your heart in an internal struggle between logic and emotions. But it isn't wise to overreact to a situation before you allow sufficient time to process your feelings. It makes good sense to override a strong attraction that will only add drama to your life as long as you don't just shut down prematurely out of fear. Sometimes, the most loving thing you can do is to take care of yourself."
leo,2015-09-05,"It could seem as if you have reached the end of the road and that summer is already over, even though it's not. However, your anticipation of the future heightens your sense of urgency today as the Moon highlights your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes. You might try to squeeze so much into your schedule that you don't have time to enjoy any of it. Nevertheless, a more deliberate approach works if you stop and set priorities early in the day. Oddly enough, slowing down enables you to accomplish more than you ever dreamed possible."
virgo,2015-09-05,"You may be locked in an endless debate that has no clear winner as passionate Pluto aligns with the practical Virgo Sun today. Your words sound overly emotional, even if that's not how you feel. Although you might keep your vulnerability a secret for now, the truth will probably leak out soon enough, anyhow. Take control by shifting the conversation from a confrontational argument into an opportunity to share your passions. No one can find fault with your words as long as you communicate in a respectful manner."
libra,2015-09-05,"You wish you could lean on others now, but everyone seems to be on their own edge of change and therefore somewhat unavailable. Meanwhile, you can find balance as long as you keep your worries to yourself. Unfortunately, you may be living under an illusion based upon what you don't want to know. Nevertheless, it's easier to simply take care of a problem by responding quickly than it is to wait and see what will happen next if you leave things alone. Don't put off until tomorrow what can be done today."
scorpio,2015-09-05,"Don't quit now just because you're feeling overwhelmed. Have faith that you can get through all your assignments if you simply focus on one task at a time. However, all kinds of distractions pull you away from your mundane commitments. Fortunately, the Sun's trine to persistent Pluto blesses you with the ability to maintain your concentration, no matter what. You can reach your desired destination if you put your mind to it. Where there's a will, there's a way."
sagittarius,2015-09-05,"Although your enthusiastic nature can often move mountains, optimism alone isn't enough to prepare you for the big changes ahead. Don't try to fake competence or you could find yourself in over your head before you know it. You must clearly demonstrate your competence before you ask others to accept you as their leader. Your passion is inspirational but all talk and no action won't get you very far today. Lead by example and not by command."
capricorn,2015-09-05,"There's so much uncontrollable energy floating around in the atmosphere today that you might not be able to suppress your current anxiety. However, you won't find peace of mind by trying to run the entire show. Being in touch with your feelings isn't necessarily a problem, especially if it motivates you to exert your authority over those parts of your life that are within your sphere of influence. But don't fight an unwinnable battle; knowing when to let go can turn potential frustration into surprising satisfaction."
aquarius,2015-09-05,"If there are lingering questions from a close friend or partner hanging between you, respond to them as fast as possible because your window of opportunity is closing quickly now. Instead of secretively manipulating the pieces of the puzzle, bring any remaining concerns out in the open while you can. Once all your cards are on the table today, it will be much easier to talk about what is wrong and discuss a variety of possible solutions. Clearing the air is the kindest thing you can do for all parties involved."
pisces,2015-09-05,"Stand up and say what's on your mind today because your words carry the intensity of the conviction of your beliefs. Go the extra mile to be completely honest with your friends while the Sun harmonizes with profound Pluto in your 11th House of Social Networking. Just be certain you're making sense when you share your feelings, since you could be extremely passionate about a relationship issue now. Aim your thoughts carefully and don't stray from your truth. Claim your power while you have the chance."
aries,2015-09-06,"It feels as if you have one last chance to revisit your childhood to salvage something meaningful you left behind. Perhaps you set aside some artistic pursuit or creative pastime as you grew up and were told to be more responsible. Surprisingly, resurrecting an old hobby can bring a deep sense of emotional fulfillment no matter how many years have gone by. True expressions of the soul are not bound by time, space or matter."
taurus,2015-09-06,"You know that you should be planning for your future now, however, you can't help but take one more stroll down Memory Lane to replay the good times you've shared with friends and family. However, the trick is to remember there are just as many wonderful experiences ahead. Instead of getting stuck in the past today, put your mind to creating special occasions with the ones you love in the present moment that will grow into future memories down the road. Gratitude is evergreen."
gemini,2015-09-06,"You want to spend time reliving the glory days but your past might not actually be as awesome as you remember it. You may have blown the events out of proportion over time, but they seem so real to you now. Nevertheless, you are eager to talk about your recollections and could even hope to reconnect with old friends from college or even your childhood pals. Reaching out to reminisce is a lovely diversion on a Sunday afternoon; pick up the phone and just say hello."
cancer,2015-09-06,"You still may be hooked on old tapes when it comes to receiving love and money. But you need to remember that's how you lived in the past. Now, as sweet Venus is turning direct, it's time to break habits that no longer serve you well. Focusing on your lack of resources does nothing to enhance your bank account. If you're always fretting about the scarcity in your life, you'll never feel the abundance around you. Prosperity starts as a state of mind."
leo,2015-09-06,"You have waited for this day long enough. Even though your life might not radically change today, it feels like the tables are finally turning in your direction. You can sense something different in the atmosphere, as if a weight has been lifted. However, you're not quite ready to put on your dancing shoes just yet; your emotions are sinking into more serious realms now as you ask important questions. But once you have your answers, you will be good to go."
virgo,2015-09-06,"Your ability to remain rational grows weaker when confronted by the emotions of someone who matters to your heart. Unfortunately, your recent sacrifices might have tilted the scales too far in another person's favor. Although gentle Venus is turning direct in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness, spiritual love may not be a satisfactory substitute for romantic love. Nevertheless, the emotional tides are shifting and your compassionate attitude could pay off with surprising results."
libra,2015-09-06,"You're standing on shaky ground today, and aren't so sure of your next move. Nevertheless, it's time to take the lessons you've learned over the past six weeks and put them to good use. Trusting your feelings to steer you in the right direction now gives you a chance to take a stand about something important. Although social alliances appear to be changing, your foundation is strongest when you speak from your heart."
scorpio,2015-09-06,"All this time you've been working in the dark and finally, you can see the light at the end of the tunnel. You have been applying yourself diligently without even a glimpse of the ultimate destination. But now, the horizon is growing visible through the lifting clouds and your anticipation grows by leaps and bounds. Share your dreams with others while magnetic Venus is attracting people of importance to your 10th House of Status. There's no reason to compromise your goals when you are so close to achieving them."
sagittarius,2015-09-06,"What seemed next-to-impossible just last week now seems highly likely. It's tempting to take people's stories at face value, especially when it's more fun to disregard the details and focus on the big picture today. However, you might think that heading out on your own would be a good idea until you remember how entangled your life is with everyone else's. Fortunately, you can pull off a major coup with just a little bit of luck and a lot of hard work. Cross your fingers and hope for the best."
capricorn,2015-09-06,"You're not typically all that comfortable letting others take care of you, but recently you spent a considerable amount of time reassessing your relationships. You can't help but notice how much others want to help you and it fills you with intense gratitude. Instead of seeing your vulnerability as a weakness, it's time to see it as a strength. Your reevaluation phase is over; accept support when offered -- emotional, physical or fiscal -- and return the favor when given a chance."
aquarius,2015-09-06,"You can see the love that's shining all around you where only recently you felt there was little to be found. Oddly enough, it's possible that nothing has changed -- except you and what your heart wants. Rehashing an old issue may be particularly cathartic now, especially if you go back to make amends. It's amazing how much healing can occur with just a simple apology. As Shakespeare wrote, ""A light heart lives long."""
pisces,2015-09-06,"You're ready to break old patterns that prevent you from experiencing love as fully as possible. You're tired of running into the same old ghosts that keep reappearing as long as you don't fully address your fears. Thankfully, your relationships take on a whole new vibration if you're willing to learn from your past mistakes. To err is human; to forgive is divine."
aries,2015-09-07,"You're not going to let anything bother you today, or so you think. Your swashbuckling strategy might actually work for a while, but it's unfeasible to maintain your cavalier attitude if someone's inconsiderate actions offend or threaten you. Even if you choose to ignore the sleight, addressing your unresolved feelings is less complicated now than if you wait until later. Being honest about your experience is better than letting an annoyance grow into resentment. Your reaction may ruffle someone's feathers, but expressing your emotions clears the air once and for all."
taurus,2015-09-07,"You're quite positive about your life's direction today and may even ignore a conflict in your calendar so you can maintain your current peace of mind. You're concerned that others will judge you unfairly, but it's impossible to bury your head in the sand while the introverted Cancer Moon squares chatty Mercury. It's healthier to face a potential problem in your schedule than to tap dance your way around it. Confront your fear of rejection; your dilemma is not as big as you think. You are most likely to find a solution when you open your heart and involve others in the process."
gemini,2015-09-07,"Although you might be tenaciously clinging to fears about your finances today, you could be putting on a show of confidence so others won't see past your charming demeanor. Wanting to present your life in a complimentary light is perfectly understandable, but don't try to fool yourself even if you are dazzling others with your fancy footwork. Managing your money needs to be a top priority. The only thing anyone needs to know is that you're busy and can't be disturbed now. The sooner you take care of business, the sooner you can have some fun."
cancer,2015-09-07,"You seem rather distracted today, yet it's wise to acknowledge your feelings and express your needs while the evocative Moon is back in your sign. You're beginning a whole new emotional cycle now, yet your attachment to the past prevents you from fully embracing the future. Patience is one of your strengths; just don't turn it into an exercise in procrastination while waiting for the most propitious moment to act. Reveal your heart while the planets are in your corner and Lady Luck is on your side."
leo,2015-09-07,"You may appear to be quite agreeable in all that you do today, but you still have your own agenda cooking on the back-burner, nonetheless. Instead of trying to persuade anyone that you're onto something big, you might choose to simply hide your true intentions from others now that the reflective Moon is lurking in your 12th House of Privacy. The fact is there's no need to explain your decisions; your actions speak louder than any words you might use to rationalize your behavior. The element of surprise is your secret weapon."
virgo,2015-09-07,"Everyone seems to be relying on you for something today and you don't want to let anyone down. Although various commitments are pulling you in many directions, you desperately want to narrow your focus and do one thing at a time. You have high expectations for the quality of your experiences, but find it impossible to relax when you're under too much pressure. Perfection is not required; establish a new agenda that permits you to slow down and fully enjoy your time with friends and family."
libra,2015-09-07,"You might not be as emotionally available as others expect these days, but you're doing significant work within the confines of your mind. Do the best you can to maintain appearances to give yourself the room you need to continue your inner journey. Remember, today's creative ideas fuel your intentions for the days ahead. Set boundaries if people keep interrupting your reverie; getting lost in your imagination now helps you find the keys to your future success."
scorpio,2015-09-07,"Your desire to support someone else's plan doesn't mean you have to relinquish your own dreams. Unfortunately, you may feel pushed into an uncomfortable emotional box if you believe that people are taking unfair advantage of your flexibility. Try not to blame anyone for their shortcomings; just focus on your own reactions instead of what others did or didn't do. Adopting a compassionate strategy allows for the best possible outcome for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2015-09-07,"An intense relationship issue with a powerful person may turn into an outright conflict today as clashing points of view demand your intervention. Nevertheless, direct confrontation won't produce a clear winner now, so minimize unnecessary drama by refusing to cross swords or words with anyone. Instead of wasting precious time arguing about who is right and who is wrong, explore common ground so you can accomplish more than either of you could on your own. Take the high road and see who follows."
capricorn,2015-09-07,"You're as busy as a beaver today and happy that you have a variety of things to do on a day off. Nevertheless, you're not thrilled if people are overly dependent on you. You don't like running all over the place to bail out others when you secretly wish you were addressing your own needs. Although you can't ignore your personal relationships, you can reshuffle your priorities so that your goals take precedence. Being clear about your desires from the start prevents anyone from having unrealistic expectations. Standing up for yourself inspires others to do the same."
aquarius,2015-09-07,"Crosscurrents at home require your undivided attention today. You're up for nearly anything and your positive attitude will ultimately hold you in good stead. But your eagerness could set up an unhappy situation where you are stretched so thin that you cannot enjoy yourself, no matter what you're doing. Stay aware of your energy level so you can maintain a sustainable pace and, ultimately, feel satisfied at the end of the day."
pisces,2015-09-07,"A relationship dilemma may be interfering with your ability to laugh while everyone else around you is busy having fun. Or perhaps your emotional needs are in conflict with your current social obligations. Either way, you must find a sensible course of action that allows you to remain in touch with your feelings without believing that you must fix everything right away. Resolution will come in time if you don't try too hard to play the hero now. A willing heart and a healthy sense of humor are all you need to bring to the table today."
aries,2015-09-08,"Sparks are flying and you are energized by the electric buzz in the atmosphere. Irrepressible Uranus zaps your key planet Mars today, provoking you to act on your feelings without restraint. However, you're likely to have transitory moments of self-doubt interspersed throughout the day. Rest assured you will bounce back each time, so make the most of your enthusiasm when it returns. Your passion for life is contagious, but others will be more supportive of your spirited approach if you remember to respect their boundaries in the process of chasing your dreams."
taurus,2015-09-08,"There's a lot going on today but you don't want to be pulled off course. It's all too easy to be swept up in distractions with so much planetary energy reverberating around you now, leading you to misplace your wallet or skip an appointment. You might try to run away from all the commotion because too much instability makes you nervous. Nevertheless, you don't need to ignore reality to find happiness. Let your inner composure act as your guide as you calmly navigate the outer chaos of the day."
gemini,2015-09-08,"Everyone seems to be having a good time today and you long to be a part of the action. You're ready for the show as long as you can share the stage with people you respect. You don't want all the attention because you know that responsibility comes along with performing the lead in a production. Nevertheless, you would like your magical moment in the spotlight. Luckily, your charm works in your favor now as long as you don't lay it on too thick. Ultimately, the best role you can play is your authentic self."
cancer,2015-09-08,"You may seem overly moody to others today, especially if you're oblivious to their perceptions. Although the reflective Moon is swimming through your sign, you don't have time to contemplate your emotions when there's a lot at stake at work. You are overwhelmed with so many tasks to do that you can't sit still. Setting clear intentions right from the start empowers you to maintain your direction in spite of the hustle and bustle of the day. Fixating on your goals anchors you even when circumstances keep changing all around you."
leo,2015-09-08,"Your actions tell the most convincing story today. In spite of all your inspirational talk, you're happy to fly solo now. You're not willing to go along with the group consensus, but your agenda is so brilliant that people may choose to follow you, instead. Unfortunately, you're moving so fast that you appear as a blur to those who might select you as their leader. Nevertheless, your independent attitude isn't necessarily in your best interest. When you work as part of a successful team, the whole is more than the sum of its parts."
virgo,2015-09-08,"There's a lot of energy wafting through your world these days and it needs a positive direction to prevent it from bottling up. Luckily, you are in touch with your feelings and are certain about your destination. Nevertheless, you may need to make mid-course corrections throughout the day when you encounter unexpected twists and turns on your path. Fortunately, the element of surprise works to your advantage now if you don't resist the changes. You can easily exceed your own expectations if you're willing to meet reality halfway."
libra,2015-09-08,"You're not in the mood to put up with any nonsense today. Your emotional fuse is short and your reaction to someone's shortcomings could be swift. However, your impatience with a friend or coworker might actually be a result of your own frustration. Expressing what's on your mind may feel cathartic in the moment, but could create major disruptions to your routine. Decide in advance if your outburst will be worth it. Not every thought or feeling needs to be shared. Channel your angst into your creativity and there will be less collateral damage to regret."
scorpio,2015-09-08,"You might be running circles around everyone at work today. Your nerves are on edge and your energy is indefatigable. However, something may be quietly gnawing away at your confidence from a dark corner in the recesses of your mind. This negativity can be a momentary passing thought if you're willing to be proactive in your thinking. Once you know the source of your self-doubt, you can quickly move past it and reclaim your position as the unchallenged king of the mountain."
sagittarius,2015-09-08,"Your current creativity is a sight to behold because it appears as if you are freely living your dreams. You Archers have sprouted wings and are riding high on the planetary thermals as inventive Uranus trines energetic Mars in your 9th House of Distant Horizons. However, unbeknownst to others, your emotions are anchored to a stable point on the ground, blessing you with the ability to soar without losing touch with reality. Balancing between reckless abandon and cautious responsibility empowers you to reach further into the future than ever before. Fly, baby, fly!"
capricorn,2015-09-08,"Your penchant for serious thinking won't stop you from joining in the fun and games today. Even if you are tempted to act in an authoritative manner, you can't play the role of a heavyweight for long when your spirit feels so light and free. Partaking in the pleasures of the day is more beneficial to you in the long run than striving to achieve another goal. Sometimes a  Mountain Goat just wants to act like Pan, spontaneously singing and frolicking on the edge of a cliff without a care in the world."
aquarius,2015-09-08,"You're eager to show off your wild and quirky side today and people can't decide if you're brilliant or crazy. Thankfully, your actions are inspired by a higher power that encourages you to go right to the edge of acceptability without stepping over it. Don't cling to old patterns; trusting your instincts now won't steer you wrong while warrior Mars harmonizes with ingenious Uranus. You possess the magic to make anything happen as long as you believe in the impossible."
pisces,2015-09-08,"Your current understanding of your place in the world is in the midst of major upheaval as spontaneous Mars trines unpredictable Uranus in your 2nd House of Values. So much is happening so fast that there's no way you can maintain the status quo. Fortunately, you're so busy anticipating the future that you're not experiencing any feelings of fear or uncertainty. However, you may be like a fish out of water now; luckily, integrating the changes with a spiritual slant allows you to walk on solid ground like a pro."
aries,2015-09-09,"You wake up wired for action, feeling jolts of intellectual lightning that won't let you go back to sleep. This mental adrenaline rush makes it nearly impossible to moderate your message today. Fortunately, you're so connected to your spiritual path now that your passionate nature can be quite inspiring to others. Nevertheless, you could become your own worst enemy if you are convinced that your way is the only route to success. Focus on projecting the positive potential without trying to prove your superiority. All roads lead to Rome."
taurus,2015-09-09,"Your plans seem to make perfect sense today as long as you don't attempt to explain them to your coworkers. Naturally, this silence can become a real problem, especially if your approach is more radical than everyone else's. You're willing to break a rule or two in order to achieve success while the rebellious Mars-Uranus trine is in the picture, but perhaps a close friend is urging you to take an even greater risk now. Obviously, you respect the opinions of those you love but, ultimately, your heart knows what's right for you."
gemini,2015-09-09,"Your insatiable curiosity may play a role in a complicated scenario today because you're unwilling to accept the party line as a rational answer to your questions. Unfortunately, you could run into trouble if a tough opponent decides you're the source of the quandary now. Don't waste your energy trying to convince others to support your out-of-the-box ideas. Instead, concentrate on your most immediate goal and don't let up until you see real progress. Knowing what to do in the long run is much easier when your priorities are in order and your mind is clear."
cancer,2015-09-09,"You know in your heart you're about to do something outrageous that frightens you as much as it excites you. Sometimes taking a risk, even a calculated one, provokes angst. However, you might slip through this portal without concern because your unorthodox behavior is receiving cosmic assistance now from the brilliant Mars-Uranus trine. Nevertheless, you still have to speak up and let the universe know what you want. You're more likely to get exactly what you need if you boldly take the initiate; he who hesitates is lost."
leo,2015-09-09,"You need to be acknowledged at work today and you won't take silence for an answer. Oddly enough, you might feel very secure on the job now, even if you're actually living close to the edge. You may be optimistic about your current trajectory, but your entire plan could backfire if you pressure others with your unconventional ideas. Explain your strategy objectively and then wait to see how everyone reacts before doing anything drastic. Integrating the valuable feedback you receive makes all the difference in the world."
virgo,2015-09-09,"You can't keep quiet about your fears now, even if you think your disclosure will only make you more vulnerable. Fortunately, revealing your feelings allows others to see you in a more human light. Once you soften enough to let someone comfort you, your apprehensions may disperse on their own. In fact, your preemptive strike could be enough to prevent the situation that you previously thought was inevitable. Sharing your concerns with a trustworthy friend calms your nerves. Sometimes a supportive shoulder is all you need to regain your confidence."
libra,2015-09-09,"You prefer to be a busy bee today, yet you also might grow weary of pollinating so many flowers. But burning up all of your energy early in the day means you won't have the creative juice later when you really need it. You have nothing to prove to anyone else; instead of panicking because you think you're being judged, take control of your day and set your own pace. When you aim for a distant target now, you become the master of your own destiny."
scorpio,2015-09-09,"You feel a thrilling electrical current when you flirt with the edge, whether you are skydiving, starting a new job or ending a stale relationship. Ignoring your impulses is nearly impossible while sexy Mars trines shocking Uranus, driving you to try something you've never done before. Watch out for the point of no return today; you can't change your mind once you step past it. Remember the moral of the Hansel and Gretel fairy tale: no matter how many bread crumbs you leave for a trail, it isn't always possible to find your way back home."
sagittarius,2015-09-09,"Your friends may encourage you to do something that's good for your heart and soul. Naturally, you don't need too much convincing to escape your routine, but the point isn't to avoid your responsibilities in the process. Instead, just be adaptable enough to pursue a bit of unscheduled fun in your day. Taking a spontaneous break might be just what the doctor ordered, but it could also raise some eyebrows at work. Don't surprise anyone with your sudden exit; explaining your actions in advance reduces the tension before it has a chance to gain traction. Accountability matters."
capricorn,2015-09-09,"You have a number of projects to complete this week and a strategic plan to reach your goals. However, your day won't likely play out according to your expectations. There are too many unknown variables that require you to go along with the ambiguity or you may have a rough time fitting in with others at work. Nevertheless, remaining open to last-minute changes might quickly turn a frustrating day into one filled with anticipation and excitement. The same external events can either make you crazy or happy; the choice is yours."
aquarius,2015-09-09,"It's all too easy to justify your current behavior as the expressive Leo Moon performs in your 6th House of Daily Routine. Nevertheless, you have important decisions to make now, freeing you to shift gears and leave your past behind. Don't engage in endless conversations that go nowhere today. Pay close attention to the sensations in your body and do what feels best. Although others might not like your choices, the intelligence of your heart won't lead you astray."
pisces,2015-09-09,"You might think you intuitively know what people want before they ask for it. Still, it's wiser to wait until others articulate their needs today, instead of making matters worse by jumping to an incorrect conclusion. It can be disheartening if a coworker says no to your suggestion, even if it's apparent that he or she lacks vision. But fretting about a stressful situation is simply a waste of your talents. Let the energy sit and see how everyone feels in a few days. There's no hurry if your heart is in the right place."
aries,2015-09-10,"The clock is ticking and there are only so many hours in the day. No matter how hard you push, your progress might appear to grind to a halt today. But don't worry because everything is likely still on course. Success is just going to take a little longer than you originally expected. Use the extra time to review your plans and fine-tune them however you can. Ultimately, your additional preparation makes you even more productive when the pace picks up in the days ahead."
taurus,2015-09-10,"Your big plans for the future might seem daunting now as you think about how long it will take to reach your destination. You are fully committed to succeeding in your endeavors, but need to apply yourself more diligently than you ever imagined. Although it sounds counter-intuitive, find time to kick back and chill today while you still have the chance. You may be happily surprised how much a little rest and relaxation revitalizes your attitude and lifts your spirits."
gemini,2015-09-10,"Your life may resemble a three-ring circus these days but that's typically how you like it. Nevertheless, the Moon's hyperactivity in your 3rd House of Distractions might be a bit too much noise, even for you. Your juggling act looks like a lot of fun until you don't complete your work in a timely manner, tumbling your illusory house of cards. Luckily, even a minor setback could ultimately work in your favor if you take the changes in stride. A true professional knows the show must go on."
cancer,2015-09-10,"You recently made a promise that you thought was beneficial for your career but you might begin to doubt your own wisdom today. Nevertheless, you're willing to follow through with your commitments, even if you're not as certain about the outcome. Fortunately, your tentative nature serves you well if you take time to consider alternatives now. You might happily discover a better way to reach your destination or you will be more self-assured as you continue on your chosen path. In either case, stretching your horizons and exploring all your options makes good sense when it comes to professional matters."
leo,2015-09-10,"Life seems like an exciting jousting tournament today and you're anxious for the match to begin. Unfortunately, the rules of engagement aren't necessarily clear and your opponent hasn't even been identified. It's like you're Don Quixote, ready to fight figments of your imagination. But you don't have to create problems where there are none. Instead of seeing reality as something to defeat, channel your aggression into manifesting a more positive future."
virgo,2015-09-10,"You aren't as interested in getting everything perfect as you are in having fun today. However, you don't want anyone to know that you're willing to compromise your work ethic for the opportunity to take a walk on the wild side. Luckily, your chances of pulling off a little escapade are supported by a rebellious Moon-Uranus trine while the emphasis on your 12th House of Privacy provides you with an invisibility cloak. The key to winning your freedom now is to fly under the radar while chasing your dreams."
libra,2015-09-10,"You may be unnecessarily self-critical now because you want to make the best impression possible on your associates. You are willing to put in extra hours today if you believe your actions will demonstrate your cooperative attitude. No matter how admirable your intentions are, there's a limit to what you can do. Treat the current situation at work like a game of chess; contemplating your next move is a smarter strategy than simply reacting spontaneously. In the meantime, cut yourself some slack. As the Dalai Lama said, ""Love is the absence of judgment."""
scorpio,2015-09-10,"Although your professional trajectory might look good on paper now, sticking with your plan may be more challenging than you anticipated. Thankfully, you're not as concerned with the immediate events as you are with your long-term objectives. Of course, it's wise to apply your wisdom and experience to whatever is occurring in the present moment. However, you may have to make some adjustments in how you approach your work. Consider your current situation as a work in progress; the good news is everything doesn't have to be finished in one day."
sagittarius,2015-09-10,"Your current exuberance is off the charts; you see unobstructed horizons every which way you look. It feels as if nothing can stop you now. However, your exhilaration is a mixed blessing because you may be so confident that you don't pay attention to the obvious clues. You might even believe that the rules of the road are made for everyone except you. Instead of courting disaster through denial, improve your game by embracing self-imposed limitations. Judicious use of the brakes ensures a safe journey."
capricorn,2015-09-10,"A highly energetic person may have a lot to offer you today, but there's an emotional price to be paid when working closely with anyone else. Ironically, it's exceptionally tricky to engage in a mutually beneficial partnership when everything appears so good at first glance. Fortunately, your joint efforts will likely be rewarded, but only if you work out your differences before you start. Taking time to build a solid foundation makes for a relationship of lasting value."
aquarius,2015-09-10,"Relying on your closest friends may lead you in the right direction today, but their advice might shock you. Don't expect others to sugarcoat their words now that the Moon is resonating with reactionary Uranus in your 3rd House of Communication. Embrace the current reality check as gracefully as possible; anything that isn't working should be set aside. Rather than wasting energy on an outdated plan, use what you learn to create a brilliant new strategy that carries you far into the future."
pisces,2015-09-10,"You thought you had a clear picture of the future, but unexpected events on the job bring hidden new vistas into view. It's been increasingly difficult to separate your fantasies from objective reality, but you're prepared to do whatever detective work is required to get to the truth. Take advantage of today's temporary clearing as the clouds of illusion vanish from the sky. Share your plans with someone you respect because a meaningful conversation could be the catalyst that changes everything."
aries,2015-09-11,"Someone may perform such a convincing dog and pony show today that you're ready to drop everything and join the cause. However, don't sign on any dotted lines until you run through all the numbers and verify all the facts. Luckily, taking the time to do a proper analysis will quickly highlight any potential trouble spots with the story. Exercise caution and utilize your common sense, even if everything sounds amazing. Small steps forward are better than none at all."
taurus,2015-09-11,"You are still caught in a personal struggle, trying to find a happy balance between work and play. However, you may be more interested in planning your weekend activities now than fulfilling your obligations. Unfortunately, you can't sneak away to the beach today because your coworkers won't let you forget about your responsibilities. Instead of fantasizing about your escape, change your attitude and focus on what's right in front of you. The secret of  happiness can be found while you're busy counting your blessings and making the most out of every day."
gemini,2015-09-11,"You don't know how much longer you can hold out as you sit on the edge of your seat wishing for a bit of rest and relaxation. Although you try to rationalize your behavior today, the more you explain your intentions, the less people understand you. Naturally, it's a bit disconcerting when your words don't clearly communicate what's on your mind. Nevertheless, your silence can say more than you realize, especially if your actions are aligned with your heart."
cancer,2015-09-11,"It seems as if you're lingering in a dream state and have lost all sense of time. Frustration arises if your progress in the real world comes to a standstill. However, your current disorientation is just a temporary illusion caused by your mind playing tricks on you. Continue fine-tuning your plans while you still have time; your current efforts will pay off in the future. Remember, the longer you wait for something, the more you will appreciate it when it arrives. If you can imagine it, you can make it real."
leo,2015-09-11,"You're willing to try nearly anything to make the day fly by quicker because you're eager to return to your nest. You might even be in the mood to make some home improvements or acquire new furnishings this weekend. However, it's wise to weigh your needs against your cash flow before you start spending like there's no tomorrow. Watch your bank account or a domestic project could jeopardize your fiscal stability. If you want to feel rich, just count all the things you have that money can't buy."
virgo,2015-09-11,"You may be entangled in a complicated relationship situation today. On one hand, you feel emotionally available and are open to sharing your feelings with someone close to you. On the other hand, your words say one thing while your actions reveal a different story. Avoid overcompensating to defend yourself against imaginary adversaries, since you might not be seeing things as clearly as you think now. Your perspective will straighten out on its own, but it could take a few days. In the meantime, have faith; the path to love will appear once you know what your heart wants."
libra,2015-09-11,"Your well-kept secret or someone else's hidden agenda can have a strong influence on the dynamics of your day. Unfortunately, it may be quite challenging to put all the pieces together and make sense out of the current circumstances. After all, significant information is still missing and you're playing along without knowing the rules of the game. Paradoxically, sinking into the mystery might be the best way to coax the facts out into the open. Only time will tell."
scorpio,2015-09-11,"You are naturally quite picky about whom you rub elbows with, but your growing circle of friends is still a significant part of your world. You may want to retreat from the crowd today to establish healthy boundaries, but don't disappear too fast because you're likely to receive intangible benefits from just hanging out with your peers. To paraphrase John Lennon, ""You can get by with a little help from your friends."""
sagittarius,2015-09-11,"The spotlight is shining on your career now as your concern for your workmates creates an open environment which is more fulfilling for everyone. Reexamine the obstacles that stand in the way of your success, but remember that the resistance is as much within your head and heart as it is anywhere else. Acknowledging your fears is the first step to overcoming them. Being honest about your feelings sets a positive tone for the entire group."
capricorn,2015-09-11,"You continue to do your best at meeting your professional expectations, but you might wonder now why you try so hard. You're less concerned with your day-to-day obligations and more inspired by long-range planning. Nevertheless, problems may still arise if you let important details slip. There's little allowance for slacking today so don't get caught dawdling at the water cooler. A lazy day could cost you more than you realize so buckle up and get to work."
aquarius,2015-09-11,"You may be lured into a complex emotional drama today and it could interfere with your productivity at work. Your performance might suffer if you are captivated by a spiritual philosophy, a metaphysical topic or an unconventional idea. However, you can glide your way through the unfolding circumstances as long as you maintain clarity about your priorities. Ultimately, it's not about having time; it's about making time for the things that matter."
pisces,2015-09-11,"A friend or coworker could wind up on your doorstep and present a problem to you as if it were yours alone to solve. This unfair request may stir up your anger, making it difficult to express your feelings openly. Thankfully, there's probably an easy-to-find resolution for nearly any potential conflict now, even if there seems to be no immediate solution. It's not disagreement that keeps people apart; it's a lack of communication. Compassionate dialogue is the key that unlocks nearly any puzzle."
aries,2015-09-12,"Your senses are on high alert and your acute perceptions register every single nuance in your immediate environment today. Unfortunately, you may be so receptive to other people's feelings now that you start noticing things that aren't actually there. Be careful with your pronouncements about what is real; you might be fabricating stories to justify what's in your imagination without even realizing it. Asking lots of questions is better than making faulty assumptions that lead to nothing but trouble."
taurus,2015-09-12,"Everyone seems to be out of step while you are marching along to the beat of a very reliable drummer today. The Sun and Moon are walking hand in hand through fellow earth sign Virgo, supporting your efforts to maintain a steady pace. However, a few unexpected events could rattle your rhythm. Be gentle with yourself because you can easily grow anxious if you try to perform your work at record speed. There's really no need to rush; rely on your sense of humor to save the day."
gemini,2015-09-12,"You think you're ahead of the game only to discover that you somehow outsmarted yourself as trickster Mercury makes his presence known. There's no need to let your inquisitive nature tempt you to look for problems that haven't even surfaced when there is so much positive potential in front of you. Your mental agility is your strong suit, but it's more useful now to just stick with your original plan. Although counting your chickens before they hatch isn't wise, neither is letting negativity hijack your day."
cancer,2015-09-12,"Tinkering with your calendar one more time still won't enable you to fit everything into your day. You need to face the facts and decide what to eliminate before it's too late. Unfortunately, talking about your current time crunch may be a lot easier than actually resolving it. Nevertheless, you will feel a sense of welcome relief after you postpone a few things on your schedule. Setting limits is the kindest thing you can do for everyone involved."
leo,2015-09-12,"You might feel a loss of momentum today as you readdress issues of financial security. Although you're eager to replenish your reserves, it will take longer than you think to put your finances back in order. Spring into action if you don't want your concerns about money to be more problematic in the weeks ahead. Remember, there's no need to spend what you don't have just to keep up appearances. Getting back to basics is the first step to reclaiming solid ground."
virgo,2015-09-12,"You're struggling with balancing two divergent approaches to life today. On one hand, the Moon, the Sun and Jupiter conspire in your discerning sign, inspiring you to singularly focus your intentions on your work. On the other hand, wildcard Uranus could change the rules of the game in a blink of an eye. Thankfully, you can manage the volatility by instinctively reacting in the present moment and sorting through the details later on. Don't waste time trying to figure out what's right; the answers will come to you organically on their own."
libra,2015-09-12,"It feels as if people are pressuring you to participate in a group activity today, but you're not feeling very social. Normally, you're the neighborly one who seeks out the company of friends; however, the loud planetary noise in your 12th House of Privacy prompts you to run for the nearest cave. People might not understand your current need for solitude, but the secret to your happiness may be found by spending time in seclusion now rather than in the public eye. It's easy to lose yourself in a crowd; it takes true courage to stand alone."
scorpio,2015-09-12,"You need to set aside a chunk of time for a serious relationship discussion with a close friend or partner today. Nevertheless, you're not interested in revisiting an old issue now because you really want to create forward movement. Unfortunately, you may feel as if you're stuck in an energetic holding pattern. Don't let your unspoken feelings fester; talking about them might not bring resolution, but it certainly starts the ball rolling. Communication is the glue of any relationship; without it, you're simply two people dancing in the dark."
sagittarius,2015-09-12,"You're happily racing ahead on the road of life today, but could be careening toward an unexpected roadblock in the distance. You might even be required to suddenly change directions if you're not willing to stop and reassess your motives. Although there's no need to finalize your new destination, the sooner you begin discussing your lingering fears with someone you trust, the quicker you'll be able to regain a clear perspective. Count on your resiliency; you can't keep a good Centaur down for long."
capricorn,2015-09-12,"You may be very thankful that you have a concrete plan in place now, even if it will take considerable time to put it into motion. You're eager to dig in your heels and get serious about reaching your goals. Luckily, you excel at strategic calculations when it comes to obtaining what you want, especially if long-range ambitions are on the agenda. Nevertheless, gaining control of the details of your day will actually help you regain mastery over your entire life."
aquarius,2015-09-12,"You have magic at your fingertips today whether you realize it or not. However, this cosmic gift is not meant to be used for personal benefit. Answers are more likely to appear in your dreams now instead of rational logic, so don't seek solutions to global problems through the usual channels. Although your thoughts might mislead you, images won't. Employing symbolic gestures can strongly impact the outcome of your spiritual work in a positive manner. Live the Aquarian dream and use your superpowers to help the world be a better place."
pisces,2015-09-12,"A significant relationship may fall short of your expectations now, especially if you believe your partner is being excessively critical. It might seem as if he or she is emotionally distant and you don't have a clue why. Meanwhile, you long for deeper personal connections in your life while others seem to be less available for one reason or another. Although it's easy to get confused by all the missing pieces of the puzzle, your imagination holds the keys to the kingdom today and not your logic. Keep calm and follow your dreams."
aries,2015-09-13,"The tension is palpable today, distracting you with the anticipation of something dramatic that's about to occur. Although you can't push the feeling away, you're not ready to calmly accept your fate, either. Nevertheless, the Virgo Solar Eclipse rattles your 6th House of Logistics, reminding you that replaying a familiar old pattern does not allow you to progress on your journey of life. Embrace this opportunity to make the positives changes you've been dreaming of for too long. A rolling stone gathers no moss."
taurus,2015-09-13,"You can ride an impressive wave of creativity now if you simply concentrate on utilizing your talents. The Virgo New Moon Eclipse electrifies your 5th House of Play, reinvigorating your spirits and encouraging you to express yourself at any cost. However, focusing on the practical aspects of your day frees you to have more fun once you finish your chores. Paradoxically, the more you narrow your awareness, the better your chance of losing yourself in the spontaneity of the moment."
gemini,2015-09-13,"You may experience unexpected stress on the home front today, but luckily, you are wired to handle it with finesse. Whatever you do, keep the energy moving with the Virgo Solar Eclipse falling in your 4th House of Security. However, maintaining a smooth flow is a challenge, for worldly responsibilities pull you one way while your emotions and family dynamics pull another. You will probably be caught in the middle now, unless you do your famous Gemini shuffle. There's no need to choose between home and career; dance between the various parts of your life with a smile in your heart and a twinkle in your eye."
cancer,2015-09-13,You are stepping into a new phase of your life where what you say is extremely critical to your success. You're preoccupied with how to best get your message across as the exacting Virgo Solar Eclipse lands in your 3rd House of Communication. But tossing out a few well-chosen words won't do the trick unless you follow through by expressing your deeper emotions. Don't let your rational thoughts talk your heart out of what it wants.
leo,2015-09-13,"It is apparent to you that practice really does make perfect as today's Virgo New Moon Eclipse shakes up your 2nd House of Values. Luckily, you can successfully build on your previous efforts, but it will require ongoing determination on your part. Careful analysis before you do anything can make your actions count more later on. Move methodically and don't bite the bait that's dangling on the hook of immediate gratification. Proceed at your own pace; picking up steam will come naturally when the time is right."
virgo,2015-09-13,"You have reached a significant milestone that could remind you of all the hard work behind you as well as the challenges still in front of you. The Virgo Solar Eclipse accentuates your 1st House of Self, prompting you to attempt to make everything happen all at once. Needless to say, this ambitious tactic sets you up for failure. With visionary Jupiter blessing your sign now, you must strive for long-term completion rather than short-term satisfaction. Keeping your eyes on the distance prevents discouragement; your sustained efforts will earn you the accolades you seek, but only after you put in the work."
libra,2015-09-13,"It's crucial to keep all your dealings above board now, for an unspoken assumption can be your undoing. The slightest hint of shady dealings may cause your world to come tumbling down as the Virgo New Moon Eclipse triggers your 12th House of Destiny. Even while in the midst of a significant transition, you still must honor your core beliefs, for it is your integrity and your faith that will ultimately pull you through any challenge. Do what is right, not what is easy, if you want to walk on a spiritual path."
scorpio,2015-09-13,"Your social calendar may have filled up faster than you realized. Suddenly, it's obvious that you have way too much to do as the laser-like Virgo Solar Eclipse over-amps your 11th House of Community. It's probably too late to eliminate extraneous activities today, even if this sounds like the most intelligent strategy. Sometimes you just have to admit defeat and join the crowd. Surprisingly, you may end up learning something unusual, meeting someone influential or even opening a few doors of your own if you surrender to the idea of having fun."
sagittarius,2015-09-13,"Until quite recently you believed that your life was running on track, but you might start to question your direction when the Virgo New Moon Eclipse activates your 10th House of Career. It's challenging to have faith in your chosen path when your inner feelings don't seem to match up with your outer circumstances. But don't fret about the obstacles that prevent you from reaching your destination today. You may already be exactly where you're supposed to be without knowing it yet. Allow time for your head to catch up with your heart and for the universe to answer your prayers."
capricorn,2015-09-13,"Taking a conservative route may not get you as far as you wish today. The discriminating Virgo Solar Eclipse galvanizes your 9th House of Distant Horizons, urging you to pick one of your big ideas to pursue or they will all fade without so much as leaving a trace. Thankfully, you're capable of executing an exquisitely complex scenario now. So disregard the distractions, select your destination and shift into high gear. Be tenacious about your goals and flexible about your methods for the best results."
aquarius,2015-09-13,"An interpersonal drama might demand your undivided attention today, even if you try to remain cool, calm and collected. Your logical approach won't help you avoid the emotional pressure as the Virgo New Moon Eclipse zaps your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Although you may try to reason your way out of the situation at first, demonstrate your courage by exploring a new path to intimacy instead. Remember, flashy behavior is not as fulfilling as being true to your heart and making a real connection with someone you love."
pisces,2015-09-13,"The relationship issues that resurface now feel all too familiar because they won't disappear until you address them once and for all. It might seem as if the problem resides in people who are less than reliable as the Virgo Solar Eclipse destabilizes your 7th House of Companions. Unfortunately, there's little you can do to make anyone else take responsibility for their actions. However, you have your own rebellious nature to rein in before you ask others to do the same. Deal with your own idiosyncrasies; worrying about the rest of the world is just an easy distraction."
aries,2015-09-14,"You don't have to turn every conversation into a competition. In fact, this is a perfect day for you headstrong Rams to practice the art of compromise. The good news is that you are able to soften your hard edges now and let someone else run the show. Your uncharacteristic gentleness enables you to meet others halfway. In turn, your sensitivity minimizes unnecessary conflict. Nevertheless, don't give in too quickly or you'll end up settling for less than you deserve. As Buddha said, ""Those who are free of resentful thoughts surely find peace."""
taurus,2015-09-14,"Although you might dream about putting up your feet and relaxing today, you would likely grow bored and end up looking for something to do, anyhow. Luckily, with a little attitude adjustment you're able to adjust to the demands of the day and find pleasure from settling into your work while the Moon and Mercury are busy making hay in your 6th House of Daily Routine. You don't need to go searching the cosmos for anything special; the real magic is found in the most ordinary things you do now."
gemini,2015-09-14,"Your most demanding responsibilities may be placed on the back burner for a while today. But this temporary hiatus doesn't mean you can automatically avoid your obligations. Don't leave anyone in the dark when it comes to your work. Then again, the Libra Moon's equanimity indicates you don't need permission from anyone to deliver on your promises a little bit later than planned. Live in the moment; have yourself some good old-fashioned fun, but cover your bases before you run."
cancer,2015-09-14,"You might be required to make a decision that greatly affects your personal life while the diplomatic Libra Moon highlights your 4th House of Family. However, you would prefer to wait a bit longer to see how things develop before you announce your choice. Unfortunately, a difference of opinion could reach a boiling point sooner than you expect. Hiding your feelings won't work this time around. Crawl out of your protective shell and show your true colors, even if being honest feels like risky business."
leo,2015-09-14,"Your rational approach to a relationship dilemma can be your greatest asset now. Being fair and balanced actually requires some mental effort, but is well worth the trouble. The alternative is to rely on your charm to smooth things over, but this familiar strategy will likely leave you short of emotional satisfaction today. Making a list of pros and cons is a good place to start. Objectively sift through a variety of possibilities and then do your best to find common ground that's acceptable to all."
virgo,2015-09-14,"The same old methods won't necessarily work now, so you must find new ways to accomplish your goals. However, following your impulses might not take you in the right direction, so stop to take a few deep breaths before you switch gears. Even if you made your mind up yesterday, reviewing your decision is a prudent move. But you don't have time to wallow in self-doubt; pick a path and act with confidence as you proceed. If you believe in yourself, so will others."
libra,2015-09-14,"Although you may be extra moody with the evocative Moon lurking in your sign, you can still trust your feelings to tell the truth now. Even if you're planning on enjoying a peaceful day, you might also remember some deeper psychological issues that you have wrestled with before. Thankfully, you have a newly found hope for positive change. Use your natural instinct to fully consider both sides of a situation before choosing which one to support. Examining both your strengths and your weaknesses empowers you with the self-knowledge needed to win any battle."
scorpio,2015-09-14,"There is so much you're not saying today, but it's also possible you're unaware that something significant is missing from the picture. Unfortunately, what you don't notice now can come back and bite you later. Your most reliable defense is to consider all angles, including thinking about the unthinkable. Push all of your own buttons by exploring your fear of change. If you can face the dark alone, you might just realize that the unknown isn't as frightening as it seems from the distance."
sagittarius,2015-09-14,"You're not a stranger to the idea of living in the future, since you often aim your arrows of intention toward the next possible adventure. However, you need to cut your inflated ideas down to size today or you will surely encounter disappointment later on. Instead of dreaming about an unrealistic journey around the world, start planning a much less ambitious itinerary that you could actually manifest. Set an obtainable goal that will bring you joy rather than one that will remain sadly beyond your grasp."
capricorn,2015-09-14,"Your workload is stacking up faster than you can handle and the pressure is too intense for your liking. Escape sounds like a plausible idea, but you quickly realize your integrity won't permit you to quit until your job is done. Although you may feel as if you are in over your head, don't waste precious time entertaining the possibility of failure. You know exactly what must be done now, so bite the bullet and rise to the challenge. Every great accomplishment starts with a decision to try."
aquarius,2015-09-14,"You're on an emotional roller coaster and you can't find an easy way to jump off the ride. Thankfully, it's moving a bit slower today, yet there's still no opportunity for a graceful exit. You have serious work to finish now, so save your idle daydreaming for another day. But rather than letting your feelings hijack the day, channel your frustration into fueling your superhero efforts. It might seem as if you're facing a final exam, and perhaps you are metaphorically, but with dedication and perseverance you can pass this test with flying colors."
pisces,2015-09-14,"You have an important message to deliver today, but it's especially tricky to put your complex emotions into words. Ironically, you're just as impatient with someone for misunderstanding you as you are with yourself for not speaking clearly. The harder you try to make your point, the more confusion seems to mount. Watch the signs; if you're not connecting with others now, stop forcing the issue. Simply start up the conversation again tomorrow after everyone has had a chance to chill out. Don't take anyone's behavior personally when it is more about the timing than anything else."
aries,2015-09-15,"You can't escape from the consequences of someone's unexpected emotional outburst with the interdependent Libra Moon visiting your 7th House of Relationships now. You may be feeling particularly generous while energetic Mars supports your heroic efforts at putting others at ease. Nevertheless, you must also attend to your own needs today, or you won't have anything to give to anyone else. Being a more perfect partner is an admirable goal as long as you don't lose yourself in the process."
taurus,2015-09-15,"In theory, your straightforward strategy would make your workday more pleasant. However, in practice, you might be overwhelmed by all the details you must manage today. You can't hide your head in the sand because there is just too much going on now. Thankfully, you have a knack for simplifying the most complicated of circumstances with just a bit of resolve and common sense. Start by setting new priorities and you'll quickly regain your confidence after you eliminate some of the noise. Confucius said, ""The man who moves a mountain begins by carrying away small stones."""
gemini,2015-09-15,"The emotional web you are weaving may begin to unravel this morning, and your energy might feel as if it's tangled up in knots. However, you should be able to iron everything out once you navigate your way through these annoying challenges. The key is perseverance; the difficult spots will only grow if you try to avoid them. Acknowledging the presence of negativity is the first step to putting your life back in order. You can't change what you refuse to confront."
cancer,2015-09-15,"Unexpressed feelings at home complicate family dynamics in more ways than one. Separating your own feelings from those you love today can be tricky, even if you attempt to remain objective in your assessment of the situation. Contemplating your options makes sense, but dwelling on them is of no use. Don't hesitate to take action once you review the possibilities; you have a small window of opportunity now to make something wonderful happen. Speak your truth and let the universe take care of the rest."
leo,2015-09-15,"Your path into the future may seem clearly obvious, but a few distractions could obscure your way today. You might even feel as if others are acting out of desperation, trying to persuade you to set aside your plans in favor of theirs. Unfortunately, fighting for your cause won't solve anything; confrontation just escalates the tension. Don't stop to justify your actions. Sidestep the entire conflict by quietly doing your thing now instead of wasting energy in endless dialogue."
virgo,2015-09-15,"You might be caught off guard as a coworker or friend does something unexpected that derails your plans today. You may even feel emotionally abandoned now, even if no one has really left you. Keep in mind that times of great progress are often preceded by times of great chaos. Don't miss this opportunity to explore a whole new set of possibilities in response to the shifting landscape. Change is inevitable; growth is optional. Evolve while you have the chance."
libra,2015-09-15,"You're searching for a good excuse to change your mind now that the evocative Moon is hanging out in your ambivalent sign. Although you often skillfully employ logic to explain your waffling, objectivity isn't all that helpful today. It's your emotions that are currently fluctuating every few minutes. If you don't like what you're feeling in the moment, just patiently wait for the next wave until your moods begin to stabilize. There's no harm in floating for a while in the ebb and flow of your heart."
scorpio,2015-09-15,"You're trying to maintain a balanced perspective on your life, but there's only so much objectivity you can manage now. There are just too many variables to juggle these days, each adding subtle nuances to a delicate situation. You can make yourself crazy by attempting to untangle the threads of complexity. Or, you can turn up the volume on your daydreams and drift downstream for a while. Escape is an attractive alternative as long as you remember it's only temporary. Travel in your imagination today, solve your problems tomorrow."
sagittarius,2015-09-15,"You may feel an irrepressible urge to socialize with your friends today, partly because you're afraid you will miss out on the action. Although the idea of playing hooky is quite tempting, you can't just take the day off because it suits your fancy. Lucky Jupiter encourages you to believe that everything will work out fine, no matter what. But bailing on a commitment is not the right thing to do. Don't let blind optimism talk you out of being responsible. The choice is all yours, along with the consequences."
capricorn,2015-09-15,"Although you have partnership issues on your mind today, they're actually just mere distractions from the real dilemma at hand. Career decisions need to be made now that will have long-lasting ramifications. In fact, your current choices also have a significant impact on a spouse or companion. Thankfully, your emotions begin to settle down later in the day, revealing the most direct path to your goal. If you take the feelings of those you love into consideration you will be able to act from both your head and your heart."
aquarius,2015-09-15,"You are not the only one who thinks your adventurous ideas are pretty outrageous today. Although letting your imagination run wild could completely upset the apple cart, it might be worth the consequences anyhow. Set aside the restraints of logic and time while you explore all the alternatives without being attached to the outcome. Ultimately, you might not be able to take this particular dream trip, but giving yourself permission to fantasize may be enough of an escape for now."
pisces,2015-09-15,"Your restlessness may get the best of you today as you envision the numerous possibilities stretched out in front of you. Unfortunately, you are tied to your previously made commitments, so you can't just wander off the beaten path now. Instead, keep your eyes on the road and your feet on the ground. Honoring your priorities is a wise antidote to all the spacey energy coming your way. Delivering on your promises demonstrates the strength of your character and the integrity of your intentions."
aries,2015-09-16,"Nothing is gained by turning every molehill you encounter into a mountain. The problem is you're viewing the world through a magnifying lens that's set to high power, and even the tiniest details assume epic proportions now. Obviously, it's challenging to navigate a path when it's nearly impossible to discern which things are the most important. Remain open to what you learn from your intuition, but don't make any major decisions until you possess a sound analytical perspective on the current events."
taurus,2015-09-16,"You need to stretch a bit further to grab the wonderful opportunities for self-expression and personal growth that are calling your name now. However, you must be careful about wandering down the garden path with over-the-top expectations. Others may suggest ideas that sound perfect, but they might prove less beneficial once put into action. Wearing rose-colored glasses will only lead to disappointment today, especially when your impulses are running wild. Releasing any thoughts of a preconceived outcome empowers your inner child to come out and play."
gemini,2015-09-16,"Your home life may be a rich source of love and support as you present an image of abundance to your family. Regardless of the professional opportunities knocking at your door now, your personal life remains your top consideration. In fact, you might be contemplating the purchase of a new house or remodeling your current residence. In any event, keeping your priorities straight is wiser than just automatically saying yes to the next rung on the ladder of success."
cancer,2015-09-16,"Your circles of communication are growing as a new wave of fascinating people flows into your life. However, you may encounter significant resistance that originates from your own unexpressed fears. Luckily, your current optimism outweighs your nagging concerns. Your dreams of the future are fueling your desire to get it right in the present moment. Narrowing your focus might be difficult at first, but it's exactly what you need to do. Make new friends, but keep the old; one is silver, the other is gold."
leo,2015-09-16,"You are more determined than ever to acquire what you believe you deserve from life, but you might want to check yourself before you get your priorities twisted. Dreamy Neptune opposes excessive Jupiter in your 2nd House of Resources now, inflating the importance of money and material possessions. Nevertheless, the real significance of these worldly traps is not found in their dollar value, but in the good they can do for others. Happiness ultimately comes from the joy you spread when you share your abundance with those you love. Your generosity knows no bounds."
virgo,2015-09-16,"Relationships are your primary source of inspiration these days, but they may also be the cause of too much confusion. Most likely, you will experience some of both feelings today as ephemeral Neptune attracts the clouds of illusion and the mists of fantasy. Luckily, your penchant for personal growth can overcome even the murkiest of situations now. It's going to take more than a little fog to make you drop anchor. Where there's a will, there's a way; it might not be clear where you are going, but you'll get there, nonetheless."
libra,2015-09-16,"Big things are happening for you now, but not necessarily in the outer world where they can be seen. Your transformation is occurring in the spiritual and metaphysical dimensions, even if you're not consciously aware of it. Nevertheless, frustration about your lack of progress may set in if you're feeling lost at work. Don't worry; the very same lessons you are learning now will pay off in ways that you can't yet imagine. Roll the cosmic dice and see where they land."
scorpio,2015-09-16,Your path to emotional satisfaction is being paved in social realms now as working and playing with others take on a greater importance. But your current popularity can be slightly disorienting if your personal needs are subsumed by the agendas of those around you. Don't let the unknown rattle your confidence. Focus on the potential camaraderie you can experience today instead of worrying about your individual needs. The more the merrier; life's joys and sorrows are meant to be shared.
sagittarius,2015-09-16,"Do you know what it feels like when you're stopped at a traffic light and the car next to you has huge speakers with the bass turned up outrageously high? Everything shakes and reverberates, fraying your nerves and offending your ears. The volume on your life is so loud now that it may keep you from fully enjoying the goodies that are waiting on your doorstep. But you can't soundproof your life, so you might as well tap your foot to the beat of the music, even if you didn't choose the song. Life is what you make it."
capricorn,2015-09-16,"Your friends and coworkers don't know you as well as they think they do. Although they might see your industrious side, they're surprised with your current disinterest in racing to the top of the next summit. Nevertheless, you're more driven to explore the meaning of life now than to reach the next level of success. Thankfully, you don't need to sacrifice your worldly ambitions to pursue spiritual goals. Balancing the sacred with the mundane offers your soul true satisfaction."
aquarius,2015-09-16,"You are usually quite clearheaded about your direction, your values and your skills. However, it's more complicated to get a handle on your life now for reasons you can't fathom. Even if you stand directly in front of a full length mirror and gaze for a long time today, you're still not going to capture an accurate picture of who you are or what you are worth. Save the self-judgments for another day. When the universe invites you to dance, say yes now and ask questions later."
pisces,2015-09-16,"You will likely receive the help you want if you can overcome your insatiable need for perfection now. In fact, nearly all one-on-one encounters are already destined to be more fulfilling than normal. However, there is danger afoot; your imagination may be spinning out of control and it's tough to know which feelings to act on. If you come on too strong, your motives could be easily misinterpreted. Continue to search for that sweet spot as you work at separating your desires from the undisputed truth."
aries,2015-09-17,"People may have the best of intentions today, but their abrupt criticism can catalyze your thinking and set you off in a radical new direction. However, you must listen closely to what others say now because you could easily misinterpret something based on what you want to believe rather than what is actually said. Ask for clarification before you jump to any incorrect conclusions. You might hear a whole different story the second time around."
taurus,2015-09-17,"You suddenly realize today there's more work to do on a project that you thought was already finished long ago. If you glossed over what you believed was an insignificant detail, you may be required to go back and put things in order while Mercury is retrograde in your 6th House of Logistics. But seeking recognition for your extra efforts now will only bring frustration. Luckily, if you play your cards right, you'll get what you deserve later when you least expect it."
gemini,2015-09-17,"You could be ambivalent about romance as logical Mercury turns backward in your 5th House of Love and Play. One thing is for certain: you want to have fun, but you just don't know the best way to make it happen. Thankfully, it isn't necessary to figure everything out today; you're better off  making decisions on the fly now. All you need to do is maintain your optimism while remaining ready to change your plans on the spot. Living in the moment gives your creativity a chance to sprout wings."
cancer,2015-09-17,"Your personal life takes a surprising twist as an emotionally intense discussion morphs into a close encounter of some kind. It's nearly impossible to know how to define your interactions with others, for you could feel so detached from the drama now that you actually appear to be disinterested. Nevertheless, your curiosity may be enough to hook you on an issue while your tenacity helps to keep you in the game."
leo,2015-09-17,"Juggling all the appointments on your calendar can hijack your day as you are busy reestablishing connections with people in your social network. You are hopeful that they will support your latest cause, but you might feel let down if your expectations are too high. Remaining flexible now should help you  handle a series of unexpected complications with grace and charm. Leading with your sense of humor paves the way for more meaningful communication down the road."
virgo,2015-09-17,"Pay close attention to your key planet Mercury as he begins dancing backward in your 2nd House of Money today. You might try to compensate for your past indulgences by watching every penny you spend. But problems could stem from the littlest of errors now, rather than a significant budgetary crisis. If you recently have been remiss in paying your bills or sloppy when balancing your accounts, this would be the perfect time to get it right. A bit of due diligence on your part will have your financial house in order before you know it."
libra,2015-09-17,"You are particularly susceptible to the current retrograde of Mercury as he languishes in your ambiguous sign. You may start off a sentence with one idea in mind and finish it with another. Watch your words so you don't inadvertently offend someone you like with a half-baked opinion that slips out accidentally. No matter how profusely you apologize, you can't rewind the moment and take back what's already been said. If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
scorpio,2015-09-17,"You can quickly work yourself into an uncomfortable position where you must obstinately cling to an idea to prove your point. However, it's just as likely to be someone else who is the bullheaded one today. Don't draw conclusions before you have all the data you need or you might find yourself making an incorrect assumption which, naturally, will lead you to the wrong answer. If you can exercise patience and give everyone the benefit of the doubt, everything else will fall into place in its own sweet time."
sagittarius,2015-09-17,"Getting down to business today takes a healthy dose of self-discipline because there's too much commotion in the air to hear yourself think. Even your workmates seem to be wandering off the straight and narrow path, beckoning at you to join them. However, you can still be highly productive if you keep your mind singularly focused on your chores. If you do have the luxury of some downtime, don't be afraid to escape into a fantasy, a good book or a movie of your own choosing rather than following the crowd."
capricorn,2015-09-17,"Leading effectively is a challenging task when others aren't being completely honest with you. Your coworkers might intend to be forthright with their concerns now, but everyone is leery about what's not being said. No doubt, there is surely more going on than meets the eye today, but it's wise to give the process enough time to see where it's heading before you try to redirect it. Sometimes the best way to resolve a dilemma is to just leave it alone."
aquarius,2015-09-17,"It may be necessary to reassess your upcoming plans now that Mercury is dragging his heels in your 9th House of Philosophy. If you are longing to delve deeper into a cultural emergence, spiritual pursuit or artistic endeavor, this planetary ride has your name written all over it. There is no time to waste when there is so much to learn. Use the next few weeks to expand your horizons by exploring any ideas and activities that tweak your curiosity or tug at your soul."
pisces,2015-09-17,"Experiencing true intimacy becomes more elusive today as mischievous Mercury turns retrograde in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You're willing to climb out on an emotional limb and reveal a secret that makes you feel vulnerable. But don't struggle with the thought of not being heard if your heartfelt disclosure seems to fall on deaf ears. Those who love you will listen to your message and respond when they are ready. Patience, grasshopper; it takes time for the seed to grow into a flower."
aries,2015-09-18,"A change in the cosmic weather has you anticipating your future as industrious Saturn takes up residence in your 9th House of Distant Horizons. Although you may have been satisfied in the past with vague generalities when it comes to your goals in life, you are trying to make sense of what lies ahead and feel driven to establish a long-term plan now. If you have done your emotional homework and your personal relationships are in order, it's time to explore uncharted territory. Learning is no longer simply about satisfying your curiosity; instead, gather information as if it is a necessary tool for turning abstract ideas into concrete reality."
taurus,2015-09-18,"Your relationships have been the direct source of valuable lessons over the past couple of years. As strict Saturn gets comfortable in your 8th House of Transformation now, you must incorporate the knowledge you've acquired into your behavior so you can continue to evolve as an individual and a partner. Although the metamorphosis is gradual, you might have to delve into issues of your dependence when you can't count on anyone for financial and emotional support. Nevertheless, working within the current limitations fuels your personal growth; self-sufficiency builds strength of character."
gemini,2015-09-18,"Your closest associations become the grist for your mill as Saturn the Taskmaster methodically moves through your 7th House of Partnerships. People may seem more demanding these days, but it's only a reflection of your own need to raise the bar in all that you do. Interactions with others provide the stepping stones necessary for creating healthier relationships in your life. Deepening your own experience through one-to-one relationships empowers you to achieve more than you ever dreamed possible."
cancer,2015-09-18,"Sometimes, knowing what to do in life doesn't mean that you're always able to do it. As pragmatic Saturn puts down roots in your 6th House of Self-Improvement now, you must take all the information you've learned and put it into practice. Although there is still hard work ahead, the potential rewards are great if you start small and develop momentum gradually. Your vitality becomes an honest barometer of your overall well-being, signaling how well you're holding up under the pressures of your daily routine. Physical exercise is part of a larger disciplined regimen that assists you in reaching your potential; healthy habits elevate your game to a whole new level."
leo,2015-09-18,"Channeling your impressive creativity into activities that bring tangible results can change your entire life for the better. Serious Saturn's shift into your 5th House of Self-Expression demands that you tell the world that you mean business now when it comes to love and laughter. Although your interactions with children may inhibit your personal choices, they can also teach you how to embrace a more spontaneous approach to life. Free your mind and the joy will follow."
virgo,2015-09-18,"It may feel as if you're walking through a time warp now that past experiences meander their way back into the present moment. Your home and family life are cast in the spotlight as traditional Saturn travels through your 4th House of Roots. Although parental relationships -- with yours or your children -- can take on greater significance, this is your time to accept responsibility for your role in the bigger picture. Your most personal issues require your thoughtful attention; remember, you're setting the tone and direction for years to come, not only for yourself but also for those you love."
libra,2015-09-18,"It's crucial to say what you mean and to mean what you say while no-nonsense Saturn is journeying through your 3rd House of Communication. Even if you have been conscientious about your responsibilities over the past few years, you must begin making changes in your day-to-day activities that will eventually restructure your entire life. Instead of being discouraged by how far you must go to reach your long-term goals, focus on the little improvements you can make within the limitations of your current situation. Dream about the future but, as Ram Dass wrote, ""Be here now."""
scorpio,2015-09-18,"You may feel waves of relief and exhilaration wash over you as somber Saturn finally leaves your intense sign after an almost three-year visit. Although celebration might be a bit premature, the seeds of your future are officially planted now. Even if you're on a spiritual quest, keeping a close eye on your finances empowers you to function effectively in the mundane world. Saturn's current trek through your 2nd House of Resources requires you to re-prioritize your values and choose what you cherish the most as you take the next steps on your journey through life."
sagittarius,2015-09-18,"Your power of concentration is growing stronger day by day. Although your serious demeanor enables you to accomplish more than ever, it can be troublesome if you focus solely on limitations rather than potential. Saturn's return to your optimistic sign brings newly found maturity to how you manage your life, no matter how young or old you are chronologically. Karmic Saturn delivers what you earn so stop putting off the inevitable and get to work. You reap what you sow."
capricorn,2015-09-18,"You Mountain Goats are the champions of successfully making and executing long-term plans. You have the keen ability to calculate what you must do today in order to reach a specific goal tomorrow. However, your efforts are best put toward finishing up old projects now, rather than starting new ones. Hard-nosed Saturn's visit to your 12th House of Endings is an unambiguous message to clear the decks and eliminate baggage you no longer need. If you're traveling unencumbered, you will be freer to take advantage of the wonderful opportunities around the corner."
aquarius,2015-09-18,"Working cooperatively as a valuable member of a team sounds like a good idea to you friendly Aquarians, but your non-conformist tendencies can make you feel like an outsider. However, it's crucial to integrate your needs with those of the group as responsible Saturn sets up shop in your 11th House of Networking. Resistance is futile; coming to terms with your social obligations could make the difference between failure and success. Your mission is to maintain your individuality while working for the common good."
pisces,2015-09-18,"Your past work habits will either lead to great successes or unfortunate setbacks in the near future as stern Saturn calls the shots in your 10th House of Public Affairs. If you have demonstrated your commitment to excellence, your efforts will be rewarded with well-deserved accolades, new responsibilities or a boost in your income. But if you've been dragging your feet, you must make up for lost time. Don't wait until the last minute to prepare for the final exam. The more sweat equity you invest now, the more rewards you receive down the road."
aries,2015-09-19,"Your unrestrained confidence can create problems, unless you scale back your adventurous ambitions just a touch. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell where to draw the line between reality and fantasy today, making a simple decision more complex. Widening your spiritual horizons is easy now; however, maintaining a solid connection with the mundane world at the same time is where the true magic occurs. Nevertheless, keeping one foot in the real world is certainly worth the effort if you want to manifest your dreams."
taurus,2015-09-19,"Your newly acquired fascination with philosophy could have you thinking that you have discovered the meaning of life. Unfortunately, others might see your esoteric explorations in a different light. They are concerned you're evading important issues by pontificating about ephemeral ideas that are removed from the actual events of the day. Although your search for truth may seem cavalier, there's no need to change anything now as long as you're respectful to the reactions of those around you. There are mysteries waiting to be solved if you're willing to be a cosmic detective."
gemini,2015-09-19,"You are indescribably happy if the pace slows down a notch today, but you secretly wish that things would return to normal. The good news is you have a perfect chance to review your recent experiences and plan your next move. Just remember that there is a cosmic magnifying lens between you and your world now, making everything appear bigger, better or more significant than it truly is. Giving yourself a reality check is healthier than waiting for someone else to do it for you."
cancer,2015-09-19,"Your current sense of optimism has you believing that anything you can imagine will come true. Although a positive outlook on your future might be sufficient to tip the scales in your favor, other less pleasant variables should be taken into consideration, too. It's not necessary to adjust your attitude as long as you're also willing to confront the difficulties in an objective light. Fortunately, overcoming obstacles in your path is easier once you recognize the role they play in your learning process. Transforming into a peaceful warrior allows you to win in the end."
leo,2015-09-19,"It may seem as if you're sitting pretty now when it comes to matters of money or love. Nevertheless, you might still be clinging to old insecurities about a close relationship or a financial venture. The truth is that your self-image could suffer if you spend too much time analyzing all the details. You probably have more tricks up your sleeve than you realize today. The quickest way to regain your swagger is to project yourself into the future instead of looking back into the past. Live long and prosper."
virgo,2015-09-19,"Your innate affinity for perfection is often useful, but now it can turn into an obsession that blocks your path to happiness. You may grow uncomfortable with your current starry-eyed visions and suddenly decide to rein in your fantasies. Unfortunately, you could pull back so hard and fast today that your caution causes you to miss out on a wonderful opportunity. You don't need to lower your standards as long as you remain open to working with a diamond in the rough and polishing it as you go along."
libra,2015-09-19,"Interpersonal issues that linger from a recent emotional meltdown seem to be closer to resolution today. Although your worries might not be completely put to rest, at least you have a chance to raise the vibration to a higher level now. Instead of struggling for dominance or survival, shift your focus to more spiritual matters. Practice the Golden Rule whenever possible; surprisingly, you can release anger or resentment if you simply act with compassion rather than fear."
scorpio,2015-09-19,"You might set your sights on establishing new financial goals now that the Moon is setting up shop in your 2nd House of Wealth. However, with stern Saturn lurking in the neighborhood, the connection between your self-esteem and your net worth is stronger than ever. There are many practical things you can do to augment your income and increase your assets, but an attitude makeover is more important than anything else today. It's more likely others will invest in you if you truly value yourself."
sagittarius,2015-09-19,"It's nearly impossible to keep your feelings under wraps because you're wearing your heart on your sleeve today. The moody Moon is visiting your 1st House of Self and She has her own communication style that bypasses words and social pleasantries. Nevertheless, it's unwise to just assume that anyone knows your emotional process unless you take the time to specifically tell them. Confiding in someone who has earned your trust will instantaneously lighten your load and brighten your day."
capricorn,2015-09-19,"Your need to strut your stuff in the real world conflicts today with your current desire to work in solitude. Additionally, the reflective Moon's presence in your 12th House of Privacy widens this gulf. However, neither extreme is an acceptable course of action now, even if you believe you must choose one way over the other. Change the game by imagining a scenario where you magically appear on center stage when called, yet are still able to escape the clamor of the audience when you want to be alone."
aquarius,2015-09-19,"You're driven by your dreams now that the visionary Sagittarius Moon is influencing your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes. Unfortunately, you might not have enough common sense today to know which of your ideas are practical enough to follow and which ones should be set aside. Thankfully, there's no need to decide yet; just allow your thoughts to take you on a fascinating ride without being bound to any single outcome. The sky is the limit when your imagination is running the show."
pisces,2015-09-19,"Although you may feel as if you're perched atop a mountain peak -- or, at least have a clear path to reach the summit-- others might not see your success in the same light. The Moon's current spotlight on your 10th House of Career inspires you to make big plans to fulfill your professional ambitions, even if people doubt your ability. Don't be discouraged by the naysayers; go ahead and reach for the stars. Just remember, gravity is still at work; make sure you have a parachute handy in case you get lost in space."
aries,2015-09-20,"Trusting the universe is a no-brainer when you're sure that everything is going your way. Even if you recently overstepped your limits, you should be able to make amends and come out smelling like a rose. Nevertheless, you are still playing with fire and could effortlessly charm people with your passionate nature. However, your integrity is at stake so don't promise more than you can deliver today. Be sincere and others will respect you for who you are without harboring any false illusions."
taurus,2015-09-20,It's such a treat when you feel comfortable enough with your life that you let your hair down and totally relax. Responsibilities finally take a back seat while you embark on a leisurely drive to soak in the colorful scenery. But don't be so fascinated by all the pretty sights that you forget to stop and appreciate where you are today. Feeding your soul with out-of-the-ordinary experiences puts a smile on your face and a bounce in your step.
gemini,2015-09-20,"It's as if you've been handed a ""Get Out of Jail Free"" card today to use any way you wish. Perhaps you were feeling emotionally restrained by a relationship and suddenly it seems as if the restrictions are lifted. Now's your chance to show your enthusiasm for life and your adoration for those you love. The deeper issues are still present, but your renewed sense of hope allows for real progress to be made when the conversation continues. Unchaining your heart gives you a whole new perspective on life."
cancer,2015-09-20,"Having the time to add some spontaneous fun to your day is a true blessing and you know you should be grateful. But, ironically, you might choose to work on a project at home or finish up some overdue chores, instead. Mischievous Tom Sawyer pretended to enjoy painting a fence so he could persuade others to join him. However, you aren't seeking any assistance; you're simply having a good time being productive on your own terms. But don't eliminate the possibility of participating in a social activity or two today. Don't sell yourself short now; you can enjoy the best of both worlds."
leo,2015-09-20,"Your childlike approach to life often draws a crowd around you in search of a good time. Your playful demeanor is off the charts today and you are wired into the innocent spontaneity of the unfolding cosmos. In fact, you're willing to try nearly anything in search of a memorable experience. Humor is your best ally now when it comes to connecting with others. There's no reason to resist the joy in the air; laugh and the entire world laughs with you."
virgo,2015-09-20,"Your imagination knows no bounds today and your dreams can fuel a most unexpected escape. It's not even necessary for others to hear or see your burst of creative energy; it may safely remain within the confines of your mind. However, don't discount the possibility of expressing yourself in a more demonstrative manner. Redecorating a room in your home or redefining a relationship might be the perfect outlet for your artistic talents. Listening to your heart is mandatory; acting on your feelings is your choice alone."
libra,2015-09-20,"If only there was a way to bottle your unbridled enthusiasm and save it for a rainy day. In theory, this should be one of those amazing days for the record books. In practice, you might bite off more than you can chew. If you don't want to suffer from a physical or emotional hangover tomorrow, rein in your fiery energy just a touch. Fortunately, there's no need to play it cool today; just find that magical spot where the universe hangs in perfect balance and everything will be fine."
scorpio,2015-09-20,"Unplugging for the day might be just what the doctor ordered as a remedy to what ails you. The cosmos has conjured up the perfect emotional weather today for you to set your worries aside and leave your chores behind. Naturally, no one can talk you out of focusing on a project that is already in progress. But unfinished business and unresolved issues will still be there when you return. The healing that comes from temporarily shedding responsibilities is priceless and gives you the impetus to pursue your ambitions tomorrow."
sagittarius,2015-09-20,"You might be ready to get out your guitar to sing your old familiar theme song, ""Don't Fence Me In."" You want plenty of room to roam, space to breathe and time to pursue a variety of interests. The only downside is, no matter how hard you work at it today, you can't do everything you want. Nevertheless, it won't hurt to try. In fact, you might just experience the freedom you crave if you temporarily drop the word no from your vocabulary. For now, anything is possible if you're willing to say yes."
capricorn,2015-09-20,"Sometimes you are so driven by your ambitions that you forget to stop and replenish your soul. Thankfully, you can finally engineer a real day of rest without feeling guilty that you should be doing something else. While others might just take off without notice, it helps to schedule your downtime on your calendar in advance, as if it is an important meeting not to be missed. The fact of the matter is you have an appointment with yourself, unencumbered by the stress of your everyday life. Give yourself the gift of time before it's too late."
aquarius,2015-09-20,"You are visited by an angel today who grants you one of your wishes out of the blue. Perhaps a close friend or partner surprises you with an exciting adventure. Or maybe someone simply encourages you to take the risk that you've been sitting on the fence about recently. Whatever cosmic nudge comes your way now, interpret it as a sign that the universe wants you to break out of the rut that's been holding you back. This unexpected opportunity for personal growth may vanish in thin air if you don't grab it right away. It's better to fail spectacularly than to live a life of regret."
pisces,2015-09-20,"Knowing your place in a relationship, your family or the community gives you solid ground on which to launch your next project. Your mind is probably brimming with good ideas these days, but you might be uncertain which one is worth your undivided attention. Logical analysis won't help you set your priorities or determine a strategy to reach your goals. Intuition is your best friend today; strike now while the iron is hot and color in the details later on."
aries,2015-09-21,"Although your intentions may be honorable, it's not a simple matter to keep your feelings to yourself. You might even acknowledge that what you are about to say should probably be left unspoken, but you may blurt it out anyway in a moment of excitement. Unfortunately, you can't take your words back once they are out in the open. Everyone knows that honesty is the best policy, but remember to think twice before you create an untenable situation. A little conscious self-restraint before the fact is wiser than an apology after it's too late."
taurus,2015-09-21,"Your sensory antenna are tingling today and you notice things you might ordinarily miss, prompting you to be more emotionally volatile now than usual. You're certain that your conclusions are correct and could easily start trying to convince others to see the future in the same light as you. However, it's dangerous to believe there's only a single perfect outcome and you know exactly what it is. Stay ahead of the curve by entertaining all possibilities before you fixate on just one. Keep in mind what works for you doesn't necessarily work for anyone else."
gemini,2015-09-21,"There are a lot of wheels spinning in your head, but it's prudent to keep most of your thoughts on the down low today. Ironically, your ideas are likely quite enlightening, but everyone will conclude your thinking is scattered if you keep changing your plans. Thankfully, you can still be more productive than others expect once you make a final decision. You newly found resolve is so strong that you won't give up until you reach your goal, making you a truly formidable opponent or a steadfastly loyal friend."
cancer,2015-09-21,"Stepping back from an explosive situation is smart, but you may get swept up in an emotional melodrama before you know it today. Reassess your involvement prior to doing something you might later regret. In fact, withdrawing your energy is your safest move if you decide that it's really not your business. On the other hand, if participating in this conflict is truly necessary, at least detach yourself from any specific outcome. Your contribution will be more valuable to the group process now if you use your head and not your heart."
leo,2015-09-21,"You may become irritated today with someone who doesn't usually get under your skin, yet you can't put your finger directly on the source of your annoyance. Perhaps a coworker might bring up a sensitive subject that stirs deep emotions you have been purposefully trying to avoid. Whatever the circumstances are in the moment, it's time to face the music. Fortunately, your residual angst will begin to dissipate if you have the courage to put your feelings out on the table. Shining light into the shadows banishes your fear of the dark."
virgo,2015-09-21,"You might become sorely disappointed in yourself if you end up letting down someone who is counting on you today. Nevertheless, you won't likely sit still long enough to take the heat for something that is not in your control. Thankfully, you're too results-oriented to waste time wallowing in self-pity or drowning in self-doubt now. Dust yourself off and reclaim your power; determine what went wrong, improve your plan and try again before you lose momentum. Practice makes perfect."
libra,2015-09-21,"Your opinions won't necessarily become any less extreme today just because the emotional intensity has started to wane. You could be unusually stubborn about your version of the truth and may even be uncharacteristically impatient with anyone who tries to change your mind. The good news is you have an opportunity to listen carefully to what others say now without being required to agree with any of their conclusions. Putting your exemplary diplomatic skills to good use has never been more important than during these volatile times. Let there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with you."
scorpio,2015-09-21,"You're tired of setting ambitious goals and then falling short of your own lofty expectations. Fortunately, the strategic Capricorn Moon's visit to your 3rd House of Immediate Environment provides you with the structure you need to execute your plan without deviation. Nevertheless, you could create unnecessary opposition by inadvertently angering someone if you're too forceful in your approach. Persistence works in your favor if you know when to wear a velvet glove and when to take it off."
sagittarius,2015-09-21,"You can see right through people's excuses today and your incisive observations might make them quite nervous. Paradoxically, you could be absolutely correct in your assumptions yet only make matters worse by raising a sensitive subject in an inconsiderate manner. There's no reason to avoid a necessary discussion now as long as you steer clear of any type of judgmental criticism. Adopting an open-minded and compassionate approach puts others at ease; you can achieve the impossible when everyone sets aside their egos and concentrates on the common good."
capricorn,2015-09-21,"You could be the proverbial go-to person of your group because everyone thinks you have the secret to success in your pocket. You may have a particularly strong grip on reality now, increasing your sense of authority even more. But don't mistakenly believe that your vision is the right answer for everyone just because you can effortlessly navigate your way into the future. Acknowledging that multiple solutions are possible earns you even more credibility points with your workmates in the long run."
aquarius,2015-09-21,"You are working with a unique set of objectives today, yet the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Privacy suggests that you are determined to hide your plans from others. Perhaps you want to avoid premature judgment before you put your new strategy into motion. Or, maybe you just need to prove your mettle, so you choose to venture out on your own. Keep in mind that a collaborative effort with the right person will strengthen your hand and increase your overall effectiveness. Believe it or not, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
pisces,2015-09-21,"Your peers may be unfairly critical of your performance today, yet you can still learn something constructive from what they say. Unfortunately, you might not want to listen to anyone's advice now because of your own issues of low self-esteem. Thankfully, you can find a pearl of wisdom in this awkward exchange once you simply acknowledge your insecurities. Being transparent about your process is the current key to self-improvement. Seeing yourself as a work in progress gives you the inspiration to create a masterpiece."
aries,2015-09-22,"You are resolved to fulfill your heart's desires, but may be growing frustrated because everything you want seems to take longer than anticipated. Fortunately, you aren't so quick to give in to negativity now. Recent delays were only temporary and your persistence will ultimately play out in your favor. Nevertheless, there's no reason to hide your impatience. Ultimately, your undying enthusiasm will be your key to climbing the ladder of success or winning the love of someone special."
taurus,2015-09-22,"Your coworkers might get a sudden taste of your obstinate nature today, even if you aren't expressing the full intensity of your feelings. You may believe that what you really want is so far outside the range of acceptability that you must refrain from saying anything at all. However, your well-intended discretion can backfire now, making you feel alienated from others. Luckily, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition. Taking smaller risks is much more likely to be rewarded if you're willing to exercise patience and display a generosity of spirit."
gemini,2015-09-22,"Your desire to do things differently today can be a bit disorientating for everyone involved. Nevertheless, you still want to impress others with your famous multi-tasking skills while you juggle many tasks at once. Innovation may be your strong suit now, but too much originality could end up sending you back to the drawing board. Instead of shocking others with your radical ideas, transform your unconventional approach into a slightly more conservative one for the best results. Considering the reaction of your audience first increases the likelihood of success."
cancer,2015-09-22,"Although you may blast through your regular self-imposed limits today, you still might have mixed feelings about revealing your true intentions. You're eager to engage with others by sharing your deepest emotions; however, you simultaneously wish you had more personal space to call your own. Even if you are resistant to letting go of your fear of rejection, this impulsive self-disclosure is a great opportunity to stretch outside of your comfort zone."
leo,2015-09-22,"Keeping your emotions in check is more challenging than you think. You know what the logical thing is to do, but something still drives you to take a different course of action that brings you right to the edge of rebellion. Don't waste time in unnecessary deliberation. Instead, speak up and ask for what you really want, even if it's not what others expect. Take pride in the aspirations of your heart; be the Lion you are and roar like you mean it."
virgo,2015-09-22,"Living on your own little island sounds like an idyllic situation today. People think you're fully engaged in a friendly conversation or engrossed in your work, but you are actually busy hiding your passionate emotions. There's no need to satisfy anyone else's expectations of you now. Be true to yourself and take whatever personal time you need to sort out your feelings. Sometimes separating from the crowd is justifiable so you can work things out on your own."
libra,2015-09-22,"A simple relationship issue rattles your world today when someone reveals his or her emotions and then impatiently waits for your response. However, you might not have a clue about what you what while non-conformist Uranus is rocking your key planet Venus; you just can't seem to shake off the restraints on your heart. In fact, your current indecision might be insurmountable, so it's in your best interest to let the other person decide for both of you now. Conflict does not serve you well; thankfully, you're a champion of practicing the art of compromise."
scorpio,2015-09-22,"Someone might be maneuvering you into a corner today and you don't like one little bit. However, events are unfolding too quickly to manage and you resent being coerced to fall into line. You may seem willing to play along with the crowd now, but you're probably busy cooking up your own resistance so you can plant your feet when the time is right. Don't react immediately; your position will only increase in strength if you can delay your response until the frenetic pace settles down. The element of surprise is a perfect secret weapon when you use it at the just right moment."
sagittarius,2015-09-22,"You may appear like a footloose and fancy-free Archer today, but behind your fun-loving demeanor lurks a more serious character. Nevertheless, electrical Uranus is zapping seductive Venus in your 9th House of Big Ideas, drawing your attention away from work and aiming it toward social pleasures. But you're also acutely aware of pressing obligations that must be addressed before you go out in search of adventure. Normally, you are the one who tells others to lighten up and stop taking life so seriously, but now you should remind yourself. You only live once."
capricorn,2015-09-22,"You're caught between two opposing strategies in response to your current circumstances. On one hand, you're determined to reward yourself for your hard work. There are treats already waiting for you and it would be all-too-easy to take advantage of what the universe is offering. However, on the other hand, you might not be able to forget about your responsibilities, even after you complete your chores. Honestly, you have earned the right to relax; give yourself unmitigated permission to enjoy the good times while they last."
aquarius,2015-09-22,"There is a palpable high-frequency buzz in the atmosphere today. Luckily, you can use this exciting energy to move closer to your current heart's desires as your key planet Uranus shocks sweet Venus. Unfortunately, someone might stand between you and the fun you know you deserve. Acknowledging the resistance you receive from others now enables you to consider their feelings prior to exploring a whole new world of alternatives. Ultimately, it's up to you to judge if the potential pleasure is still worth the consequences."
pisces,2015-09-22,"Taking a leap of faith and exposing your dreams to the outer world is risky business. However, your timing couldn't be better now, so don't give up even if you also experience a strong reality check in the process. Keep in mind that some of your fantasies may be better left unrealized. Nevertheless, your friends and coworkers are unusually receptive to your far-out ideas. Move forward with your plans today; step out of your imagination and into your future."
aries,2015-09-23,"Although you can be quite generous in spirit when you so choose, you're an independent Ram and there are times when you simply forget about the needs of others. But partnerships require more bandwidth once the Sun takes up residence in your 7th House of Relationships today. Stop chasing your dreams long enough to consciously consider what someone else wants. Demonstrating respect  to those around you shifts the energy and enables things to run much smoother than you ever expected. Life is meant to be shared."
taurus,2015-09-23,"You might not be aware of how much others look up to you now, yet even little things you do strongly influence them. However, you could be less concerned with anyone else's perceptions than you are with completing your chores today. It's tempting to narrow your vision to concentrate on maintaining your regular routine while the Sun inhabits your 6th House of Habits. But don't let your current obsession with the details get in the way of being fully present for your friends and family. Honor your core values and everything will work out for the best."
gemini,2015-09-23,"You're not in a very practical mood today, so it's wise to enjoy your colorful fantasies without trying to manifest them into reality. Luckily, there's nothing wrong with escaping into your daydreams for a little while; this harmless reverie can even provide inspirational food for thought. Just make sure you remain aware of the difference between the idle wanderings of your imagination and what's actually expected of you in the real world. Don't miss your chance to dance on the creative edge while the Sun is shining in your 5th House of Self-Expression. Life is what you make it."
cancer,2015-09-23,"Nothing brings you more pleasure now than hanging out in your castle with those you love. The Sun's current visit to your 4th House of Roots turns your attention inward and sets a nostalgic tone. Ironically, you might even consider traveling -- in the real world or in your imagination -- all the way back to the place of your origins. However, this isn't just a walk down memory lane; engaging in serious self-reflection strengthens your foundation for the months ahead. Learning something meaningful about your past inspires you to be more successful in the future."
leo,2015-09-23,Your calendar is filling up quickly and life seems to be running at a faster pace now that the Sun is lighting up your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. But complications arise if you can't manage your time effectively because your tight schedule is quite unforgiving today. Don't get flustered if you fall behind or miss a step; just be honest with everyone affected and continue to do the best you can to be in several places at once. Your heroic efforts are appreciated more than you know.
virgo,2015-09-23,"Your ambivalence over a fundamental issue can make a particular decision rather difficult. Unfortunately, a new wave of confusion may sour your actions with doubt and uncertainty as the Sun slips into your 2nd House of Values. Thankfully, there's no need to change your mind or alter your plans today, especially if you're unsure of your options. Hang tight; your confidence will rebound before you know it. In the meantime, sorting through all of your alternatives now gives you the best chance to make the right choice at the right moment."
libra,2015-09-23,"Your mental clarity is razor sharp now as the brilliant Sun sets up shop in your creative sign. You're capable of making intelligent decisions that are based upon your keen sense of objectivity. However, your thinking is likely to change again with retrograde Mercury also camping out in Libra. Fortunately, sentimentality won't likely lead you off course today. Accept subjective artistic leanings as lovely inspirations brightening your day; incorporate what you can and leave the rest for another time."
scorpio,2015-09-23,"Although this may not be what you want to hear today, there's no reason to waste your precious energy and limited resources on starting anything new now. The radiant Sun's shift into your 12th House of Endings is a powerful reminder to complete current projects and tie up as many loose ends as possible. Keeping a low profile allows you to focus on the more spiritual aspects of your life. There are many treasures to discover in other dimensions if you are willing to suspend your disbelief and let your imagination wander."
sagittarius,2015-09-23,"Your friends and associates may be nearly impossible to read today, leaving you uncertain about where they fit in your current plans. Unfortunately, your ideas might not be as clear as you think, creating problems you haven't even considered. But don't blame your lack of confidence on anyone else or you will just drift further away from your goals. Accepting responsibility for your actions now inspires you to take matters into your own hands. Mahatma Gandhi advised, ""Be the change that you wish to see in the world."""
capricorn,2015-09-23,"All you can think about now is your career as you ambitiously plan for your future. Fortunately, your professional objectives may be clearly illuminated during the weeks ahead as the Sun travels through your 10th House of Public Responsibility. However, your preoccupation with work can strain your personal life as fulfilling your obligations distracts you from cultivating emotional connections. Establishing a healthy balance in your life is more important than reaching some imagined pinnacle of success. Humans can not live on bread alone."
aquarius,2015-09-23,"You are strongly drawn in two distinct directions now as the Sun brightens fellow air sign Libra. Additionally, the Moon's return to your futuristic sign adds an emotional twist to an intellectual problem today. Still, your primary challenge is to remain optimistic without losing touch with reality. Deepening a close connection with someone you trust inspires you to keep your dreams alive. Author and activist Helen Keller declared, ""Walking with a friend in the dark is better than walking alone in the light."""
pisces,2015-09-23,"You may be uncomfortable with the information imbalance today if someone shares too many personal details and you don't say anything in return. No matter how pressing the situation seems now, there's a part of you that doesn't want to deal with the drama. Although you might actually believe that whatever you don't know can't hurt you, it's simply not the case. Even unexpressed thoughts create ripples in the atmosphere, so it's smarter to ask questions and listen to the rest of the story when someone asks for your advice. The only way to have a friend is to be one."
aries,2015-09-24,"A casual conversation might lead you to places you weren't expecting to visit today, but stepping into new emotional territory is fuel for your growth. Exploring uncharted realms typically isn't a burden because you actually thrive on new experiences. However, you may grow anxious when you realize you're standing on shaky ground now. Be courageous and face your fears; opening your heart is the first step toward transforming your life."
taurus,2015-09-24,"You like the idea of being practical but your attempts at staying grounded may be futile today as you find yourself embarking on a rather unexpected adventure. Logic can't explain the intensity of your current passion, yet all is just as it should be when it comes to matters of the heart. Intellectualizing the reasons for this spontaneous detour will only take you so far. Embrace your feelings, whether they are rational or not. Walking on the emotional edge now offers the kind of benefits that make your vulnerability worth the risk."
gemini,2015-09-24,"There are countless ways to express your creativity today and your best strategy is to explore as many of them as possible. Your attraction to multiple choices enables you to shine as you experiment with different styles of communication. But you may run into trouble if someone thinks that one of your approaches is brilliant, for he or she might want you to use that method alone. However, you are following the unique beat of your own drum now, so don't compromise your artistic authenticity to satisfy anyone else."
cancer,2015-09-24,"Your sensitivity is a mixed blessing today because you can't avoid feeling someone else's pain or discomfort with your emotional revelation. However, when you recognize that this awkward tension is not about personal rejection, you may be able to grant him or her the necessary freedom for a new kind of connection to blossom. Learning how to give others the space they require actually brings them closer to you in the long run. Hold on loosely, but don't let go."
leo,2015-09-24,"You have a chance to leap beyond your old limits as the independent Aquarius Moon skips through your 7th House Partners. It may be easier to entertain a relationship with less of a commitment now because you are feeling more emotionally secure. Exploring your passions could lead you in an unexpected direction if you have the courage to remain open to change. Honest communication is the way through the door to love, but you must let go of what you once thought was true if you want to find the partner of your dreams."
virgo,2015-09-24,"It's nearly impossible to escape from the obligations of your daily grind now. Needless to say, focusing on the work at hand isn't that unusual for you masters of efficiency. But your regular routine isn't necessarily the same old thing these days as you seek ways to reinvent yourself to prevent boredom from settling in. Don't be afraid to shake things up, for the invigoration you can feel should outweigh any fear of change. Variety is the spice of life."
libra,2015-09-24,"You are naturally adept at gracefully sidestepping almost any complex issue that pops up. However, your feelings are stretched into disquieting places today in order to uncover the truth. Fortunately, this emotional roller-coaster ride doesn't seem as scary while the Sun is shining its light in your objective sign. Remember, it's not about being safe now; it's about doing whatever it takes to get to the heart of the matter. Poet T.S. Eliot said, ""Only those who will risk going too far can possibly find out how far one can go."""
scorpio,2015-09-24,"Although you may be resigned to talk about your fears, it's still daunting to bring them out into the open. Thankfully, you receive cosmic assistance from expressive Mercury as it pushes against powerful Pluto in your 3rd House of Communication. However, it's still frightening when deeply buried feelings are finally exposed. Even if you are able to share them with someone who has your best interests at heart, it's not fun if the ensuing conversation is like rubbing salt on a wound. Nevertheless, your willingness to go on an intense emotional journey can transform your life in ways you can't imagine."
sagittarius,2015-09-24,"Your unique path toward your goals may take a surprising turn today once you realize that something is just too important to ignore. You might not do anything about it yet, but it's still an excellent idea to consider modifying your priorities to honor your need to speak your truth. More conventional measures of success are not of interest to you now. Don't waste energy telling anyone about your change of heart until you are more comfortable with explaining exactly what you want. Shakespeare says it best, ""To thine own self be true."""
capricorn,2015-09-24,"You're standing at the threshold to your future but aren't quite ready to make that first big step off the ledge today. You may receive tantalizing glimpses of what's around the corner but it's still too soon to say anything about it. Instead of sharing your rapidly shifting perceptions, it's wiser to stay in observation mode without making any drastic changes now. Continue to quietly gather information and don't allow anyone to drag you into a conversation about your plans. Nevertheless, be ready to take flight when the universe calls; you're on the launch pad and the moment of ignition will arrive sooner than you think."
aquarius,2015-09-24,"You aren't thrilled when your moods fluctuate so often because you can't settle into enjoying the pleasures that otherwise seem so close. Although your current restlessness could hinder your happiness, there's little you can do to change the cause of your dissatisfaction today. In fact, it's healthier to stir up unexpressed feelings now instead of suppressing them. Ultimately, moving the emotional energy can reestablish your positive outlook and provide a newly found stability."
pisces,2015-09-24,"Everyone might assume you're focusing your complete attention on the tasks at hand, but you're actually taking care of more sacred work now. Fortunately, you can quickly erect an effective smokescreen that throws people off course, giving you the freedom to embark on a spiritual quest or to explore your romantic fantasies. Enjoy your metaphysical excursion today without feeling the need to share anything with others until you return. Traveling in magical realms is easy once you master hearing without your ears, seeing without your eyes and speaking without your tongue."
aries,2015-09-25,"It's an exercise in futility to start anything new today, especially if you're worrying about the criticism you might receive. You may wonder if it's too late to make your move, but there's nothing to be gained by wallowing in self-doubt now. Be grateful for small accomplishments, even if they don't meet your expectations. Luckily, you can pick up the speed in a day or two after impatient Mars is free from Saturn's choking restraints. In the meantime, channeling your excess energy into some form of strenuous physical activity is one of the healthier ways to manage your current dissatisfaction. Sweat more, whine less."
taurus,2015-09-25,"You may be completely convinced that you need to  set aside your individual desires to manage a heavy load of responsibilities at work now that go-getter Mars squares off with taskmaster Saturn. But instead of  putting your emotions in a box and closing the door to your heart, establish healthy priorities that honor both your personal and professional goals. You know what they say about all work and no play, so make room for fun whenever you get the chance."
gemini,2015-09-25,"Relationship concerns gobble up your bandwidth today, leaving little time for anything else. It doesn't really matter how lofty your career-related goals are now, you can't focus on them with a clear head until you handle the more pressing personal issues. Thankfully, you don't have to jump through outrageous hoops to demonstrate your  commitment. Just show up with an open mind and a vulnerable heart. If you remember to speak less and listen more, you might be pleased with how much ground you can cover."
cancer,2015-09-25,"You are being asked to reevaluate your objectives at work because your previous assumptions may have wandered off track somewhere along the way. But instead of scrambling to create a new game plan, reassess the situation and be certain that all the loose ends are tied up before deciding on your next step. It's more important to prove your competence now than it is to reach for the brass ring. A methodical approach today minimizes unnecessary trouble tomorrow."
leo,2015-09-25,"An emotional complication ripples its way to the surface in a relationship today, leaving you disheartened and wondering what to do next. Nevertheless, you're hesitant to reveal what's really on your mind. Even if someone attempts to manipulate your actions, they can't change how you react. Unfortunately, doing whatever is demanded of you while hiding your true feelings could create an undertow of resentment. Honor your own heart by facing your resistance now and telling the truth. Transparency is your friend."
virgo,2015-09-25,"Your best efforts on the job may be thwarted now, no matter how diligently you work at overcoming the obstacles. You have plenty of stamina while warrior Mars is empowering your practical sign. But it feels so much like you're rolling boulders up a steep hill today that you wonder if it's worth all the stress. However, it's necessary to keep trying since you know better than anyone that when the going gets tough, the tough get going. Your high standards and admirable tenacity make for an unbeatable combination."
libra,2015-09-25,"If your resources are stretched too thin today, your only logical answer is to cut back on your extraneous commitments. But don't waste energy complaining about the scarcity of time and money or your coworkers might grow annoyed with your negativity. Instead, roll up your sleeves and demonstrate your clever ingenuity by finding a way to improve your situation. Once you consciously shift your focus in a positive direction, others will do the same. In fact, you might be pleasantly surprised at how the universe steps in to help those who are busy helping themselves."
scorpio,2015-09-25,"Your friends and relatives might not be the most enthusiastic of cheerleaders now when it comes to supporting your work. Nevertheless, it's still helpful to recognize you have allies on your side, even if it doesn't feel that way in the present moment. Rather than attempting to convince others to join your cause today, release them from any expectations and manage things on your own. This way if someone chooses to offer assistance, you can rest assured it will be a true act of generosity instead of a false pretense that originates from a sense of obligation. One real friend in the hand is worth many in the bush."
sagittarius,2015-09-25,"Your best intentions are being stymied today and nothing you do seems to fix the situation. The current dynamics at work could push your buttons and test your resolve to get things done. Don't let your anger hijack the day; losing your temper only makes matters worse. Sharing your feelings in a calm and rational manner is a more constructive approach. Luckily, you'll have a chance to air your grievances soon enough. In the meantime, act for the good of all instead of trying to even the score."
capricorn,2015-09-25,"Stick to your schedule today or it could fall apart like a house of cards tumbling in front of your eyes. You may be tempted to walk away from all your responsibilities, but avoidance is not in your best interest. Planning ahead is always a good idea, but first you must acknowledge everything could take longer to finish than you expect. Adding extra time between activities allows you to work at a consistent pace without worrying that you'll lose control of your day. Your determination to stay on point earns you respect and admiration. Proving your competence to others is one thing but satisfying your own expectations is entirely something else."
aquarius,2015-09-25,"You may feel a bit lost today as the reality of reaching your goals slips out of your grasp. However, don't write yourself off too quickly because the game isn't over yet. There's no time to linger in the land of discouragement now, even if your recent efforts didn't manifest your desired results. Prematurely admitting failure could stand between you and the success that is just around the next corner. Be persistent and continue to work for what you want; striving for excellence lets the rest of the world know you mean business."
pisces,2015-09-25,"Achieving your goals is an impossible dream today if they are solely built upon your vivid fantasies. Something has to give because you might not be able to keep up with your own ambitious aspirations, no matter how many tricks you have up your sleeve. It's smarter to scale back your hopes now than waiting until everything crashes down around your feet. Formulating a strategic action plan based on reality and not your imagination allows you to create a healthy balance in your life."
aries,2015-09-26,"You receive a fleeting glimpse of clarity today,  but confusion quickly sets in before you have a chance to see the entire picture. Every question you answer peels off another layer of the onion. Seeking positive solutions may feel like a hopeless battle now. However, your current determination empowers you to defeat any negativity that clouds your view. You can become a hero in your own world if you summon your courage from the wellsprings within."
taurus,2015-09-26,"Getting a grip on the energy of the day is not as easy as it sounds because circumstances keep shifting beneath your feet. Nevertheless, the greatest challenges may come from your friends and associates while the Moon is busy mixing and mingling in your 11th House of Networking. You're prepared to separate yourself from the group if others aren't acting sensibly now. But you don't need to make any drastic moves; there are plenty of goodies to be discovered if you allow enough time to untangle the complexities. Give people a second chance to show their stuff before writing them off."
gemini,2015-09-26,"It's rather unsettling when the facts aim you one way while your intuitive hunch sends you in a completely different direction. But instead of jumping to a totally erroneous conclusion today, take your time and analyze the possibilities until your feelings are more certain about the present circumstances. Wait until after tomorrow's eclipse to gain more clarity about your choices before swinging into action. Working with the energy of the universe serves you well."
cancer,2015-09-26,"Although you're quite patient when there's a good reason, you grow so restless now that you don't want to wait another minute balancing your desires with other people's schedules. You have gathered the pertinent information and successfully developed your plan. However, you may be visualizing your ideal fantasies today more than you are zoning in on reality. You made it this far, so don't ruin everything with one reckless move. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
leo,2015-09-26,"The spoken word carries great intensity today and can even reopen an old wound. However, it's crucial to look beyond the present circumstances and carefully consider the original source of the pain. Think about any previous situations that are brought to mind by current events. Explore your resistance to letting go of the past. Nevertheless, this isn't solely about your inner process; you must share your memories for true healing to begin. Making peace with your personal history empowers you to step methodically toward final resolution. When you close one door, another opens."
virgo,2015-09-26,"Irrational relationship fears may haunt you today, but you might struggle to expressing your deeply rooted emotions. Try not to let your insecurities stop you from sharing your heart now, for negative feelings can be destructive if you let them bottle up inside. Make time to have the type of conversations you typically prefer to postpone. Review what you intend to say and then execute your plan without further ado. Believe it or not, the first step is the hardest step."
libra,2015-09-26,"Happiness may be as elusive as a butterfly now, but it's clear that your daily routine is in need of a dramatic change. On the surface, it seems like shaking up the current situation should be a simple task, but the closer you get to taking action, the more complicated it becomes. Don't give up just because you are feeling a bit confused today. Personal revolutions don't happen overnight; believe in yourself and you can't go wrong."
scorpio,2015-09-26,"You just can't stop obsessing over something that's been bothering you recently. You intuitively understand that the only way anything will improve is to talk about it until the energy settles. However, it's painful to wear your heart on your sleeve because the resultant vulnerability makes you incredibly uncomfortable today. Be fearless; move directly toward the source of your discomfort now, not away from it. The way out is the way through."
sagittarius,2015-09-26,"It's as if your head and your heart aren't working in tandem today; they may even be reading from different adventure novels. You're feeling softer and more sentimental than you are acting as your confident behavior masks your true sensitivity. Thankfully, you can regain your center of gravity by looking within and exploring your motives for keeping your passions quiet. There's no need to hide behind a false sense of bravado; just be true to yourself and let the chips fall where they may."
capricorn,2015-09-26,You are a pillar of strength today once you let go of your tendency toward self-criticism. You're  eager to explore all the ways you can offer moral support to others. Your carefully picked words have a soothing effect and there are coworkers who can actually use your encouragement now. Push beyond any personal resistance to the idea of being a healer and start listening to those around you with an open heart. Lending an ear to someone in need makes all the difference in the world.
aquarius,2015-09-26,"Even small doses of self-doubt are debilitating today, especially if they prevent you from participating in a significant discussion. Luckily, your thoughts are quite powerful and directly connected to your core essence now. Your common-sense perspective is desperately needed these days, no matter how many brilliant ideas you have to offer. Share your opinions, but be cautious about overstating your case in order to cover up your uncertainty. Keeping things simple is your key to success."
pisces,2015-09-26,"Your dream life may be too spellbinding to resist now that the Moon is splashing around with Neptune in your watery sign. Go ahead and explore your visions today, but be wary about using them to escape from the difficult emotions attached to real world circumstances. Fortunately, the symbolism that bubbles up from your unconscious might be the catalyst that suddenly clarifies your current choices. Paying rapt attention to the signs of the universe can transform your life in ways you can't yet imagine."
aries,2015-09-27,"There isn't much of a chance that you can restrain your feelings today because the Full Moon Eclipse in your reckless sign urges you to say whatever is on your mind. Nevertheless, you can demonstrate your wisdom by following someone else's lead now and erring on the side of discretion. Instead of telling others to act with common sense, do it yourself. Count to ten before flying off the handle about something that won't ultimately matter. Words have power; use them wisely."
taurus,2015-09-27,"Although responsibilities can weigh you down today, they can't prevent you from escaping into your fantasies. The Aries Full Moon Eclipse energizes your 12th House of Spirituality, freeing you to go anywhere within your imagination as long as you keep up appearances by continuing to meet your obligations. But if you show any sign of slacking off, you'll lose your freedom to daydream as everyone watches you like a hawk. Acting in a conscientious manner allows you to travel in both worlds without any worries."
gemini,2015-09-27,"Upholding your reputation is tricky business today, even if you want to meet everyone's expectations. Chasing your ambitions for the future is a delightful distraction while the Aries Lunar Eclipse rattles your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes, leaving you bored with the mundane details of the present moment. Nevertheless, following your impulses will probably land you in hot water. Concentrating on a current deadline is a much more practical use of your time now than running down a dream for tomorrow."
cancer,2015-09-27,"You crave immediate acknowledgment from your close friends and family for your impressive list of accomplishments. You might even carry resentment from a recent slight as the reactionary Aries Full Moon Eclipse fires up your 10th House of Public Recognition. Unfortunately, you don't want to compromise and your normally sympathetic demeanor is nowhere to be found. It's healthy to express your feelings as long as you make sure you have your thoughts together before you start sharing your grievances. Keep in mind that others may have more pressing matters on their plate than stroking your ego. Ask for what you need and then move on."
leo,2015-09-27,"You have a sudden flash of inspiration today and want to turn your new strategy into reality as fast as possible. The fiery Aries Lunar Eclipse sends shockwaves through your 9th House of Big Ideas, awakening you from your sleepy dreams with a clear vision of where you want to go. Everything looks good on paper until you start to put your plan into action. Finding satisfaction in your fantasies is the easy part, but you must attend to an endless stream of details if you actually want to manifest the future as you see it."
virgo,2015-09-27,"You might find yourself entangled in an emotionally charged melodrama today, even if you typically do your best to evade such distractions. Although the intensity of the Aries Full Moon Eclipse distresses your 8th House of Deep Sharing, there is also an undeniable adrenaline rush when you momentarily forget about remaining cool and detached. Rather than attempting to avoid this unfamiliar territory, sink into it while you can because your passion will settle back down naturally in the days ahead. Sometimes you have to stir things up to clear the air."
libra,2015-09-27,"Pushy people might get on your nerves today but your annoyance with them could actually be a projection of your own irrepressible urges. The bold Aries Full Moon Eclipse polarizes your 7th House of Relationships, making it difficult to discern subjective feelings from objective ideas. Your distaste toward your own aggressive behavior morphs into your perception of this very same trait in someone else -- where it's easier to criticize. Instead of judging others so severely now, find ways to more fully accept all aspects of yourself. Unconditional love isn't just meant for others."
scorpio,2015-09-27,"You are on a creative streak now, but may worry how long you can keep up this high level of ingenuity. Luckily, you receive a boost of energy from the ardent Aries Lunar Eclipse as it electrifies your 6th House of Work. You don't have to be responsible for everyone else's well-being; you only need to establish a productive routine for yourself. Concentrating your intensity on one task for a little while is more productive than casually meandering through your day without focus. Managing your time wisely is your most critical challenge now; there are only so many hours in the day."
sagittarius,2015-09-27,"It's one thing to be confident, but a laissez-faire approach to a relationship is counterproductive now. Your cavalier attitude could anger a close friend or playmate rather than endearing him or her to you. A spontaneous Aries Full Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Frivolity is usually cause for celebration, but this Lunar Eclipse may be more challenging today if someone resists your party plans or your positive perspective. Instead of only taking your needs into account, expand your vision to include those you love and your heart will thank you for it."
capricorn,2015-09-27,"Although this may be your day off from the daily grind, thoughts of professional responsibilities  still vie for your attention. Instead of focusing on your ambitions, dance with the powerful Aries Full Moon Eclipse as it pumps energy into your 4th House of Home and Family. Re-prioritize your life to balance work with personal time. You Mountain Goats like to climb, but finding equilibrium should be your goal today, even if it means reaching the summit will take a bit longer."
aquarius,2015-09-27,"You might as well set aside your plans and just roll with the unpredictable energy of the day. Your agenda may be an intelligent one, but the fast-acting Aries Lunar Eclipse zaps your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, turning the tables and making your previous plans obsolete. Stubbornly sticking to past assumptions isn't helpful at all. The more flexibility you can exhibit, the easier it is to navigate through the chaos without having a meltdown. Don't let anyone or anything bring you down; your positive outlook changes everything for the better."
pisces,2015-09-27,"It's no surprise that your financial condition is linked to your self-esteem. Money seems scarce when you don't value yourself. Today's enterprising Aries Lunar Eclipse wires your 2nd House of Income, stimulating new ideas for increasing your cash flow. But coming up with a get-rich-quick scheme on the fly doesn't mean that it will work. You may feel frustrated at first if others oppose your ideas. However, external resistance is not a setback; reality is offering you a chance to improve your attitude, modify your plans and reach your goals."
aries,2015-09-28,"Controlling your emotions continues to be an uphill battle today as the Moon moves through your sign and forms disquieting aspects with several planets including warrior Mars. Unfortunately, talking about your feelings may stir up even more tension at first because there's no way to pretend that something is okay when it's not. Regardless of the potential drama, address whatever is bothering you now instead of waiting until the anxiety is even greater. Just make sure that you're not looking for trouble when you share what's on your mind. Stick to the facts for the happiest results."
taurus,2015-09-28,"Someone's provocative words can quickly escalate a simple discussion into a full-blown argument. You are a tough adversary, especially if you're defending a personal belief. Nevertheless, you probably won't convince your opponent that you're right and a conflict will only widen the gulf between you. Take the high road and absolutely avoid confrontation by refusing to partake in a verbal attack. Current differences aren't as significant as they seem; thankfully, this time around interpersonal stress settles down on its own."
gemini,2015-09-28,"Your perceptions may be slightly warped today making it wise to consciously delay an important discussion. Attempting to sidestep a painful topic makes you nervous until a relatively careless comment pushes your buttons and all bets are off. A temper tantrum empowers you to blow off some stream today, but it won't make anyone feel better in the long run. Instead of inadvertently provoking others for all the wrong reasons, set your sarcasm aside and simply speak from your heart. Delving directly into the core of the matter is the most direct route to a peaceful resolution."
cancer,2015-09-28,"You're a force to be reckoned with today, especially if someone tries to play the authority card to gain control over you. At other times you might actually choose to remain quiet and acquiesce to people's demands, but now you're ready to tenaciously fight to maintain your boundaries. It's healthy to let everyone know where you stand as long as you don't take your resistance too far. Claim your power but not at anyone else's expense."
leo,2015-09-28,"You sincerely appreciate the love and support from your friends and family. However, you don't like it when someone meddles in your business, especially if you are adamant about your current goals. Your patience is burning on a short fuse today and your reaction to outside interference may be too swift. Be firm in your demeanor, but keep in mind that breaking rank could further incite unwanted conflict. Take a deep breath and think twice before you respond. There isn't any reason to burn bridges when you still have rivers to cross."
virgo,2015-09-28,"You prefer to have all the details in place, but something can go slightly awry today. Unfortunately, you may be caught off-guard if a friend or coworker leads you down the garden path. Rather than overreacting, practice the art of compassion, instead. In fact, a simple misunderstanding might have set the whole thing into motion. Once you know the source of the error, you can quickly correct it and get your day back on track."
libra,2015-09-28,"It's a wonder that people can be so insistent with pushing their personal agendas that they don't even realize they're being offensive. On the other hand, you're overly concerned that someone else may think you're the one that's being too aggressive. Surprisingly, those closest to you might be much more cooperative if you spend more time and energy describing exactly what you need now. Establishing clear boundaries isn't rude behavior; a little personal space is exactly what's required for healthy relationships."
scorpio,2015-09-28,"You may feel as if you're back into the swing of things now that the Moon is working her way through your 6th House of Routine. Nevertheless, her conjunction with incorrigible Uranus today is anything but a stabilizing influence. Although you might be yearning to try something completely new, it's reassuring to know you can still be successful by falling back on an old habit. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks; the opinions of others are less important than the results of your actions. The proof is in the pudding."
sagittarius,2015-09-28,"A current wave of confidence refuels your freewheeling approach to life, yet you may be jumping the gun and feeling the optimism a few days too soon. It's not that anything is wrong with your present circumstances; it's just that you still have more work to complete before you can harvest the fruits of your labor. Positive thinking is surely a vital part of your current strategy; just don't ignore reality in the process."
capricorn,2015-09-28,"You're tempted to pick up and move somewhere else, even if you must re-evaluate the potential difficulties you might face. Whether or not relocation is even a tiny bit feasible now, unrelenting responsibilities increase your desire to escape. Nevertheless, it's not a great time to make drastic changes that destabilize your domestic life. Instead, resolve minor problems as they occur; think cosmically, act locally."
aquarius,2015-09-28,"Your thoughts are spinning around in circles today, and you simply can't predict how busy you will be for the next few weeks. But even if you are anticipating what's next with all systems on standby, you still can't instantaneously jump forward to where you want to be. You must move into your future step by step, one day at a time, and right now that means clearing any lingering obstacles in your path, real or imagined. A clean slate makes room for your new dreams to come true."
pisces,2015-09-28,"Your self-esteem grows stronger day by day, but you may be so confident now that you take on more than you can manage. It's easier to see the possibilities in each moment than to stick with the boring facts. However, it's not useful to you or anyone else if you forecast blue skies when it's smarter to carry an umbrella. Karma comes around quickly today, so minimize any setbacks by making certain your goals are realistic. Believing in yourself works wonders now as long as your plans are practical and your intentions pure."
aries,2015-09-29,"Hurrying to finish what you already started may be a hopeless cause, but you might have to try anyhow. Or you could be feeling pressured to begin something new while there's still time. Either way, you are driven to act immediately as familiar surges of urgency wash over you. However, you may grow irritated with your own moodiness until the reflective Moon leaves your reactive sign this afternoon. Although allowing time for contemplation is healthy, don't let your uncertainty hijack your day."
taurus,2015-09-29,"Your daydreams may be so shocking now that you're standing on unfamiliar ground. It's as if something is tickling your psyche today, yet it's difficult to decide whether or not you actually like it. You can't tell exactly what the energy is or where it's coming from, but you are inspired nonetheless. Unfortunately, you don't have a clear strategy for applying your current creative genius. Nevertheless, your visions help to inspire you through the days ahead."
gemini,2015-09-29,"You might believe there's no limit to what you can accomplish today, but actually there's only so much that you Twins can juggle at once. Unfortunately, overextending your energies quickly complicates your world now that Mercury is pedaling backwards. You must make difficult choices if you want something of lasting value to come from your current efforts. Setting priorities seems painful at first, but you'll feel a whole lot better once you do. Don't be a jack of all trades and a master of none."
cancer,2015-09-29,"Sticking with just one project is counterintuitive today because your thoughts are running in several directions at once. Nevertheless, your smartest strategy is even less obvious. Rather than making yourself crazy by trying to focus on the most practical tasks at hand, let your fantasies take you where they will. Although a deadline might slip under the radar, others may be quite willing to adapt to your schedule if you ask them. Currently, success is within your reach if you work at your own pace."
leo,2015-09-29,"You Lions have been on the go for quite a while and it feels great if you can grab a catnap for a while. However, the overall cosmic theme isn't about sleeping; it's all about dreaming. Your subconscious is sending powerful messages today, and you may learn something significant about yourself if you take the time to decipher the symbols and break the code."
virgo,2015-09-29,"Although you prefer to sit back and enjoy your day, you quickly grow anxious if you're idle for more than just a few minutes. Logically, you know you can schedule some quality time for yourself, but you keep worrying about all the unfinished work that still needs to be completed. Instead of dreaming about what you would do with all your idle time if you had it, concentrate on your immediate goals for now. Enjoying your time off will be a pleasure if you feel like you earned it."
libra,2015-09-29,You hit the ground running today. You're psyched that you have a lot to do and are eager to get started. But you could bite off a bigger chunk of reality than you can handle with retrograde Mercury stirring up trouble in your sign. Everything seems to require more time and effort than you planned. Don't look expect others to bail you out; just continue to plod along as whatever pace you can. You may be happily surprised by the end of the day when you realize how much you actually accomplished.
scorpio,2015-09-29,"Although your actions are well-intended and you enjoy the appreciation you receive, you still may feel overwhelmed if you assume too many responsibilities now. You might be afraid of the proverbial straw that could break the camel's back -- and the camel is you. But there's no easy way out. Take a deep breath and follow through with your promises to the best of your ability. Thankfully, the cosmos rushes to your rescue and things could work out much better than you expect."
sagittarius,2015-09-29,"There's plenty of work on your plate today and you have enough energy to do whatever is necessary. Your optimism is off the charts, making it increasingly tricky to separate the truth of the situation from your belief that everything will be fine. Don't fall asleep at the wheel of consciousness now or you could wake up to find yourself crashing into reality. There's nothing wrong with positive thinking as long as you accept the facts before you sign on the dotted line."
capricorn,2015-09-29,"Unplanned events require your immediate intervention today. You are known for your organizational abilities, especially in the midst of dealing with minor crises. The problem is that your solutions may defy practical logic now. Make no mistake about it; this is a test and you can pass with flying colors if you trust your feelings and your intuition. Sometimes you must take a leap of faith and trust that the universe will support you."
aquarius,2015-09-29,"Your world seems a bit more settled today than it did yesterday. However, you might not even realize you have passed through the eye of a storm and are coming out the other side now. You are a survivor because your individuality prevents you from losing yourself completely to the confusion of intense cosmic weather. Don't be afraid to fight for what is yours. Take time to reflect on your journey, appreciate your accomplishments and head into the future with a brave heart."
pisces,2015-09-29,"The currents of your emotions may be flowing too strongly for your taste today, especially if someone is making unfair demands on your heart. You might be anxious because you want to stand on solid ground now, but can't discern the facts from your feelings. Don't panic; you'll be fine if you trust the process. Just imagine that you're a surfer riding the waves that arise from the depths of your imagination and you'll come out on top."
aries,2015-09-30,"You may be consciously holding yourself back because you know it's not quite time yet to break free from recently imposed routines. But you are eager for a change, nonetheless, and can't wait forever. It's no problem if you still lack specific plans since the details will fall into place over the next few days. Instead of initiating action today, just imagine what freedom will feel like once it's yours. Fly like an eagle and let your spirit soar."
taurus,2015-09-30,"Although you are confident that your goals are obtainable, you still might be unclear where reality fades into fantasy. You may not even realize that you're dreaming of a future that is beyond your reach. Nevertheless, you can work toward making the most of what you already have by walking in two worlds. One foot is stepping into your dreams and the other is wide awake in the present moment. Ironically, flights of fancy won't make you any less effective and they could even inspire you to greater heights."
gemini,2015-09-30,"You have an admirable-but-unrealistic desire to make everyone in your world happy today. You sincerely want to be of service to others, but you can't just drop your own issues in the process, especially if your intentions are at cross purposes with those around you. Unfortunately, compromise might not be a viable option at this time. Take care of your needs instead of worrying about pleasing the crowd. Sometimes the best thing you can do is acknowledge your differences, accept that which you can't change and move on."
cancer,2015-09-30,"You're surfing emotional waves that are bigger than you've seen in a while and they propel you further than you expect. You're likely to take your feelings seriously as you try to maintain your balance in very tricky circumstances. Nevertheless, the completion of any one specific task may be more elusive than you wish. You grow even more determined than ever to reach the finish line; nevertheless, patience and a healthy sense of humor are your greatest virtues at this time."
leo,2015-09-30,"You are keen on keeping your current commitments but your instincts may be pulling you in an entirely different direction today. Your emotions are in flux, challenging you to stay in touch with your more radical feelings. On the outside, you have everything completely under control but you're working overtime to make it appear that way. Be gentle with yourself; you're as human as everyone else and you don't always have to save the day."
virgo,2015-09-30,"You often seem as cool as a cucumber, but your rational side is nowhere to be found today. People may be disappointed if they believe they can rely on your logical approach to lead the way now. But analytical thinking isn't the only viable method for reaching a sensible conclusion. Sometimes, you must dance to the music you hear inside your head, no matter what others might say. Your intuition holds the keys to your success."
libra,2015-09-30,"An action-packed day at work and home keeps you in perpetual motion, but it's even more hectic within the confines of your mind. But there's no need to hide your thoughts and feelings simply for the sake of convenience. Thankfully, the planets are pushing the energy up toward the surface so it can be expressed. It really doesn't serve any purpose at all to withhold your best ideas from the world. Sharing your plans now attracts the encouragement you need to run with your dreams."
scorpio,2015-09-30,"Even if you think you're fully aware of the emotional dynamics in your immediate environment, you still could be in for a surprise today. Although your romantic life may be very different from your expectations, rest assured this current detour isn't permanent. You are ready to react to the changing circumstances, but don't know which way to turn as your feelings build in intensity. If possible, postpone making any big decisions now; it's best if you can wait this one out until the fog lifts and your clarity returns."
sagittarius,2015-09-30,"It is all too easy to slip into your inner world now without informing anyone of your whereabouts. But even if you don't say anything, someone might still notice your emotional detachment. Be careful about withdrawing too far because you could inadvertently precipitate the melodrama you're trying to avoid. Stopping long enough to consider the feelings of everyone else is the first step to opening up the lines of communication."
capricorn,2015-09-30,"Your ability to visualize the future is one of your greatest assets now. You might even believe you can manifest your dreams, regardless of how many obstacles are in your path. Unfortunately, you have a slightly distorted view of your own capabilities today. Even if the burden of responsibility is on your shoulders, you probably have a few more days before you must make your move. Continue to weigh and balance all the facts at your disposal until things start to make sense."
aquarius,2015-09-30,"You have strived for success long enough and now you want to see tangible results. Although your ideal payoff may still seem far off in the distance, practicing patience goes a long way to calm your nerves today. Uncharacteristic confusion can add discouragement to the picture, but it fades quickly once you stop trying so hard to prove your worth. Luckily, a looming energetic shift brings you closer to your goals if you simply hang in there and keep the faith."
pisces,2015-09-30,Conflicting cosmic messages ask you to focus your attention while simultaneously telling you to loosen your grip on the details. You are ready to jump into the fray yet your key planet Neptune makes it impossible to know what's most sensible in the moment. Considering the alternatives is a prudent course of action as long as you aren't seduced into believing you must choose one or the other today. The trick is to successfully navigate your way between the extremes now until you reach your destination.
aries,2015-10-01,"You may look forward to taking some time off today, but might end up much busier than you ever expected. It's tempting to lazily kick back in the morning, but you could pay a hefty price if you fall behind on your work. Procrastination doesn't do you any favors now; turn your day around by working hard first and then pursuing your own interests once the Moon shifts into versatile Gemini. Life is less stressful when you keep your priorities straight."
taurus,2015-10-01,"Your feelings are still raw and close to the surface today, but you're probably calmer than you were yesterday. It's no problem to take things in stride now, even if you're emotionally dazed and confused. However, you might receive information that conflicts with what you thought to be correct. Instead of being overly concerned about verifying the validity of the conflicting stories, entertain all possibilities as the truth until the facts sort themselves out. Wait for the dust to settle and the answer will be in plain sight."
gemini,2015-10-01,"It may seem like someone is plotting against your every move, but the Moon's shift into adaptable Gemini this afternoon allows you to adeptly maneuver around most of the resistance. Don't overreact before you know what's going on because you could inadvertently turn a figment of your imagination into something real by giving it too much attention today. Instead, just continue putting your best foot forward and let the situation develop on its own. There's no reason to go looking for trouble unless it's knocking at your door."
cancer,2015-10-01,"Following your creative flow feels good today, especially if you're content to work behind the scenes. You may be producing something wonderful, but you don't necessarily need others to see what you're doing yet. Stick to your path without worrying about what anyone else thinks of your current endeavors. You'll receive the recognition you deserve later on when it really counts. Dancing with your muse is a lot more fun now without anyone judging your performance."
leo,2015-10-01,"You begin to let down your guard today, leaving you with the complicated task of integrating your feelings more completely into your life. In some ways, life is simpler when your emotions are neatly tied up in a box, but it doesn't always work out that way. You may be afraid that no one understands your actions now, leading you to pull back from social interactions. Although you must function within your family or community, it's more important to acknowledge what your heart is trying to tell you, no matter what others say. It's your life to live, not theirs."
virgo,2015-10-01,"You feel a mega jolt of energy now that lightning-like Uranus zaps action-hero Mars as he journeys through your sign. People assume you're doing great because they can't help but notice your irrepressible enthusiasm. However, personal issues that are out of everyone else's sight can still negatively impact your day if you try to smile and bury your emotions. Instead of pretending life is perfect today, show real courage and reveal your vulnerability to someone you trust."
libra,2015-10-01,"A hint of worry could lurk behind your gentle smile today, but your self-doubt dissipates when the evocative Moon enters your 9th House of Big Ideas this afternoon. There's no need to change a thing, although you might feel as if your timing is off if you don't react immediately. The best way to overcome your uncertainty is to remember that the details may not be as significant as they seem now. There's no reason to get hung up with what can go wrong in the future if you stick to the simplicity of the present moment."
scorpio,2015-10-01,"You're finally able to breathe easy as the recent eclipse volatility starts to wane. Your emotions may have been trapped behind a dam for too long, yet now the waters are flowing freely again. Nevertheless, don't gloss over any residual blocked feelings because bringing them into awareness will ultimately help you reach satisfaction. Let go of the past once the stuck energy is moving or you won't be able to successfully swim into the future."
sagittarius,2015-10-01,"You might feel as if you're bouncing around in a sea of intense forces that you can't control. You could fritter away time and energy by trying to take charge of your life today, but a smarter tactic is to soften your position and temporarily relax your agenda. However, you don't need to alter your overall direction; just ease the pressure by demonstrating your trust in the wisdom of the cosmos. Being the master of your own destiny includes knowing when to hold on and when to let go."
capricorn,2015-10-01,"You can find your groove and accomplish a great deal today if you remember to enjoy yourself along the way. Although your pace is steady and your resolve unwavering, social connections at work might become more meaningful than your job itself. Don't let important feelings slip into denial; be vigilant about keeping all communications clear and above board. Hiding the truth now multiplies problems later, so share your concerns and then let others do the same. An honest give-and-take dialogue cultivates mutual respect."
aquarius,2015-10-01,"Your social life takes an odd detour now, ultimately revealing a whole new direction. Luckily, it doesn't matter if you can't logically figure out how the variety of pieces fit into place. Although maintaining a flexible attitude isn't always easy for you, especially when you are sure that you know the truth, today it holds the key to your happiness. You will never know where following your intuition will take you unless you suspend your disbelief and surrender to the flow."
pisces,2015-10-01,"Your unwavering commitment to finishing what you start may be so all-consuming now that it becomes counterproductive. Don't take yourself too seriously today, especially if you mistakenly believe that you have no time at all for extracurricular activities. Ironically, you'll accomplish more if you loosen up and focus on maintaining healthy and happy relationships rather than putting more hours into your work. When push comes to shove, love is all that matters."
aries,2015-10-02,"You're cosmically disposed to be a pioneer, bravely exploring unknown territories and eagerly pursuing the rush of doing things for the first time. Today's fidgety Gemini Moon prompts you to pile on even more activities to your already hectic schedule just for the thrill of it. Although you may thrive on blasting off in several different directions at once, narrowing your focus and concentrating on one challenge at a time now enables you to be even more productive in the future."
taurus,2015-10-02,"A realistic assessment of what you need versus what you want produces some pretty interesting results today. You understand that life is less complicated when you get by with just the basics, but you're unwilling to make the adjustments necessary to change your lifestyle. Thankfully, no immediate action is required now; starting with a fresh perspective is enough to make you feel more secure all the way around. Counting your blessings allows you to see how rich you truly are."
gemini,2015-10-02,"Making an important decision can be challenging today because the dualistic Gemini Moon has you seeing double. Even after you make your choice, a single goal morphs into two very distinct possibilities -- just like the mythical Hydra who regrew two more heads each time one was cut off. Fortunately, there's no need to answer every question posed to you now; some dilemmas are better left unresolved. Keep your options open until Mercury turns direct and your clarity returns."
cancer,2015-10-02,"You probably sound more certain today than you actually feel. Although you may be inwardly lost in self-doubt, your coworkers won't realize that anything is wrong. Ironically, you're likely to receive support from others and be more successful professionally if you share your current concerns now, rather than trying to hide your insecurities. Your best policy is to keep the communication channels wide open and hope for the best."
leo,2015-10-02,"Although you Lions often prefer playing in a pack, you might want to venture off on your own today. The truth is you need to maintain your autonomy or you will feel trapped by the very same people you want in your life. Don't sacrifice your individuality just to be accepted and loved. You will likely need more freedom, rather than less, over the days ahead. Be considerate and let others know your plans, but don't give anyone a chance to steal your thunder. Fortune favors the bold."
virgo,2015-10-02,"Maintaining your sense of purpose is a struggle today, even if you have a very clear sense of what you need to do. Nevertheless, circumstances will likely pull you in several directions at once while you prefer to drill down on the details with a singular focus. Simultaneously, responsibilities demand that you spread yourself thinner to cover the workload. You don't do anyone any favors promising more than is humanly possible. Staying within your lane now is best for everyone involved."
libra,2015-10-02,"You may secretly worry that your expectations for the future will be impossible to meet. However, adopting a common sense approach actually enables you to live out your dreams. But this isn't an overnight project; your long-range planning might take months, or even years, to manifest. If you find yourself growing anxious or restless now, remember the old adage, ""Rome wasn't built in a day."" Relax; you have more time than you think to create your perfect life."
scorpio,2015-10-02,"Sometimes you dive into an emotional situation with such abandon that you lose all sense of perspective. However, you're capable of being fully engaged without being hooked by someone else's melodrama today. Your rational approach rewards you with a cool head now, so others may lean on you even more in their times of need. It's an honor to share your wisdom if you don't attempt to control anyone else's life in the process. Your insight is a gift as long as your heart is in the right place."
sagittarius,2015-10-02,"You are a pro at gazing far off into the distance, but sometimes miss seeing what's right under your nose. A close friend or partner may overwhelm you with too much information about something that's occurring now. Although people might go to great lengths to change your opinion, you can't help but think that the current events are merely a distraction from your more evolved perspective. Don't be so quick to judge; instead, acknowledge that you don't have all the answers and remain open to the pearls of wisdom others  can offer you."
capricorn,2015-10-02,"Spending the day talking around the water cooler seems like more fun than actually performing your job today, but idle chatter only leads to major trouble. Thankfully, the loquacious Gemini Moon's visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine is stabilized by the willful Sun, reminding you of your long list of obligations. Nevertheless, it's challenging to settle down if you are busy socializing when you should be focusing on your work. Remember, actions speak louder than words."
aquarius,2015-10-02,"You are buzzing with so many creative ideas today that your innovative thinking could lead you in endless circles. You must slow down and take the time to turn your brilliant thoughts into bold action. However, initiating a new project doesn't ensure success now; you need to follow through on every detail to finish whatever you start. Ultimately, your ambitious intentions are valuable only if you relentlessly keep your eyes on the prize. No one can stop you from achieving your potential except yourself."
pisces,2015-10-02,"There is so much going on around you now that you might attempt to lose yourself in a daydream for a while. Unfortunately, you are involved in too many activities for you to get very far with your escape. In fact, you may be drawn from one project to another, without having enough time to settle into any of them. Instead of working yourself up into a state of high anxiety, remember that this level of noise won't last. In the meantime, set your fantasies aside until you put your priorities in order."
aries,2015-10-03,"The rhythm of your own drumbeat is so loud today that you can't resist dancing to it, following the sound wherever it leads. Happily, your insatiable curiosity is running wild as it uncovers exciting discoveries. Although you aspire to be practical in your approach now, you naturally overextend your energy when given the opportunity. Thankfully, you can improve your chances for success by taking your goals more seriously. Eliminating unnecessary distractions flips the odds in your favor."
taurus,2015-10-03,"You're slightly uneasy with the accelerated pace of events today. It's obvious how your current actions are setting the stage for what will happen next, but there are so many variables to take in account now that it's challenging to keep your head on straight. Your prospects for success are improving, leaving you without any excuse for abandoning your responsibilities. Don't stop fighting for what you want. The impending rewards will likely vanish in thin air if you give up too soon. Passion gets you started while persistence gets the job done."
gemini,2015-10-03,"Your cheerful optimism attracts lovely surprises now, but you must be careful to balance positive affirmations with practical considerations. Although you can tell there is great potential for enjoyment today, the fun and games may have to wait if your Muse is calling. You have a chance to create something beautiful that enriches your spirit; including your friends in your process makes a meaningful experience even more special. Magic happens when you open your heart and share your joy."
cancer,2015-10-03,"A potential creative breakthrough is crackling in  the air today, inspiring you to let go of your previous inhibitions and explode onto the scene with ingenious ideas of your own. Something is radically different about you now and your spontaneous behavior may catch others off guard. Nevertheless, you can't let everyone's expectations rain on your parade; if you feel compelled to take a chance and risk exposure, then this is your moment to shine."
leo,2015-10-03,"Whenever the going gets tough you always bounce right back. The planets infuse you with an extra blast of energy today, adding to your zest for life. But it isn't wise to initiate action if you're only trying to avoid a difficult situation. You still may feel like you're on top of the world because everything seems to be going your way. However, reality will likely disappoint you now if you inflate your hopes too much. Letting a little air out of your bubble ensures that it will not pop."
virgo,2015-10-03,"Your confidence continues to grow stronger and stronger, yet residual negativity could prevent you from freely riding your own waves of enthusiasm. You still believe that you can accomplish something special now if you just go out and give it your absolute best. Fortunately, you have an excellent grasp of the situation and success is at your fingertips. This is not the time for hesitation; no matter what, stay on course until you have the whole world at your feet."
libra,2015-10-03,"You are known to be a people person and typically thrive on your interpersonal interactions. In fact, your discussions with someone else often help you to see yourself more clearly. The feedback you receive today deepens your perspective, but only if you can be receptive to hearing it. An additional point of view increases your current options, so take time to integrate what you learn now before making any important decisions. Keeping an open mind allows you to grow in ways you can't imagine."
scorpio,2015-10-03,"You are such a realist by nature that you know your current enthusiasm won't last. But you're also clever enough to make the most of the good vibrations while you can. Recognition for a job well done is yours for the asking if you're willing to earn it. Although a bit of positive reinforcement won't change the overall trajectory of your life, you still appreciate the support and encouragement along the way. Continue on your journey by taking one step after another. Your sunny outlook and unwavering determination propel you through the many twists and turns ahead."
sagittarius,2015-10-03,"You are playing the lead character in a movie about your own mythical story. In your script, you have morphed into an invincible superhero that won't be stopped by mortal dilemmas. But there is a price to pay for such inflationary thinking and your efforts could be undone by the smallest mundane detail. Fortunately, you can have the best of both worlds today if you consciously choose to walk the middle path. You will accomplish extraordinary feats as long as you remember to keep one foot on the ground at all times."
capricorn,2015-10-03,"A healthy dose of common sense is usually enough to see you through periods of excessive ambition, but you might not be able to keep everything in proportion today. You may be overcome by an impulsive drive to squeeze more out of life in the present moment and are eager to share your good news with everyone. However, you must be careful about spilling secrets to the wrong people; discuss your plans for world domination only on an as-needed basis for now.  As the old military saying goes, ""Loose lips sink ships."""
aquarius,2015-10-03,"Reality may kick up a dust storm today, especially if you're hiding your true intentions. Nevertheless, you can make strong emotional connections if you initiate meaningful communication now instead of wasting time talking about trivialities. Although people admire your open mind, you might not even realize how influential your values are or what precious treasures you bring to a relationship. Let your friends see your vulnerability; they can help you change in ways that are not obvious yet. Your willingness to grow inspires others to do the same."
pisces,2015-10-03,"You have a profound sense of self-assurance that continues to deepen throughout next week. You're motivated to reach your goals and are ready to shift into high gear as quickly as you can. Your friends may think you're out of control now, but you're probably more centered than you appear. You have been considering your next move for a while, but your current excitement overshadows your previous planning. Just do what makes the most sense to you in the present moment and let the chips fall as they may."
aries,2015-10-04,"Although you can slow down and enjoy the scenery today -- an unusual occurrence for you fast-moving Aries -- you still may resist easing up on the gas pedal. However, you have been racing at high speed for a while and could be in danger of exhausting your fuel if you don't stop running now. Take time to replenish your resources and recharge your batteries while you have the opportunity. After a short break from the mayhem, you will be ready to fire on all cylinders when the light turns green."
taurus,2015-10-04,"Maternal feelings toward someone you love may be overwhelming today, especially if you aren't the warm and fuzzy type. Nurturing others can be a healing experience for you, but you must make a concerted effort to push past your fears of rejection. But don't take care of anyone just so you can feel good about yourself. Reexamine your motives to make sure your heart is in the right place. Honesty is an essential ingredient found in healthy relationships."
gemini,2015-10-04,"Happiness begins at home by learning how to honor your heart's desires. You're often quick to say the right thing at the right time in order to receive the approval of others. Stop trying to elicit a particular response now and simply follow your own dreams, instead. Putting your needs first is mandatory today; ironically, being kind to yourself also sets the tone to deepen the connections between you and those you love. Your authenticity shines like a beacon in the dark."
cancer,2015-10-04,"You're sitting on pins and needles today but can't find the words to easily express the feelings you want to share. Although the Moon's visit to moody Cancer agitates your emotions, there are some serious self-restraint issues coming to light now. Keep in mind that you're probably being harder on yourself than is necessary. Stay aware of the facts, but save your critical judgments for another day. Treating yourself gently is a wonderful place to start."
leo,2015-10-04,"Your fantasy life is spellbinding now with the evocative Moon illuminating your 12th House of Imagination. Nevertheless, keep one foot anchored in the real world so you don't get lost in the fog of the mystical realms. You have powerful feelings that you want to explore in the privacy of your mind today, especially since letting others in on your secrets doesn't seem appropriate yet. Trust your intuition to know when it's the right time to share your insights. Inspiration flowers when you look within."
virgo,2015-10-04,"Sometimes when you're participating in a group function you are hesitant to say what's on your mind. Normally, you don't have a problem talking to your partner or your boss in private; however, it's difficult to express yourself in a public forum. Gather your courage and speak your piece today. You don't need to disclose all the little details, but rest assured that every word you share will be taken seriously. If you believe in your message, others will, too."
libra,2015-10-04,"You naturally want to behave in a socially acceptable manner, but something might prevent you from telling the truth now. You are quietly observing your feelings as they change, but haven't said anything yet because you don't want to upset the status quo. However, you can get away with sharing what's been bugging you as long as you do so with a healthy dose of sensitivity. Demonstrate how much you care in a way that allows you to say more and offend less."
scorpio,2015-10-04,"You might be wondering about your future, but you don't want others to know about your current worries. Even your fantasies may be related to your career or community aspirations now, rather than your personal life. It's all too easy to get emotionally worked up about issues of social injustice today. Your opinions are so strong that your passion could erupt at an inopportune moment. State your truth, but tone it down just a touch so your message isn't lost in the drama of the moment."
sagittarius,2015-10-04,"Oddly enough, your unexpressed feelings may be the most significant ones now because your idealism can attract out-of-this-world dreams. Actually, the subtle signals you're receiving might not even be on the radar of perception. Don't question which dimension the messages are coming from. Just listen carefully, even if you aren't sure what you're hearing. Write down every idea that pops into your awareness; your comprehension continues to grow and the big picture will be clear soon enough. Don't rule anything out too soon when you should be opening doors, not closing them."
capricorn,2015-10-04,"The truth is that it's not all about your plans today; in fact, it's about everyone else's. Or at least that's how it seems. But someone is withholding information and the lack of communication creates a tense situation. The first step is to look to your own issues and acknowledge your personal contribution to the current confusion. There are a variety of scenarios that could play out now, depending on your reaction. You can change your outer world most effectively by transforming your inner world first."
aquarius,2015-10-04,"An odd feeling of anxiety rises from the depths today, creating a dilemma that stems from your intense desire for love and acceptance. Of course, nearly everyone wants to feel needed, but you complicate matters by cleverly dancing around emotional interdependence. There is no one-size-fits-all answer; instead of seeking the perfect solution, try to be comfortable with every side of an issue. Others will be more appreciative of your feelings when you are flexible enough to recognize their points of view, too."
pisces,2015-10-04,"Your emotions seem to be growing more serious these days, prompting you to pull away from the crowd. However, your withdrawal doesn't mean you are antisocial, even if you yearn for some quality time to yourself now. However, you don't need to put distance between you and a person you adore. In fact, this is an ideal day to pursue a romantic interest or create something beautiful. Eliminate the extraneous noise, but reach out to connect with someone special. Love makes the world go round."
aries,2015-10-05,Expressing feelings that you might normally keep to yourself could destabilize a significant relationship today. Your inclination is to jump right in because you are all fired up about a particular issue-- even though you will likely encounter an icy reception from your audience. Tread carefully because your outburst may be motivated by fear instead of by love. Focus on what must be said now and save the rest for another day once your emotions have returned to normal. You can be a formidable force for good if you wield your words wisely.
taurus,2015-10-05,"You may feel slightly contentious today and are quick to squabble with someone, if necessary, on your quest for personal satisfaction. Your ruling planet Venus is under intense pressure from provocative Pluto now, heightening your perceptions and activating your desires. Nevertheless, think again before you risk your emotional stability just to prove your point. Consider temporarily standing down until you can regain your cool practicality, especially if your sense of urgency is great. Channel your angst into your work and you will have something to be proud of at the end of the day."
gemini,2015-10-05,"Your inquiring mind wants to know what drives others to seek power at work or in love. You may be ready to delve into the mysterious world of hidden feelings, a place that you often choose to avoid. However, you're willing to overcome your resistance now, even if you shudder at the thought of what you might encounter. You are on the right track and will surely feel a great sense of relief once you uncover the truth. Shining the light of awareness into the shadows satisfies your curiosity and enlightens your soul."
cancer,2015-10-05,"Strong emotional currents draw you into unfamiliar waters today, and you aren't necessarily a willing participant. Your attempts to maintain a healthy outlook can help you keep your head above the waves, yet you still might scare yourself now by sinking into the darkness of your subconscious. There's no reason to fight the process when positive change is your reward. Once you complete your deep-diving exercises, resurface and use your new awareness to create the life of your dreams."
leo,2015-10-05,"Managing your emotions is like an unsolvable puzzle today, especially if you're stuck in one particular way of viewing intimacy in relationships. Your love life might feel like an emotional minefield instead of the pleasure palace it's meant to be. As difficult as it is to see now, the real conflict is within and not with anyone else. Thankfully, everything can change for the better if you are willing to shift your perspective in a positive direction. A grateful heart is a powerful heart."
virgo,2015-10-05,"Relationship dynamics are particularly complicated now, especially if there are money problems in the mix. Keep in mind that resolution is easier once you accept the truth you previously tried to deny. Ironically, stress works in your favor today, motivating you to initiate overdue changes. Don't get sidetracked by your need to be right; no one wins if you choose to play the blame game. Fortunately, you can increase your chances to heal a current rift if you are willing to forgive without expecting anything in return."
libra,2015-10-05,"Your desire for relationship stability finally gives way to the obvious need for change. Unfortunately, verbal communication might not solve all your problems because your emotions can be so passionate now that others question the validity of your perspective. Detach yourself from any desired outcome by simply stating your case and then letting it go. No matter what occurs next, your ability to quickly adapt to the changing circumstances is more valuable than clinging to your past hopes and wishes. There's no time like the present to grow."
scorpio,2015-10-05,"You're resigned to gamble on your heart today, especially if you think it's necessary to get what you want. You may feel as if you've run out of options and have no alternatives at your disposal. Romantic Venus is frazzled by fierce Pluto, provoking the expression of intense emotions. You're living in the realm of extremes now, with very little gray between the black and the white. Take into account that your raging desires are distorting your clarity. Stay away from issuing any ultimatums and keep all channels of communication open if you want the relationship to last."
sagittarius,2015-10-05,"Your unspoken fears could have more of an influence on your relationships now than you realize. Nevertheless, you are driven to tackle complex issues, even when your common sense says there are no quick answers. The current challenges hold great potential for growth, but you can't just take the easy way out. You have a better chance of seeing things in their true light today if you try being less of an optimist and more of a realist. Exploring uncharted emotional territory might be scary but it is a worthwhile journey, nonetheless, if you learn to listen with your heart."
capricorn,2015-10-05,"It's not appropriate in the current emotional environment to apply the same managerial skills you might use to handle your business affairs. Your attempts at controlling the energetic flow could block the raw feelings that need to be expressed today. This is not the right time to be overly demanding or stubbornly stoic; instead, acknowledge any negativity, shame or guilt that may be clouding the picture. Revealing your vulnerability is the key to a positive transformation."
aquarius,2015-10-05,"Power struggles are likely if your dreams of the future differ from those closest to you. It requires extra work to find common ground today and the emotional discomfort that stems from social pressure tempts you to retreat from intense interactions. However, avoidance tactics won't lead to harmony in the future. Fortunately, the resistance dissipates if you move purposely into the uncertainty without trying to force your ideas on anyone else. Sometimes direct confrontation is the only way to clear the air."
pisces,2015-10-05,"Although it might seem as if you're losing something dear to your heart today, nothing is actually being taken from you. It's just that relationship dynamics are shifting and you don't want to end up with the short end of the stick. However, you may be overreacting due to old fears or pointless insecurities. Don't waste your energy fighting against changes you can't control. Expressing your appreciation for others is the fastest method for calming the volatile energy and reestablishing your center of gravity."
aries,2015-10-06,Your life path may grow even more convoluted if you are struggling to establish your place in a significant relationship. It seems like whatever you choose to do seems to go against the grain now. You're not purposefully trying to be difficult or rebellious; you simply want to be true to your heart. Don't let anyone talk you out of following your instincts. Trusting your inner voice today will lead you in the right direction as long as you don't let your pride stand in the way.
taurus,2015-10-06,"You might feel as if you're engaged in a classic battle between light and dark today as an associate or a casual acquaintance tries to smear your reputation. It's not easy to bring up certain topics for discussion, but you can't afford to let them slide now, in case someone gets the wrong impression. Awareness rather than denial clears the most direct path toward a peaceful resolution. Maintain your integrity at all costs and everyone will see who is telling the truth."
gemini,2015-10-06,"Your creative urges can generate plenty of mischief today as you search for ways to push people's emotional buttons. Ironically, you don't want to engage in a serious discussion about your work; you're looking to provoke reactions. However, you could be in denial about how controversial your artistic expression is now and might even be taken aback by the intense response you receive. Don't make matters worse by trying to avoid a meaningful conversation. Talking about your true intentions gives others the chance to know the real you."
cancer,2015-10-06,"You prefer to hide out and let the world pass you by now that Pluto is squaring the Sun in your 4th House of Roots. However, you also might need to face your fears about the possibility of failure. Retreating to the safety of your home can help you gain a better perspective on the weeks ahead. Instead of falling victim to self-doubt and worry, put all your energy toward visualizing your success. Once you have a clear picture of your bright and shiny future, you can step out of your shell and shine."
leo,2015-10-06,"In the big scheme of things, today's dramas are not as significant as you may think. The Moon's return to your sign always stirs up suppressed feelings, making everything seem more intense -- and this time is no exception. However, a serious confrontation may develop from a rather trivial disagreement. Instead of allowing the energy to escalate into a major conflict, you can contain it early on in the process if you have the courage to speak your truth clearly. Make your point succinctly and then move on to something different."
virgo,2015-10-06,"You may be short on time, energy or money today as dark Pluto squares the impulsive Aries Sun in your 2nd House of Resources. You might overcompensate if you think you mismanaged a project now, bolting ahead early in the day. You're not sure why anyone would stand in your way, yet your eagerness could stir up resistance from others. Stick to your position and don't push the panic button yet. A thorough reevaluation of your goals now leads you back to the road to success."
libra,2015-10-06,"A disagreement in a personal or business relationship today raises questions that have no easy answers. Instead of trying to force a resolution, seek common ground instead. Ironically, if you can understand each other's point of view, your differing perspectives might actually provide inspiration. Keep in mind that you're on an emotional roller-coaster ride today so beware that you're prone to overreact. Take a deep breath and give everyone a break, including yourself."
scorpio,2015-10-06,"You want to slip into the shadows to escape from your responsibilities as a creative square from evolutionary Pluto activates the Sun in your 12th House of Fantasy. You realize that challenging times are on the horizon, so you're inclined to conserve your energy. Nevertheless, you seem to gain steam as you start to anticipate the future. Relinquish some of your downtime to complete as many chores as possible so you have less to do later on. You can overcome nearly any obstacles once you put your mind to it."
sagittarius,2015-10-06,"Put your best foot forward at work and at social events to make the most of today's profound cosmic energy. Remain open to an unexpected turn of events, even if it pushes your buttons at first. Rather than trying to influence a situation that's beyond your control now, change your response to it. Unfortunately, you're not in charge of everything, but you are fully responsible for your behavior. Your reaction sets the tone for everyone else."
capricorn,2015-10-06,"You might think it's not fair that you make an extra effort to keep an open mind while someone else maintains such a rigid perspective. The bad news is this energetic imbalance leaves little room for compromise. Still, you're willing to talk about your feelings now if the other party is agreeable to an honest dialogue. The first step is to discuss the larger issue of negotiation to ensure everyone agrees that winning an argument is less important than cooperating for the good of all. Leaving egos at the door is the fastest way to cultivate peace."
aquarius,2015-10-06,"Although you can see the flashing red light approaching, you still might not heed the warning. You're so impatient now that you're ready to step on the gas before you even know where you're going. But your long-term thinking runs into more immediate concerns if your day brings an unwarranted surprise. Even if you want to focus on the future, you're better off paying attention to what's happening this moment before you crash and burn."
pisces,2015-10-06,"You have an abundance of excellent ideas you would like to put into action, and as the day progresses you are able to zero in on the best ones. Your power to concentrate is strengthened today and you may find yourself dredging up forgotten memories. You could be surprised by what you discover from your persistent digging. However, you can emerge from this process with stronger values and higher self-esteem If you keep an open mind and continue to trust those who have earned your confidence."
aries,2015-10-07,"Your key planet Mars is engaged in a cosmic tug of war with otherworldly Neptune, spinning you into a parallel universe before you know it. You might even slip on an imaginary banana peel, leaving you dazed and wondering if you should even bother getting up now. Remember, you are a fearless warrior; you're not going to take this disruption without fighting back. Stand up, dust your bruised ego off, and make a new plan that will leave everyone shaking their heads in amazement. Conquer the enemy within, and you will be a winner for life."
taurus,2015-10-07,"You could waste too much time and energy worrying about the future, especially since the conclusions you draw are probably built upon incorrect assumptions. Your senses are unreliable now because you can't help but project your fantasies onto the current events, creating a loss of objectivity. Enjoy the movie your mind is directing today, but remember it's a work of fiction based on your interpretation and not a true documentary. Thankfully, your imagination contains a treasure trove of creative ideas that you can use successfully as long as you don't mix them up with the facts."
gemini,2015-10-07,"You might sound confident when you share your plans with your friends or coworkers today, but it may just be a clever decoy to cover up your ambivalence. Don't make decisions now just to placate others, even if you believe you're running out of time. Avoid finalizing your schedule because cloudy Neptune can mess up even the simplest agenda for the next few days. In the meantime, you never know what your dreams will reveal if you let your thoughts roam far and wide. Albert Einstein wrote, ""The true sign of intelligence is not knowledge, but imagination."""
cancer,2015-10-07,"You are raring to show your colleagues how you can take charge and run the show. You're highly motivated now, confident that little can stop you on your road to success. But you may lose your concentration and temporarily succumb to your insecurities if you move too fast. Paradoxically, you will likely excel as a leader today if you don't push your crew so hard. A gentle but tenacious approach is more successful than attempting to set the world ablaze. Holding the reins with a light touch is essential to winning everyone over to your cause."
leo,2015-10-07,"You may believe you've lost your fighting edge today as nebulous Neptune dissipates the energy of macho Mars. It's not that your defensive skills are diminished; it's just that you're inclined to engage with people in a more subtle manner now. Additionally, your intuitive radar is on target with the reflective Moon camping out in your sign. An adversary might not even realize that you made a power move, but you can be as effective as a ninja warrior, winning a duel without ever drawing your sword."
virgo,2015-10-07,"Putting your finger on the origin of a problem is nearly impossible today, yet you feel certain that you're close to finding a significant piece of the puzzle. You can sense that a major energetic shift is drawing near, but you're not quite ready to let go of your old agenda yet. Even if you're itching to begin your next adventure, hold on a while longer until you gather more information about your future mission. Waiting isn't easy when you are pursuing perfection, but your success depends on getting off to a proper start."
libra,2015-10-07,"Facts and figures go in one ear and right out the other today. You hear the words, but just can't seem to retain any data because your mind is working in the mythical realm of symbols and not the rational realm of details. Luckily, your current fascination with the power of dreams does not put you at a disadvantage. Decisions you make based on intuition are just as valid now as someone else's choice determined by analysis. Sometimes a feeling in the pit of your stomach tells you more than all the logic in the world."
scorpio,2015-10-07,"You know that participating in a group activity will nourish your soul, but you're afraid of losing your personal space in the process. Balancing your social commitments with the amount of time you spend in solitude can mean the difference between frustration and satisfaction today. You need some time alone in order to explore your creative urges now, but you're also drawn to connecting with others. Giving yourself permission to jump back and forth between these two worlds offers you the best chance for finding happiness."
sagittarius,2015-10-07,"Your unquenchable penchant for adventure could get the best of you today as you obsess about embarking on a once-in-a-lifetime journey to an exotic destination. Unfortunately, delusional Neptune is tugging on action-hero Mars, making it wiser to entertain fantasies now than to go anywhere at all. Nevertheless, confusing your hopes with reality will leave you stuck in your tracks. Sometimes dreaming is the best way to travel when you're needed at home. Your imagination is a vast universe all on its own."
capricorn,2015-10-07,"You may feel as if you're on an amusement park ride that's messing with your center of gravity today -- and you don't like it one bit. You're not happy wasting valuable time because you have too many important things to do. You long to reestablish your balance and plant both feet firmly on the ground. You are not one to take kindly to someone else controlling your life, even if it's just for a spin on the tilt-a-whirl. Nevertheless, practicing adaptability is healthier now than resisting that which you cannot change; you might be surprised at how fun it is not to be the one calling the shots all the time."
aquarius,2015-10-07,"Encountering an overly optimistic person could put you in a grouchy mood today when you realize you've been sold a bill of goods. However, the fault may not lie with anyone else; strangely enough, others might be telling the truth. Mixing up your desires with reality is all too easy now. However, there's no free lunch when it comes to love or money, even though assertive Mars is activating fantasy-prone Neptune in your 2nd House of Income. Scale back your assumptions and remember you must earn rewards the old-fashioned way; there's no substitute for realistic goals and hard work when it comes to achieving your dreams."
pisces,2015-10-07,"Someone may give you specific directions today, but you're still confused about which way you're supposed to go. Maybe the communication is muddled, or, perhaps, you have fixed ideas about how to reach your goal. Unfortunately, you can jeopardize a healthy working relationship unless you cooperate with others. Remembering there are multiple paths to every destination saves you from feeling frustrated when you realize you've taken a detour. Life's greatest lessons are often handed to you when you least expect it."
aries,2015-10-08,"You believe you know exactly what you want in the love department today, but your desires are not as clear as you think. You tend to idealize your attractions now, which can be a lot of fun as long as you don't try to connect them directly to reality. In fact, too many concrete expectations hinder your current journey. However, going with the flow may reward you with a lovely experience that has long-lasting consequences. Follow your heart and see who you encounter along the way."
taurus,2015-10-08,"You may misinterpret an emotional situation today, especially if you aren't paying rapt attention to every word. The dynamics of a relationship are shifting and you're not sure if you know the entire truth when it comes to someone else's feelings. Whether or not your concerns are warranted, you can gain some comfort by asking questions to find out what others expect from you. However, there's no need to panic, even if you're treading on shaky ground. Just roll with the confusion until the path straightens out and you can determine your new direction."
gemini,2015-10-08,"Although you might think you expressed your needs well enough for people to understand, they still don't have a clue as to what you want. Your words are easily misconstrued today because you don't believe it's necessary to explain the obvious. However, you can be much more convincing now if you unfold your story gradually in bite-sized pieces that others can handle. Honesty is the best policy for everyone involved; playing guessing games isn't fun when your heart is on the line."
cancer,2015-10-08,"Your schedule can suddenly fall apart today if you don't allow enough time for everything that needs to be accomplished. You may not be as prepared as you prefer now because people aren't sharing their expectations with you. Instead of muddling your way through the uncertainty now, ask pointed questions to find out what others want. Your friends and associates might surprise you with their pragmatic answers, saving your day if you're willing to take their advice. Listen more than you speak for the best results."
leo,2015-10-08,"Your dreams seem so amazingly real now that you could be living in a bubble of fantasies without even knowing it. Facts are shaded by your thoughts and feelings today, and it's tricky to separate objective perceptions from subjective opinions. The truth is that the potential for creating more meaning in your life grows stronger when your intuitive visions are integrated into your reality. Your imagination, intelligence and heart each play an integral part in illuminating your star."
virgo,2015-10-08,"Normally, you're way ahead of the curve when it comes to managing the details of complex projects and keeping everything in order. Although sweet Venus and the responsive Moon shift into your rational sign today, you may be wiser to save the critical analysis and hard work for another day. Relax for a change; give yourself permission to space out, instead of trying to limit your thoughts strictly to the mundane world. Your imagination is your greatest asset now; don't be afraid to use it."
libra,2015-10-08,"You grow more introspective today as the Moon, along with your key planet Venus, takes up residence in your 12th House of Privacy. If you find yourself in the middle of a crowded room, you can still withdraw into your imagination while appearing as socially astute as ever. Thankfully, you don't need to isolate yourself in order to do your inner work. Your natural ability to offset one reality with another empowers you to pursue contemplation while still playing a vital role in the community."
scorpio,2015-10-08,"You have a specific plan in mind that you want to share with your friends now, but your work might not give you the personal freedom you need to do what you want. Obviously, you aren't one to run out on your responsibilities, yet you can rearrange your schedule to your advantage today without negatively impacting anyone else. Following through on your word is crucial to maintaining your reputation, but so is pursuing your dreams."
sagittarius,2015-10-08,"Conditions on the home front can temporarily derail your ambitions, but they aren't your biggest problem now. Nothing is as it appears to be, and it's challenging to gauge the relative importance of a particular thought. Taking a simple idea and turning it into an overly complicated strategy won't make it any more effective. Let ""less is more"" be your mantra to keep you on the straight and narrow path. Misunderstandings that come to light in the next few days will make you glad that you strive for simplicity today."
capricorn,2015-10-08,"You may grow frustrated if you can't subdue your desires now, especially if they distract you from previous commitments. There are days when you industrious Goats can magically build the very same roads you travel on. However, today's energy is meant for exploring territories that are off the beaten track. Paradoxically, it might be prudent to meander around, knowing that you'll be back on the highway and heading toward your destination again before you know it. As Tolkien reminds us, ""Not all those who wander are lost."""
aquarius,2015-10-08,"Your logic seems sound enough to guide your way, but you might not be projecting a ton of confidence today. People can see your kinder and gentler side as your hidden emotions slip out through the cracks in the walls of your defenses. Instead of fighting your softness, consciously let those you trust inside your otherwise impenetrable shell. Sometimes it's necessary to be the strong and silent type; however, it's more important now just to be real."
pisces,2015-10-08,"Falling in love with a fleeting vision, a spiritual calling or a beautiful person is all too easy today. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to tell the difference between fact and fiction when it comes to your affections. Don't try to figure out what's happening now; just enjoy the experience for what it's worth. Untangle the threads in the tapestry of life on another day when things make more sense. The truth is reality and fantasy can blend into a magical moment that breaks open your heart if you're willing to believe in the impossible."
aries,2015-10-09,"Lowering your defenses isn't all that easy because people may seem verbally aggressive for no reason today. Conversations might get stuck in the middle of nowhere while messenger Mercury stops to turn direct in your 7th House of Relationships. However, your heightened sensitivity might provoke you to misinterpret someone's friendly advice as criticism of your position. Don't take everything so personally; being more flexible in your thinking will help lighten your load. If you can't say something nice in return, don't say anything at all."
taurus,2015-10-09,"Your thoughts are so singularly focused on the details of a project today that you can lose sight of the overall picture. Although your undivided attention to little things might go unnoticed, it could actually save the day. Nevertheless, you may drive others crazy with your unforgiving perfectionism now. Remember, progress will become more obvious as clever Mercury gains momentum in the days ahead. Don't set aside those goals that are closest to your heart, but be wise enough to keep everything in proper perspective until everyone is on the same page."
gemini,2015-10-09,"Your friends may not offer you the support you expected today, but their concerns are probably for your own good. It's not that there's anything wrong with your ideas; it's just your enthusiasm might be distorting your sense of proportion. Whatever commitments you make now will need to be scaled back in the days ahead. Remember, your good intentions won't necessarily overrule any laws of nature. There are only so many hours in a day and your positive attitude can only take you so far."
cancer,2015-10-09,"You might believe you have to justify your existence today, but living up to someone else's expectations isn't as important now as being true to yourself. Instead of rushing ahead and impulsively trying to make everyone feel more comfortable, let others take responsibility for themselves. Of course, you can still act with kindness; just be sure to do your own emotional housekeeping before cleaning up for anyone else. Real change starts at home."
leo,2015-10-09,"You could run around in circles chasing your tail today, yet end up feeling like you didn't accomplish  anything at all. Trickster Mercury's direct turn in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment keeps you busy with one distraction after another. Nevertheless, you can reduce your frustration by simply considering the consequences before you start moving in multiple directions. Exercising a dash of self-restraint might be enough to put a more positive spin on the weekend ahead."
virgo,2015-10-09,"Be careful what solutions you are selling today because you might easily convince someone that you know what's best, even if you don't. You are so sure of your logic you could even make a snap decision about buying something you don't need. Ask someone you trust for advice, rather than just defending your choices. But soliciting another opinion is only the first step; you must actually listen to the feedback you receive before you finalize a purchase. Demonstrate your intelligence by admitting when you don't have all the answers."
libra,2015-10-09,"It's time to get to work and set things right, especially if you didn't accomplish all that you intended over the past three weeks while chatty Mercury retrograded in your sign. You're finished talking about what you need to do; today you must deliver the goods. Don't fall prey to someone else's harsh judgment or your own self-criticism. Your words are influential, but ultimately, it's your actions that count the most. Roll up your sleeves and show everyone who's the boss."
scorpio,2015-10-09,"Although your fantasies have led you into new territory, spinning your wheels of logic helps you untangle a sticky situation today. You are in a time of transition now that rational Mercury is turning direct in your 12th House of Imagination. Whatever you do, don't give up if the answers to complex questions are not readily apparent. Your honorable intentions combined with your infamous persistence should clear the way for effective action. You can still be a huge success story without being the smartest person on the block."
sagittarius,2015-10-09,"You might feel as if you recently received the bad end of a deal. It appears that others are getting off easy now while you are paying the price for your hasty decision. But don't worry about past mistakes since talkative Mercury finally ends its retrograde phase today, enabling you to express yourself with a newly found clarity. Think first and then say exactly what's on your mind; you may not notice an immediate change, but your words will set you free to fly to new heights."
capricorn,2015-10-09,"You aren't as overwhelmed as everyone else seems today, even though your feelings are bouncing around in the changing tides, too. You possess a sound sense of your career path, yet aren't surprised by the current resistance you encounter. Calmly observing your reactions to someone who tries to exert their authority is more constructive than responding impulsively now and regretting it later. Allow your emotions to settle down before sharing your opinion, or you might just complicate matters even more. Discretion is the better part of valor."
aquarius,2015-10-09,"You may have watched your plans fall apart in slow motion as circumstances changed substantially over the past three weeks. Thankfully, mischievous Mercury is done with its retrograde through your 9th House of Big Ideas and today's turnaround can send you off in an exciting new direction. It might take a few days to capture a precise picture of what went wrong and to formulate a successful strategy, but don't get discouraged now. You should be back on your feet and raring to go soon enough; focus on the positives and everything will be alright."
pisces,2015-10-09,"You are itching for forward movement as you put a rather ambitious plan into motion. However, it may be more difficult than you imagined to get along with others now, especially if their goals are vastly different from yours. Unfortunately, your current impatience won't help the situation improve any faster. Luckily, you should excel at your endeavors over the next few days as your thinking grows sharper, enabling you to outmaneuver the competition. Slow and steady wins the race."
aries,2015-10-10,"Although you may think you're at a turning point today, it's really more of a readjustment to your regular routine. No matter which way you go, you could run into a roadblock that prevents you from continuing in the same direction. But it's not necessary to abruptly change course; instead, shift your internal radio to a mellower station. Try not to be so demanding now. Pushing less can make everyone happier, including yourself. Magic happens when you're busy appreciating the music you hear at this very moment."
taurus,2015-10-10,"You might wonder if relationships are worth all the headaches they seem to bring these days. Love doesn't flow so easily when sensual Venus is stressed by sobering Saturn. Nevertheless, you must put in extra work now if you want romance in your life. Creating structure for a partnership to grow isn't all fun and games. But if you withdraw today, pleasure will be harder to find in the near future. Opening your heart doesn't come with a guarantee, but without the risk there is no reward."
gemini,2015-10-10,"You are normally quick-footed and light-hearted, no matter who is raining on your parade. However, you're obsessed with doing the right thing now, and this current attraction to perfection prevents you from fully enjoying yourself. You could be afraid that you will lose whatever relationship stability you've gained, prompting you to obstinately stand your ground today. Unfortunately, your resistance creates the opposite effect of what you desire. Staying in motion helps the current stress to pass; a rolling stone gathers no moss."
cancer,2015-10-10,"You wish you could pull your heart safely back behind a thick wall of protection today. After all, you don't want to get carried away by the tides of change that are washing onto the shores of your awareness again. You might think you have lost your chance to take action, but this assumption isn't true. You needn't sink into feelings of self-defeat. The universe is simply giving you time to tie up a few emotional loose ends before launching into the next cycle of work. The less baggage you carry, the easier it is to move into the future unencumbered. The lighter your load, the happier your heart."
leo,2015-10-10,"You are regaining lost clarity on a recurring relationship issue and feel the need to make a dramatic gesture now. But instead of moving closer to someone special, you may require more separation, rather than connection. Although you have great potential to mend a rift that's been bothering you for a while, you need to reveal your vulnerability in order for healing to occur. Achieving true intimacy might take extra effort, but you must work for those things you truly want."
virgo,2015-10-10,"Bothersome domestic issues are popping up now, possibly indicating that you have recently neglected your responsibilities. But your frustration grows because you don't want to cut into your busy day to deliver on your promises. You could have a hard time gauging what you need to do, which makes you even less eager to try anything at all. Remember, it may take a few days before you're really in the swing of things since your key planet Mercury just turned direct. There' no reason to rush. Be gentle with yourself; everything will get done in time."
libra,2015-10-10,"You might not feel as supported by others as you wish today. Your ruling planet, Venus, is under serious stress as she squares off with austere Saturn, and you could experience the brunt of this tension and a sense of isolation. Old abandonment issues may resurface if someone who loves you isn't immediately available now. Thankfully, you can move beyond playing the role of a victim if you are willing to remember the past and then let it go. Be your own best friend and don't allow your history to define you when you can embrace the future, instead."
scorpio,2015-10-10,"Your recent optimistic tune regarding your social life could fade into the blues today. Keeping the weight of your worries to yourself only makes matters worse, yet it's challenging to find the right person to trust with your fears. As much as you need to talk about your feelings now, it's tough to explain complex yet subtle issues. Oddly enough, the key to increasing your self-esteem may come from being emotionally transparent. Your friends are willing to lend a sympathetic ear if you give them half a chance."
sagittarius,2015-10-10,"You're resigned to work hard for what you want, but you expect others to acknowledge your efforts. Unfortunately, you might feel as if you're spinning your wheels in a relationship without achieving any emotional traction. Pushing harder or going faster seems to have no noticeable influence on the current situation. But ultimately, a personal setback isn't a sign of failure today; it's a necessary delay for a valid reason. Turn off the engine and let your desires cool down before you try again. Paradoxically, learning the lesson of patience now enables you to find lasting contentment in the near future."
capricorn,2015-10-10,"Of course, you want to have your share of fun, but you can't ignore your long list of chores without dire consequences. Wrapping up old business needs to be your number one concern because new challenges are looming on the horizon. Good times will have to wait as sweet Venus brushes up against your ruling planet, stern Saturn. The more effort you give your work now, the more relaxed you'll feel throughout the rest of the weekend. Don't put off until tomorrow what you can do today."
aquarius,2015-10-10,"Walking away from your work is not as easy as it sounds today, making it difficult to accept the lovely social invitations that are dangling in front of you. Unfortunately, it seems as if nothing you do alleviates your current sense of alienation. If you must postpone a special event, remember that this isn't a permanent cancellation. Taking care of previous obligations needs to be your top priority now. The sooner you finish your business, the sooner you can join in the fun."
pisces,2015-10-10,"The heaviness of what you don't know lurks right at the edges of your awareness today. Obviously, you can succumb to your uncertainty and steer clear of emotional encounters in the outer world. Or you could face a scary issue and cautiously overcome your instinctive resistance to treading on unfamiliar ground. The truth is your fear may have little to do with what's actually going on. The more light you shine in hidden places, the more confident you will feel about the direction of your life."
aries,2015-10-11,"A friend or coworker appears to have all the answers today, even if you aren't asking any questions. Although it's wonderful to receive help when you need it, too much meddling is bothersome, especially if others act like they know more about your life than you do. Nevertheless, blowing your cool won't improve the situation. Instead, acknowledge everyone's good intentions while gently informing them that you'll request assistance on an as-needed basis. Establishing your independence is instrumental to your happiness."
taurus,2015-10-11,"You're psyched about taking the next step on a big project, but first you must complete unfinished business before moving ahead with your plans. You can sense you're on the edge of something significant today, but you're not sure where to begin. Ironically, there are so many alternatives now that you need to eliminate the distractions before you can figure out how to reach your destination. Start by narrowing down your choices; the rest will fall into place on its own."
gemini,2015-10-11,"Your friends encourage you to stretch beyond your limitations today, provoking uncharacteristic caution on your part. You know how far you can go and don't appreciate people who push you too far. Your impulse is to dig in your heels now; however, you don't want to miss out on such an exciting opportunity just to prove a point. Listen carefully to what's being offered and make your choice based on your own intuition and not anyone else's. Trusting yourself is key to your success."
cancer,2015-10-11,"An unexpected tug-of-war between social and personal responsibilities may tax your ability to remain flexible. You can see amazing possibilities popping up like flowers in a garden, even if they aren't quite what you anticipated. But mustering up enthusiasm is difficult when you have so many obligations in the present moment that you barely have time to think about tomorrow. Be patient and avoid making a final decision until the conflict settles down. There's no reason to panic; the urgency you feel is strictly your own."
leo,2015-10-11,"You may shock your friends with risky behavior today that could seem a bit extreme from anyone else's perspective. But people might not realize that your current restlessness did not just appear overnight. You have been contemplating a drastic move to stir the energy up for quite a while. Fortunately, this is your chance to sparkle and shine with or without an appreciative audience; after all, you are the captain of your ship and the master of your destiny."
virgo,2015-10-11,"Sometimes you are so exacting in your thinking that you convince yourself all other perspectives are less valid than yours. Thankfully, you have a cosmic chance to break out of a rut now and experiment with a whole new approach. You may discover your values are changing and it's time to let go of outmoded beliefs that do nothing but hold you back. However, logic will only carry you so far; you need to follow your intuition if you want to manifest a positive transformation."
libra,2015-10-11,"Accepting the limitations placed on you by your partner or a loved one can prove to be a real challenge today. Luckily, something special happens that opens the door of possibilities to what you once wanted but have since let go. Naturally, this surprise can be exciting, confusing and upsetting -- all at the very same time. Take a few deep breaths while you consider your choices today. Don't rush the decisions of your heart; time is on your side."
scorpio,2015-10-11,"You're walking on eggshells at home now because too many things are left unsaid. Meanwhile, you have a long list of chores to finish, but haven't yet determined the smartest way to navigate through the messy dynamics. Nevertheless, you may feel as if you're being forced to make a decision before you're ready. The time for ambivalence is over. Whatever you choose will ultimately be more advantageous than continuing to sit on the fence. Trust your instincts and take a leap of faith."
sagittarius,2015-10-11,"You have recently spent more than your fair share of time examining all the possibilities and analyzing every angle of your life. Although your grand scheme may remain unchanged, your plan to create your ideal future continues to undergo radical transformation. It's difficult to discern know whether or not these wonderful opportunities are real, which, in turn, makes it nearly impossible to fix on any one strategy now. The truth is waiting to be discovered if you're willing to search for it."
capricorn,2015-10-11,"You may have very specific tasks on your plate but they don't seem as significant now as your creative aspirations. Fortunately, you clearly understand the difference between your current responsibilities and your colorful dreams. Nevertheless, it's your less productive side that feeds your soul, and without inspiration your life begins to lose meaning. Don't favor your professional ambitions over your artistic leanings today; the ultimate key to your happiness is found in balancing both worlds."
aquarius,2015-10-11,"You don't have a clue how your life got so hectic, but if things are running amok today, you're driven to do something about it. However, impulsive radical action isn't the answer now, since there are potential consequences that could make your daily routine even crazier. There's nothing wrong with wanting results right away, but success is more likely if you implement change in small and manageable increments. A true genius knows when to sit still and when to rock the boat."
pisces,2015-10-11,"You may be annoyed by a surprising money matter today that can't be resolved quickly because you don't have all the information at your fingertips. Finding resolution might be as easy as locating a misplaced bill, calling the bank or balancing your checkbook. But it's a risky idea to cut corners and take action until you know all of the facts. Someone else could supply you with everything you need now, so don't be afraid to ask for assistance. There's no point in standing on ceremony when others are happy to help."
aries,2015-10-12,"You are ready to let go of your personal agenda now that the even-tempered Libra New Moon falls in your 7th House of Partnerships. Paradoxically, the likelihood of receiving support for your impetuous behavior increases when you distance yourself from others. Nevertheless, you could end up frustrated if you believe that you can happily exist in your dreamworld alone. Thankfully, finding ways to express yourself without going to extremes brings emotional satisfaction, but it just might arrive in a different package than you expected."
taurus,2015-10-12,"A coworker may present you with a complicated conundrum that eludes immediate resolution. Thankfully, the fair-minded Libra New Moon pacifies your 6th House of Employment, enabling you to emotionally detach yourself from the unresolved situation. You might not be able to fix the problem today, but you can't set it aside, either. Ultimately, you can be of the most help by just listening to your friends without interruption. Showing compassion by offering a  supportive shoulder is more useful now than rattling off an overly simplistic answer."
gemini,2015-10-12,"Wrestling with your own feelings isn't always the simplest thing to do; it's even more challenging when you're dealing with someone else's erratic emotions. Luckily, you can smoothly skate over this bumpy territory because the Libra New Moon's presence in your 5th House of Fun and Games allows you to maintain a playful attitude. But stress won't drop out of sight just because it's inconvenient for you; knowing what you can and can't control is your secret to happiness."
cancer,2015-10-12,"Taking a sentimental journey through your personal history isn't new behavior for you nostalgic Crabs, but the reflective Libra New Moon's emphasis on your 4th House of Roots raises issues that you might not have considered yet. Thankfully, you are in a positive frame of mind today, making it easier to handle the emotional complexities that arise now. But don't get lost on your trip down Memory Lane. It's more productive to remain in the present moment, instead of traveling back in time to relive your past."
leo,2015-10-12,"Although you believe you know what's best for you, today's accommodating Libra New Moon falls in your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to also consider the needs of others. But don't allow your current enthusiasm to trick you into thinking everything will turn out fine just because you're feeling generous. Although you might not normally be so dependent on anyone else, you can't fill in your schedule now before talking to the people who have a stake in your success. Practicing the art of compromise allows everyone to win in the end."
virgo,2015-10-12,"You must make a significant decision about your finances now, yet it's challenging to reach a definitive conclusion while the ambivalent Libra New Moon influences your 2nd House of Money. You may waste time wavering back and forth today, unable to finalize your choice. However, it's not helpful to be too self-critical. Wait a couple of days to see where the new wave of energy carries you before committing one way or the other. Keeping your options open improves your chances for success."
libra,2015-10-12,"You're eager to put your new intentions into constructive action, but first you need to express your desires clearly enough to create the impact you want. Thankfully, the strategic Libra New Moon triggers a sudden break from your recent past mistakes. Although focusing your thoughts on a specific goal can set you into motion, your irrepressible confidence isn't enough to assure that you'll reach your destination. Success is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration."
scorpio,2015-10-12,"You're often a champion at keeping secrets, but something you are hiding could spell trouble now. Although the friendly Libra New Moon creeps into your 12th House of Privacy, you yearn to tell someone what you know. However, you won't likely spill the beans if it means going back on your word. This dilemma is stressful if you believe there's no right course of action. Put off your final choice until the Moon enters insightful Scorpio tomorrow and then let your intuition be your guide."
sagittarius,2015-10-12,"Even if your social calendar is chaotic, the energy shifts when the artistic Libra New Moon rattles your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. You're marching to the beat of a different drummer now as you begin to pull away from the crowd. Although stress is exacerbated by awkward relationship dynamics, you still can continue to be true to yourself. Your interpersonal dance grows more fulfilling as you take care of your own needs first. Ultimately, living life in a creative manner improves your connections with everyone else."
capricorn,2015-10-12,"You're taking your professional obligations to heart while the diplomatic Libra New Moon is busy activating your 10th House of Social Status. Your career objectives are accentuated, but it isn't wise to pile more busy work onto your full plate today. Accept additional tasks only after you weigh and balance the pros and cons of having to fulfill another promise. Delegating specific jobs enables you to cover more ground without exhausting your resources. Think outside of the box and success is yours."
aquarius,2015-10-12,"Your excitement grows as you anticipate new ways to widen your world view as the creative Libra New Moon lands in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You're inspired to make a decision now about a new course of study to expand your horizons. But don't limit yourself to work-related subjects because it is time to break out of your rut by exploring a totally different universe. Free your mind, buckle your seat belt and enjoy the ride."
pisces,2015-10-12,"Your sensitivity to someone's emotions is the key that opens a door to intimacy while the lovely Libra New Moon strengthens your 8th House of Deep Sharing. However, there is no need for worry because your intuitive compass will prevent you from getting lost in uncharted waters. Fortunately, you can maintain clear boundaries today, even while diving into the unexplored shadows of an evolving relationship. Solving the mystery of love is a lifelong journey, so don't forget to come up for air now and then."
aries,2015-10-13,"You aren't willing to give up your freedom, even in a trade for a less stressful path in life. However, you might choose being responsible today over being independent -- although you may not be happy with your decision. Unfortunately, clinging to your annoyance can create serious problems. Expressing your negativity and then letting it go enables you to avoid feeling resentment later on. Living an ordinary life in an extraordinary manner inspires you to reach spiritual satisfaction."
taurus,2015-10-13,"Recent promises have you climbing the walls today, leaving you with little time to enjoy life's pleasures. Although your goals are straightforward, nothing is simple while everyone is making demands on your time. Unexpressed emotions can turn a casual encounter into a tangle of intrigue. Don't wait to address the source of a problem if you already understand the current dynamics. The sooner you start untying the knots, the faster it will go."
gemini,2015-10-13,"Your passions are running the show today, making you feel less confident of your decisions. But the intensity of relationship dynamics grows stronger as your emotions sink into the shadows of your subconscious. There isn't a lot of room for faulty logic now, so think through your plan before you initiate a process that can't be stopped midstream. Taking the time to consider what your heart needs empowers you to make the right choice."
cancer,2015-10-13,"You strive to see both sides of a relationship issue today, but are forced to take a position later on. The Moon's afternoon shift into emotional Scorpio reminds you that your feelings control so much of your behavior, you may not be able to change the outcome of the present situation. Listen to your inner voice now, but also be certain that your plan makes practical sense before doing something you soon regret. Using both your head and your heart allows you to see the full picture."
leo,2015-10-13,"There is still a lot of hard work to do over the next few weeks and you're thankful that all the noise is beginning to settle down. But instead of trying to tie up loose ends, you're more likely inclined to take the day off for rest and relaxation now. Balancing your hectic schedule with a bit of peaceful solitude at home today may be the smartest use of your time. Stepping away from the fray can be enough to revitalize your sense of purpose."
virgo,2015-10-13,"You're able to assimilate big changes into your life without too much difficulty now. However, you're not interested in simply trading a relaxing day for one filled with distractions. Happily, making a commitment to express yourself creatively motivates you to realize your greatest potential. Share whatever thoughts come to mind, even if it complicates the picture today. It really doesn't matter what artistic medium you choose, just let your imagination be your guide."
libra,2015-10-13,"You can't find enough time to kick back today, but you might believe you will get away without fulfilling all of your responsibilities. However, there is a difference between pursuing ambitious goals and simply honoring your promises. You may have to make up for lost time later in the evening if your laziness gets the best of you early on. Balancing work with play is a safer strategy than going to either extreme. Shuffling your priorities allows you to manage your calendar with finesse."
scorpio,2015-10-13,"You reach a significant fork in the road today, yet your current map isn't clear about where either path leads. Unfortunately, your decision-making process is a lot more complicated now because of this ambiguity. Nevertheless, the Moon's shift into your sign later in the day triggers your final answer, emboldening you to paint your future exactly as you visualize it in your imagination. Follow your heart and you can't go wrong."
sagittarius,2015-10-13,"It's a whole new ballgame once you decide that you're ready to step up to the plate and get to work. Surprisingly, you may procrastinate for a while, yet the momentum shifts so quickly today that you need to make pragmatic choices or you'll drift off course. Ironically, your dreams reveal the most sensible strategy at this time. Integrating your most creative visions with your current reality is your best recipe for a winning season."
capricorn,2015-10-13,"Your social life continues to be on the move as the emotional Moon enters your 11th House of Community. Although your friends may be overwhelmed with your relentless intensity, you just want to do the right thing. You're not interested in making mistakes that will send the wrong message. However, giving yourself permission to have fun is more important than anything else now. Nevertheless, you can deepen the connections in a significant relationship if you don't try so hard."
aquarius,2015-10-13,"You may enjoy the thrill of imagining whatever is around the next bend, but other people's demands can squelch the excitement today. The Moon's afternoon shift into your 10th House of Public Responsibility reminds you that you're not as independent as you wish. Establishing new priorities helps you navigate your way through tricky territory. But choose your path carefully because your current choices will likely have a lasting impact."
pisces,2015-10-13,"You aren't interested in casual conversations today because you feel as if you're running out of time to connect on an emotional level. You have no patience for social games that distract you from the real issues on your mind. However, it's not always easy to find the right person to bring into your confidence. Listen closely to your intuition and allow the universe to pick your audience. Sharing a story about your personal journey can inspire others to choose love over fear. Spreading light is what you Fish do best."
aries,2015-10-14,"You might be convinced that someone is manipulating reality now, trying to involve you in the very same emotional drama that you're doing your best to avoid. But your feelings are already aroused and it's more challenging to shut them off after they have been stirred. You may not be able to prevent an interaction from turning stormy today, but everyone will feel better once the whole story is out in the open. Applying equal measures of honesty and kindness cultivates peace and harmony."
taurus,2015-10-14,"You want to get back to basics now, yet others may be urging you to consider alternatives which will substantially complicate your life. Paradoxically, your resistance won't likely bring the simplicity you desire and might even trigger more unresolved emotions. This is not the time to stubbornly adhere to your principles. Demonstrating your flexibility could help everyone get through an awkward emotional impasse. Don't be afraid to let your wicked sense of humor save the day."
gemini,2015-10-14,"You are clinging to a set agenda today and aren't interested in anything that distracts you from making tangible progress toward your goal. Someone may misinterpret your single-mindedness as a personal rejection, but you just don't have time to engage in petty personal politics now. Keep your focus on your mission; you can let others know that you are ready for some fun and relaxation after you accomplish your work for the day. Making your priorities clear from the start makes life easier for everyone involved."
cancer,2015-10-14,"You're quietly preoccupied with making an important decision, leaving others to wonder why you're being so serious now. It's likely that your friends and family will want to help you narrow down your choices, but you might see this gentle interference as a way for them to exert control over your life. There's no reason to exclude someone who can be a trustworthy ally; let everyone know your concerns and be transparent about your boundaries. You may be in for a pleasant surprise if you assume the best of people instead of the worst."
leo,2015-10-14,"You are secretly sorting out your mixed feelings about an old friend or family member now, and you might not be ready to share your thoughts yet. You are weary of always being the person that others rely on, but it's the wrong time to let anyone down. Keeping your emotions out of the picture is probably a good idea today, as long as you don't do it in a halfway fashion. Process your negativity swiftly because any lingering resentment will get in the way of the generous support you have to offer. Maintaining objectivity is the secret to your current success."
virgo,2015-10-14,"You wake up believing that you can accomplish nearly anything today. Although you might fall short of your expectations, it's useless to waste energy on self-judgment when your intentions are  so honorable. Squeeze a bit of well-deserved playtime into your schedule now, no matter how many chores are on your to-do list. Ultimately, you'll be more productive if you make room in your day for creative pursuits. Freeing your imagination gives you a magical outlook on life."
libra,2015-10-14,"You might take an unpopular stance because you think remaining true to your core beliefs is more important than simply being nice today. But it can be challenging to hold your position, especially if your coworkers are trying to convince you that your ideas are wrong. The truth is, it's not about what anyone else wants; what counts the most is maintaining your integrity, even if it temporarily alienates you from others. To thine own self be true."
scorpio,2015-10-14,"Your friends may pretend that a difficult issue has been swept under the rug because they don't want to risk rocking the boat and making you mad. However, you instinctively know when people are keeping secrets from you, and you do not like being played one bit. Unfortunately, there's enough emotional fuzziness in the atmosphere to misinterpret someone's motives now, so lighten up and give everyone the benefit of the doubt. Treating others with the respect you would like in return is a good place to start."
sagittarius,2015-10-14,"You think it's simply a matter of being polite to remain quiet if you don't have something positive to say today. However, your current silence communicates more meaning than you realize now since others can't help but notice that you're not your usual sunny self. The good news is that it's unnecessary to control the flow of a conversation so you feel emotionally more secure. As long as you don't have cruel intentions, telling the truth as you see it is the kindest thing you can do for everyone involved."
capricorn,2015-10-14,"People put you on a pedestal, especially on a day like today when you can set a fine example by stepping into a leadership role. Nevertheless, it isn't wise to complicate a situation by telling anyone else what to do; instead, get to work without assuming your way is the only path to productivity. Your most effective strategy is simply to show up with a positive attitude. In the final analysis, it's more authentic to engage others with your uncertainty now than to act like you have all of the answers."
aquarius,2015-10-14,"Everyone is demanding a lot from you now, and you might think that they are being unreasonable. Fortunately, you're not responsible to live up to anyone's expectations except your own. Don't promise more than you can deliver; set sensible goals early in the day and make your intentions known to others. Just remember to keep your doubts to yourself today or you could just feed into the negativity lingering in the air. Doing your best is all that is required to prove your sincerity."
pisces,2015-10-14,"It's surprising how quickly you're able to shift from overly ambitious goals to very pragmatic ones today. Some of your most vivid dreams are already fading, leaving you with a realistic picture of what you can actually accomplish. However, don't waste your precious time trying to conform to someone else's grand plan now. Trust your own vision; it's really the only one that matters in the end."
aries,2015-10-15,"Achieving your career objectives or finding your life's purpose grows more crucial now as your ambitions intensify. You may even turn obsessive, fearful that you might miss your chance if you don't drive yourself as relentlessly as possible today. Unfortunately, it's possible to ride roughshod over people if you are only focused on your own goals. Thankfully, practicing a touch of diplomacy enables you to be more effective than you ever thought possible. Your heart connections enrich your life in ways your work never can."
taurus,2015-10-15,"A relationship grows more complex if your friend or partner is as inflexible as you are today. Fortunately, you can transform the tense dynamics by resolving to meet others halfway, instead of demanding that they adapt to your agenda. In fact, you might be so pleased with the results of your collaboration that you give more in return. Instead of trying to prove your superiority now, it's more useful to seek common ground instead. Mutual admiration is the key to creating an unbreakable bond."
gemini,2015-10-15,"It's rather unnerving when your rational thoughts are overpowered by irrational emotions. It might even appear as if you're losing control of your feelings today. However, this can be quite the magical moment if you're willing to admit to yourself that you weren't running the show even when you believed you were. Widen your horizons by exploring the darker corners of your heart and tune into a deeper message that's buried underneath the noisy distraction of language. Suspending your disbelief is the first step to embarking on a journey of the soul."
cancer,2015-10-15,"Existential concerns linger on  your mind now, but they won't prevent you from joining others in pursuit of a good time. You want to enjoy the camaraderie, but still have mixed feelings about engaging in lighthearted social chatter today. Unfortunately, you can take contemplation too far; obsessing too much on your emotions gets old quickly when you end up in the same dark place. Consciously setting your serious thoughts aside gives you the chance to create special memories with the ones you love the most."
leo,2015-10-15,"You think you need to work diligently these days so you can earn more money, but financial success will lose its importance in the weeks ahead. Luckily, you aren't in a hurry now because you secretly believe that your patience will ultimately be rewarded. But don't reveal all your cards at once or you'll give away your power too soon. Playing the waiting game is easier if everyone doesn't know what move you're going to make next. The element of surprise is your secret weapon."
virgo,2015-10-15,"You might feel as if you've been operating within a protective bubble lately, but tensions still lurk in the shadows. You may be clever enough today to avoid an open conflict with someone close to you, but there's still a world of difference that separates you from each other. Thankfully, you're motivated by a sense of mutual respect and the tolerance of different beliefs. Giving the gift of freedom to others enables love to flourish in a healthy environment."
libra,2015-10-15,"Perhaps you recently demonstrated your flexibility by encouraging the people you love to pursue their own interests. But now the tables are turned and you may need to defend your personal agenda. You're not so eager to accept someone else's vision if it contradicts your basic values or dashes your dreams. Overcome your fears and state your boundaries clearly. Although this confrontational strategy can feel frightening at first, everyone will understand your position once you stand up for your rights."
scorpio,2015-10-15,"Although your emotions float dangerously close to the surface while the Moon visits your sign, you have the presence of mind to keep sensitive issues to yourself. Instead of talking strategy today, you're ready to act on your feelings while courageous Mars harmonizes with passionate Pluto. Although your moods fluctuate throughout the day, your resolve remains steadfast and you won't be easily deterred from your destination. Fortunately, you can make great progress now as long as you don't try to cut any corners along the way."
sagittarius,2015-10-15,"A recent shake-up of the status quo might have seemed exhilarating in the moment, but now you realize it will only take you so far. Others may not fully approve of your need to create change because they only see what's working well. Meanwhile, your inner restlessness won't leave you alone until you do something about it. There's a time for bending in the wind, but today you must be the strong and fearless Centaur charging toward the horizon. Act with authority, even if you have to fake it at first."
capricorn,2015-10-15,"You have a welcome opportunity to retreat from your usual responsibilities today, giving you valuable time to reassess your overall direction in life. Normally, your legendary ambition drives you on an upward path toward your career aspirations, but you're less concerned with professional advancement now than with spiritual fulfillment. Thankfully, removing the pressure to succeed could open new doorways to destinations that were not previously on your map. Dance with the unknown and explore to your heart's content."
aquarius,2015-10-15,"You know exactly where you are going and what you are doing today, but you don't want to make a big fuss about it. Even if someone tries to tap into your wisdom and experience, you might avoid engaging in a lengthy conversation because you prefer journeying alone now. Don't worry about impressing anyone else with your competence; you have nothing to prove to the rest of the world. Just get on with your current business and let everyone else take care of theirs. Some days you are an open book, and some days you're not."
pisces,2015-10-15,"Regaining clarity about your long-term goals rejuvenates your spirit today. However, your intense feelings about a relationship might not be  so well received by someone else. Your message is very important now, but so is the tone of your words. Even if your perspective is a radical one, there's no need to purposefully provoke people's fears. Thankfully, striving for the highest potential keeps you on a spiritual path and inspires others to do the same."
aries,2015-10-16,"The more facts you have at your disposal today, the more you realize that you don't really know what someone else is feeling. Although you may be inclined to jump to premature conclusions now, the longer you can sit with your uncertainty, the better your chances for creating a meaningful connection. Instead of pushing for resolution on a relationship issue, surrender your need for control. The mysteries of love are enchanting when you're willing to open your heart and let Cupid play his part."
taurus,2015-10-16,"You are driven by a strong desire for perfection today, but satisfaction remains elusive. Romantic Venus opposes nebulous Neptune, tricking you into combining your dreams with reality. Nevertheless, you won't float off into the clouds while the Moon joins forces with pragmatic Saturn. Listening to your heart helps you turn a daydream into something real. Be willing to take a risk and let go of what you assume to be true; what you see now is not what you get, so trust your sixth sense over your sight."
gemini,2015-10-16,"You have big dreams about what you want to do today but your actual preferences are restrained by practical considerations. You might feel as if making a personal sacrifice will prevent you from manifesting your dreams. But instead of being disappointed if reality falls short of your expectations, look for undiscovered opportunities that accompany the unexpected changes. There are more options than you can imagine if you remain open to the abundance of the universe."
cancer,2015-10-16,"Your daydreams are so distracting today that you might easily overlook pertinent information required to make an informed decision. Successful strategies to combat your fuzzy thinking include asking questions and remembering to read every word before signing on the dotted line. If you're not careful, you could be swayed by someone's charming presentation now. You may be sorely disappointed if you just assume that everything will work out for the best. Gathering all the facts before making your move is your safest bet."
leo,2015-10-16,Your love life is a conundrum today because flirty Venus is playing with your heart while nebulous Neptune clouds your judgment. Someone may enchant you now as your imagination turns a frog into a prince or princess in your dreams. It's all rainbows and unicorns until you wake up and have to manage everything the way it is in reality rather than how you envisioned it in your fantasies. Follow your heart but don't get lost along the way.
virgo,2015-10-16,"You might be in for a rather frustrating day if you believe that you must maintain tight control in a relationship. But once you have your first confrontation with a friend or partner, your illusions will dissipate quickly like clouds after a storm. Asking someone else to lead for a while lessens the pressure and allows you to enjoy yourself without having to micromanage every detail. Accepting that others have just as much to bring to the table as you makes all the difference in the world."
libra,2015-10-16,"You prefer seeking the elusive perfection of beauty than dealing with mundane reality. Although fulfilling your responsibilities can be challenging today, you can't leave your chores undone for another day. Your ruling planet Venus brings you a lovely image to play with now, but it's slightly out of focus as she duels with mystical Neptune. Thankfully, once your work is finished you can drift off into dreamland without any interruptions or guilt."
scorpio,2015-10-16,"A solution to a stressful dilemma may not be forthcoming today, but part of the problem is that you won't receive useful answers until you can formulate clear questions. Take some quiet time away from your current obligations to untangle your thoughts. Once you've established a logical starting point, the rest of the process will be much easier. Patience is a virtue, especially when it comes to matters of the heart."
sagittarius,2015-10-16,"Even if you're dealing with the same confusing issues as yesterday, they might not appear to bother you as much today. However, just beneath your life-is-wonderful veneer, stresses are still at work. Don't waste precious energy trying to make your life look better than it actually is. Once others see that you have problems just like them, they'll be more inclined to interact with you on a personal level. Expressing the truth reveals your vulnerability and paves a path for  authentic relationships."
capricorn,2015-10-16,"You might not know where to begin today if someone questions your integrity. Defending your position is challenging when the validity of your assumptions is uncertain and you don't have any specific evidence to back them up. Unfortunately, the more you argue your point, the greater the gulf grows between you and others. Forget about talking your way through this predicament now; let your actions speak for themselves."
aquarius,2015-10-16,"Just when you thought everything was perfect, a close friend brings a missing fact to your attention today, reminding you that you are not seeing things in a clear light. Although you might slip into a downward spiral if you temporarily lose your center, you can pull yourself out of a nose dive as quickly as it began with a little positive self-affirmation. Readjust your thinking and widen your perspective to integrate the new information into your overall strategy. There's no reason to contract out of fear; spread your wings and fly."
pisces,2015-10-16,"Keeping your impulses in check is nearly impossible today, especially if someone is tempting you to climb out on a limb and express your feelings. But your partner or a friend could lay down some rules now that won't easily let you off the hook. Instead of striking out because you're afraid of rejection, face your fears before you experience a relationship crisis. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
aries,2015-10-17,"Cleaning house (literally or figuratively) makes perfect sense today while energetic Mars joins visionary Jupiter in your 6th House of Details. You have a crystal clear idea of what you want to accomplish and possess the stamina to get things done now. However, you must take a big job and break it down into smaller manageable pieces in order to be efficient. Don't bite off more than you can chew or you'll be tired at the end of the day with little to show for your exemplary efforts. Making a sustainable plan sets you up for success."
taurus,2015-10-17,"A new idea captures your imagination today, but you won't necessarily put enough effort into making your vision come true. It's not that you're avoiding hard work now; it's just your common sense could overrule your initial excitement. Remember, your plan deserves enough time to simmer and marinate before you prematurely rush into action or discard it entirely. If your strategy is as brilliant as you think it is, it's worth investing your resources to see where it leads. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
gemini,2015-10-17,"Although you usually thrive on being in the center of the action, you may actually reach an exhaustion point from all the social buzz today. Knowing when you have had enough is a sign of maturity, but setting limits can be a serious challenge. Acknowledge your fear of missing out on something special, but call it quits before your head starts to hurt. Rest and relaxation is the necessary prescription for the day; if you carefully follow the doctor's orders, tomorrow you will wake up with a fresh outlook on life."
cancer,2015-10-17,"Your current optimism could inspire you to make ambitious plans to accomplish your career goals. However, your unbridled enthusiasm immediately impacts your social activities today as your professional confidence spills over into your personal life. Fortunately, if you have earned the respect of those you love, they will be eager to follow your lead. Don't waste time asking questions now; it's your turn to take charge and show everyone you're the boss."
leo,2015-10-17,"You can burn off excess energy easily today by doing something physical such as sweating at the gym or hiking a nearby trail. But it' also essential to stretch the muscles of your mind now by learning something new. Your mental appetite may be satisfied by passionately discussing an unique course of study with a friend, or perhaps doing research of your own involving topics of religion, metaphysics or politics. Whatever you choose to do now, going the distance will be far more rewarding than staying on familiar ground."
virgo,2015-10-17,"Your exuberance might lead you into the danger zone if you don't find a way to contain your confidence today. The combustible power of the Mars-Jupiter conjunction in your sign may be enough to blast you into orbit, but you could deplete your energy reserves too fast, leaving you to crash back to Earth with a painful thud. Remember, too much of a good thing isn't always good. Anything you can do to soothe your soul or settle your nerves will help you to make the most of this memorable time."
libra,2015-10-17,"Your obsessive interest in getting to the bottom of a mystery might be a bit too intense for everyone else today. You want answers and you are prepared to ask whatever questions are necessary to find the missing pieces of the puzzle. However, your insatiable curiosity could seem confrontational now, even if that's not your intention. Be as transparent as possible so your actions are not misunderstood. You'll make more progress in your search for the truth if you don't push so hard."
scorpio,2015-10-17,"Your friends may be so outrageously optimistic that you think they have gone slightly mad. At first it's fun being around exuberant people who are on a mission to do something out of the ordinary today. Unfortunately, you suddenly realize that you might be the only one who is willing to issue a reality check. However, don't try to change their plans by raining on their parade. All you have to do is be clear about the limits of your participation. Paradoxically, you can be a positive role model now by being brave enough to say no. A true leader knows when enough is enough."
sagittarius,2015-10-17,"Fun-filled activities can put a happy smile on your face now if you simply remember to moderate your natural inclination for bigger, better and more. You could get into trouble by taking a good idea and turning it into such a huge deal today that it eventually fizzles. Although you might believe you're being quite rational as you map out the future, your perspective is skewed by the conjunction of red-hot Mars and giant Jupiter. You can't do everything you imagine, but as long as your heart is in the right place, you can accomplish Herculean feats."
capricorn,2015-10-17,"As much as you may love spending the day at home with your family, too much domestic bliss might have you dreaming about ways to escape today. It's not that you long to be somewhere else; it's just that you don't like giving up an entire day without having something tangible to show for it. Try motivating others to participate in some sort of home improvement project. If they seem more interested in goofing around now, join in the frivolity for a bit and then excuse yourself so you can create something beautiful on your own."
aquarius,2015-10-17,"You are buzzing around like a busy bee today, flitting from one flower to the next in a field filled with beautiful distractions. In fact, there are so many exciting possibilities to explore, you might feel a bit lost because you don't know where to start or what to do next. However, there's no reason to hold back for appearance's sake; just dive in and indulge like a kid in a candy store with no one watching. Act now, analyze later."
pisces,2015-10-17,"Relationships are going your way now, as long as you don't try to put your partner into a box. The expansive Mars-Jupiter conjunction widens your 7th House of Others, surprising you with the amount of love and support you could receive if you're accepting of its many various shapes and colors. However, you might inadvertently cut yourself off from the emotional goodies if your expectations are too specific today. A grateful heart is a powerful heart."
aries,2015-10-18,"Relationships hold great potential now, but only if you remember that you're seeing everything through a subjective filter. Distinguishing your dreams from the actual events in your life may be more complicated than you realize today. You don't have the whole picture yet, so don't make any promises you will regret later. Ask questions and listen closely to the answers, but don't miss the unspoken messages in between the words. Making a commitment is wise only after you have a solid grip on the current dynamics."
taurus,2015-10-18,"You start out the day with so many choices that you could feel slightly lost. In fact, sorting out all the possibilities may be so overwhelming that you throw your hands up in the air and walk away in frustration. You might even set aside the facts in favor of pursuing your desires today. Ironically, this ill-conceived strategy can actually work for you now as long as you remember that you still must contend with reality sooner or later. In the meantime, following the vagaries of your imagination could prove to be an amazing journey on its own."
gemini,2015-10-18,"Although you're able to put your faith in a friend or partner today, it takes more than one person's optimism to get you through the day. An emotional drama can become quite convoluted, especially if someone's feelings contradict yours. The good news is you don't have to agree on every issue; instead of focusing on the differences, concentrate on the similarities. All it takes to successfully sidestep an unnecessary conflict is to share a common dream and give others the benefit of the doubt."
cancer,2015-10-18,"Even if you are feeling under the weather today, you can still rely on your performance skills to successfully execute your agenda. Imagine reaching your goal and then discuss your vision with others as realistically as possible. Painting the details of your plan in your mind's eye helps you get started but you must take the next step and verbalize your ambitious ideas to launch your dream. Intention plus hard work equals magic."
leo,2015-10-18,"You might be pleasantly distracted by a flirtatious encounter today. However, confusion stems from your inability to untangle your desires from the reality of the interaction. It's nearly impossible now to tell where the hard edges of truth crumble into the creative fabrications of your imagination. There's no harm in a little romance as long as no one's feelings get hurt, including yours. Wait for clarification from someone you trust before you hand over your heart to the wrong person."
virgo,2015-10-18,"Let go of the smallest details today because they will not matter much in the long run. Try to loosen your grip on your daily routine; going along with the flow can have an immediate beneficial effect on your self-esteem. An authoritative approach naturally invites backlash. However, a hands-off style prompts your friends to be more encouraging of your goals, which increases your optimism. You can enrich your experiences now by allowing the energy to unfold without micromanaging each and every moment."
libra,2015-10-18,"Your artistic creativity may be soaring to great heights now, but you must consciously stretch to reach for your vision with all your heart. However, even if you're not aesthetically inclined, you can still use your charm to get what you want today. Tread carefully and pay attention to the feedback you receive from those who have your best interests at heart. Don't assume that others share your dream until they tell you their true feelings. Figuring out your next move will be a piece of cake once you know where everyone else stands."
scorpio,2015-10-18,"You are standing at the threshold of a dream now, but you can't tell where it will ultimately carry you. Subconscious streams of messages are flowing into awareness and you might wish to act quickly on what you envision. But this isn't the time to just ride the currents of your imagination. Practice controlling your mind so you can take your creativity to the next level. Keep your thoughts on track and turn today's fantasies into tomorrow's reality."
sagittarius,2015-10-18,"You may be confused about what's true today. Your smartest strategy is to suspend judgment now if you cannot tell what is real. Just accept your perceptions as you would if they were scenes in a movie, without feeling any emotional attachment. The bad news is hasty decisions you make might have to be reconsidered in just a few days. Wait until reality sets you gently back on the ground before choosing your new direction. In the meantime, color your world any way you want."
capricorn,2015-10-18,"Your contributions around the home are acknowledged by those close to you today, even if you aren't working very hard. Ironically, being appreciated for your extra efforts presents a problem if you don't think you deserve the recognition. Meanwhile, your current positive attitude tempts you to overextend your reach, especially if everything is looking rosy. Remember, it's more important to conserve what you have now rather than dreaming about your achievements in the future. Counting your blessings is always a good place to start."
aquarius,2015-10-18,"Your mind is roaming to the distant edges of your imagination today, dreaming of exotic lands and traveling to other galaxies. Luckily, there's no reason to deny your desires since you are hearing the call of a great adventure -- and this is a perfect time to respond. Extrapolate on your most fantastic thoughts and use them to write the next chapter in your life. Mystical Poet William Blake wrote, ""What is now proved was once only imagined."""
pisces,2015-10-18,"You may be feeling pressured to let go of an impossible dream today, but it's tempting to hold on to your sweet fantasy no matter what anyone else says. Nevertheless, you might suddenly waver and conclude that a more practical approach will serve you better. However, anything is possible now, and your visions could actually begin to materialize if you accept them as real. Don't sell yourself short; even if you run into resistance, imagination rules. Master Michelangelo extolled, ""Faith in oneself is the best and safest course."""
aries,2015-10-19,"You have a lot of chores to finish today and your responsible attitude carries over past normal business hours. Your current priority is to demonstrate your efficiency to others, so list all your tasks and stay focused until you make a serious dent in your work. Channel your stress into action by striving to tie up any loose ends now. Don't delay because your reservoir of energy could dissipate later in the week. Your willingness to put in overtime shows your commitment to getting the job done."
taurus,2015-10-19,"You might sense a growing resistance from a close friend today, but you're not in the mood for conflict and confrontation. Nevertheless, people seem emotionally distant now as roadblocks appear to delay your satisfaction. Thankfully, there's no point in getting your knickers in a twist because the tension will settle on its own. Instead, concentrate on the love that is already in your life; celebrating the glass being half-full is a much healthier strategy than complaining that it's half-empty."
gemini,2015-10-19,"Your greatest worry is that you can't pursue every curiosity that catches your eye today. However, your time and energy are limited by circumstances beyond your control. This temporary situation prevents you from being as footloose and fancy-free as you prefer. However, significant changes are occurring in your private inner world despite your current frustration. Don't stand in your own way of progress even if you're not clear where your choices will lead. Trusting the universe is the fastest way to find the silver linings in the clouds above your head."
cancer,2015-10-19,"Your emotional neediness could block your access to satisfaction, since it's not likely that others will meet your expectations now. But this imbalance isn't as bad as it might sound once you realize the real lesson is about learning what you can do for yourself. If you're already in a close partnership, you may need to back off a bit to allow everyone involved more breathing room. Fortunately, this exercise in self-sufficiency can help you clearly define what you want from a relationship if you're willing to let go and follow your heart."
leo,2015-10-19,"It seems as if your life is finally settling down to a comfortable pace, but this optimistic assessment may be slightly premature. Even if you can see positive change at work today, there are unexpected twists and turns on your chosen path. Be smart and prepare for whatever you might find once you get around the next bend in the road. Your ability to analyze the facts and decide what is most critical now will help you navigate this transformative phase with flying colors."
virgo,2015-10-19,"Some people believe that the highest form of creativity originates only from the wellsprings of inspiration. However, the source of your current creative streak may be triggered by your pressing desire to finish a project now. Happily, you possess the ability to transform your professional ambitions and romantic urges into practical manifestations. Be certain that whatever endeavor you undertake today is done with a greater purpose in mind; your word is your wand."
libra,2015-10-19,"Unresolved family issues work their way to the surface today, even if you attempt to remain as cool as a cucumber. But an unexpected disruption to your routine might not be the worst thing if it puts you in touch with buried emotions. Resisting the natural flow of your feelings is unnecessary now, even if it creates temporary discomfort or interrupts your productivity. Increasing your awareness facilitates positive change that may already be overdue. Metamorphosis happens if you're willing to explore your heart."
scorpio,2015-10-19,"Two very different issues may require your attention now. On one hand, you're redefining your boundaries, and this emotional process might intensify your isolation for a while. But on the other hand, a parade of amazing revelations prevents you from sinking into self-pity. You're too amused by the soap opera that is your life to take things seriously today. Examine your world with an objective eye while you have the chance; cultivating emotional detachment encourages personal growth."
sagittarius,2015-10-19,"Although your optimism is a powerful motivational tool at times, your confidence can get in the way of your success today. If your healthy self-esteem is presently faltering, make a pact with yourself to intentionally travel to the depths of your subconscious. Decide what's most valuable and then return to the surface refreshed and ready to work for what you want. A treasure from the underworld contains magic and can be catalytic on your journey of self-transformation."
capricorn,2015-10-19,"Your first inclination when waves of intense feelings begin to wash over you today is to reinforce your tide walls to halt the flow of emotions. You may be afraid that your powerful moods could destabilize your personal world in ways that aren't easy to manage. However, the more you constrain your irrational side now, the greater the probability of unwanted changes. Relax your resistance and trust your intuition to teach you how to navigate the murky waters of your heart."
aquarius,2015-10-19,"Someone may be trying to manipulate your behavior today, yet you don't have enough information at your disposal to fight off the apparent threat. There are still hidden pieces to the puzzle and it's difficult to defend against an unseen enemy. Rather than shadow boxing, it's more productive to maintain familiar routines for a while longer. The truth becomes clear soon enough, and there will still be time to act when it does. Patience is your best friend now; proceed slowly and with great intent."
pisces,2015-10-19,"Although you're unable to express yourself freely  today, ironically, this emotional restraint works in your favor. Fortunately, your social connections stabilize your reactions as your peers help you keep your cool in the midst of a storm. You realize that you could inadvertently offend the people who mean the most to you by sharing whatever crosses your mind now. Heed the words of Thumper, ""If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."" Exercising your right to remain silent is the key to your current interpersonal success."
aries,2015-10-20,"You may breathe a sigh of relief today because it seems like recent tensions are beginning to subside. Although there are positive signs that make you smile, you won't likely get the full resolution you seek. You're not in an optimal position to make significant progress but, at least, you're growing more confident about the future. There's nothing to be gained by being overly ambitious now; just hold your ground and wait for a clear signal before moving forward. Timing is everything."
taurus,2015-10-20,"You're happily surprised by how quickly things change today as you're catapulted out of your regular routine and shot into a new orbit. Although the quirky Aquarius Moon might not bring emotional comfort, it sounds a loud wake-up call to remind you of the radical ideas you set aside recently in your quest to fit in. Your fan base is solid now, so you really don't have anything to lose. Thinking outside of the box will be instrumental to your future success."
gemini,2015-10-20,"Oddly enough, your growing sense of freedom may relieve your need to rebel against the status quo. Although you don't feel as independent as you wish, at least some restrictions appear to be lifting now. But don't spoil your opportunity to be productive by frittering away your precious time. Stay as focused as you were when you were under pressure and you might just accomplish more than you ever thought possible. Demonstrating your willingness to work hard earns you extra brownie points."
cancer,2015-10-20,"The slow pace of change might not be speedy enough for you today. You are acutely aware of how far you have already traveled on your journey, but there's still a huge gulf between where you are now and where you want to be in the future. However, there's no point in dwelling on your limitations. Instead of constantly comparing your current progress to your beautiful dreams, just concentrate on the task right in front of your nose. Inch by inch it's a cinch; yard by yard, it's hard."
leo,2015-10-20,"Unexpressed feelings cultivate unrest in your life, but you can't seem to find the real source of the problem. Paradoxically, the closer you get to the truth, the more obscured the answer becomes today. Although it may be wise to dig deep on other occasions, this isn't one of them. Leave the sleeping mysteries alone while you redirect your attention to those things that are most obvious. For now, what you don't know can't hurt you. Save your impressive roar for another day."
virgo,2015-10-20,"So much has happened in your life over the past few months, yet you might not be able to see the ramifications of the changes yet. Although the transition continues to evolve slower than you wish, your life is undergoing a subtle-but-total transformation. Instead of ruminating over your past mistakes, focus on small tasks that you can start and finish in a day. Rather than working harder, work smarter. Consider yourself a diamond in the rough; don't let any criticism get in the way of your ultimate success."
libra,2015-10-20,"Instead of stressing over a recent lost opportunity, try a more radical solution to your woes, like letting go and trusting the universe. Ironically, taking a well-deserved break may carry you further toward success now than if you push relentlessly ahead. It's essential to revitalize your creativity and reestablish your center. Don't be concerned if you aren't very productive today; it could take several more days to generate the results you want. Good things come to those who wait."
scorpio,2015-10-20,"You might want to disconnect from your emotional roots today because you don't want anyone to perceive you as being overly needy. You can outwardly demonstrate an apparent aloofness so no one suspects that you're actually feeling quite vulnerable now. However, your reverse psychology could backfire by amplifying your sense of alienation and deepening your sorrow. You must take a risk if you want to break an old pattern based on mistrust and secrecy. Sharing your truth with someone you trust helps to heal your heart."
sagittarius,2015-10-20,"Unfinished projects continue to pile up at work, yet you could find time today to play a bit of catch-up. You might give yourself the luxury of relaxing later if you can stay on task during the day. But there is simply too much going on for you to check out completely. It may help to create a detailed list of everything you want to accomplish and then cross the items off one at a time. Believe it or not, the satisfaction you gain from a job well done is more gratifying now than any transient pleasures."
capricorn,2015-10-20,"A highly productive morning goes a long way to ease the current pressure in your life. But slacking off before you do your chores is not your modus operandi, especially when there are so many people counting on you. Get down to work instead of wasting time replaying your recent accomplishments or fretting about missed deadlines. Just tie up as many loose ends as possible to fully prepare for the busy week ahead. The more you finish now, the more reason you have to celebrate later."
aquarius,2015-10-20,"You could grow quite weary and discouraged today, if all of your hard work hasn't yet paid off. However, you may have already made more headway than you realize, since the moody Moon's shift into your sign might color your perceptions with doubt or deception. But don't shut down your awareness even if you want to escape from your feelings. Your negativity will fade if you put your emotions into a healthy perspective. Your sense of humor can be your saving grace if you are willing to laugh at yourself as much as others."
pisces,2015-10-20,"Although today may be a harbinger of exciting new beginnings, the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Endings also brings good fortune if you're willing to reflect on the past. But don't get too hooked by the mundane world or you could miss the intuitive inspiration that's bubbling up from your subconscious. There are unseen forces at work now and your subtle impressions can be instrumental for successfully guiding you through the major changes ahead."
aries,2015-10-21,"A recent event may have unexpectedly triggered emotions that influence what you expect from your friends. However, something is brewing today that isn't obvious, and in the typical style of the Ram you just charge headlong into the situation without even stopping to think. Luckily, a sudden change of plans could lead to a win-win outcome if you can place the greater good of the community ahead of your own personal needs. Your quickest path to success is found by making others happy now."
taurus,2015-10-21,"You might be entangled in a complicated situation at work and speaking the truth won't make your life any easier today. Even if you can rationalize your desires with the best of intentions, you may still feel more comfortable if you temporarily suppress your emotions and follow a more practical course of action now. Sometimes direct confrontation is effective; other times, it's best to let sleeping dogs lie. Fly beneath the radar as long as it's feasible; better safe than sorry."
gemini,2015-10-21,"Your dreams have a chance to become real today, so don't squander this surprising opportunity by fixating on unattainable goals. The Aquarius Moon's presence in your 9th House of Adventure may give you an irrepressible case of restlessness. Fortunately, you could effectively use this cosmic energy to plan a quick getaway or a fabulous trip to a distant place. Pack your bags and pick a destination because you might just find yourself on the road for business or pleasure before you know it."
cancer,2015-10-21,"You like the idea of being amongst your peers today, even if you actually prefer to be alone. Ironically, your paradoxical thinking could quickly grow annoying to everyone else. On one hand, you want to sink into your feelings and wallow around in the recesses of your imagination. But you also want to enjoy the camaraderie of your friends and benefit from their wisdom. Don't try to resolve this inner contradiction now. Your current detachment will reward you with the inner clarity that you seek. Save your social networking until you're in the mood."
leo,2015-10-21,"The conflict between your desire to get ahead professionally and your attachment to a personal relationship creates a minor dilemma today. You may find yourself in a tense situation where contradictory demands are being placed on you, but an emotional response might be inappropriate. Instead of making a scene, keep a tight lid on your feelings until you are alone. Maintaining a stable and steady outward appearance now cultivates peace and puts you on the path to resolution."
virgo,2015-10-21,"You're naturally quite adept at sorting through all the information and determining the most efficient route to get the job done. However, organizing your thoughts is more challenging now, especially since your perspective is distorted by your obsession with the details. At first, you believe you know the solution and act accordingly; but then you may wonder if you moved too soon. Don't declare your final answer just yet; instead, relax and allow the process to work out on its own."
libra,2015-10-21,"The energetic imbalance between your current experience and what you previously thought to be true is making you second guess everything you believed. However intense this stress feels today, rest assured that it's a temporary condition. Your head and your heart are at odds with each other now as you perceive a reality that's vastly different from your ideal scenario. Simply acknowledging that there are many ways to view your world multiplies your options. Open your mind; the path to your future will appear when you least expect it."
scorpio,2015-10-21,"Undeniable opportunities relentlessly lure you forward, but following your calling can cause undue stress on your personal life. Several planets place energetic emphasis on resourceful Venus and bountiful Jupiter as they wander through your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. However, maintaining domestic stability is just as important when it comes to your happiness. Don't run off to pursue altruistic ambitions until you know that your feet are on the ground and your priorities are in order. Reconnecting with those closest to you gives you the wind beneath your wings."
sagittarius,2015-10-21,"You are a straight shooter when sharing information, but your penchant for blunt honesty has unexpected consequences. You may have recently upset a coworker by expressing what was on your mind and now you have to clean up the mess that you inadvertently created. The problem is that you meant exactly what you said and you're irritated that you have to apologize today. Take the high road for the sake of the team and consider this as a lesson learned. Stating the truth is still the best policy but don't forget to be considerate of other people's feelings along the way."
capricorn,2015-10-21,"It's a good idea to slow down now to avoid a snag in your plans if you're working on a creative project. Luckily, you can see the potential trouble before it rears its ugly head and adopting a more deliberate approach gives you additional time to solve the problem in advance. But don't give up on your vision when your clarity is so sharp; just regroup and acclimate to the new dynamics before pushing forward. Keeping your current inspiration alive is the key to your soul's satisfaction."
aquarius,2015-10-21,"Although your ingenuity is in full bloom now, you can become overly fixated on executing your plan exactly as you see it in your mind's eye. Unfortunately, you may be tempted to dig in your heels today, even when the current circumstances are begging for an entirely new strategy. Ironically, greater flexibility in your thinking ultimately strengthens your position rather than weakening it. Being willing to modify your agenda doesn't necessarily mean changing your goals. Let your cool logic save you from yourself."
pisces,2015-10-21,"It appears that you can effectively communicate your needs today, but there is a churning turmoil within your heart that no one knows anything about. You may experience conflicting desires now, and are clueless on how to express them diplomatically. Honestly, you could benefit from a bit of solitude so you have the time to quietly sit with your own thoughts. You can turn your ideas into the right words once you get in touch with your feelings. Journey within before reaching out."
aries,2015-10-22,"Nothing is to be gained by letting your anger distract you from what you need to say today. Even if your discomfort seems to be approaching a flash point, you don't have to automatically throw a burning match into the emotional tinder. The current situation is crazy enough without you adding to the volatility. Bite your tongue, take a few deep breaths and put on a happy face. Then, state your case as gently as possible. Remaining calm, cool and collected enables you to deliver your message with the greatest impact."
taurus,2015-10-22,You're tempted to take risks today that you might normally never consider. It's nearly impossible to contain your energy while steady Saturn is at odds with unstable Uranus. You're uncharacteristically restless and may even be on the prowl for mischief. Acknowledging the intensity of your desires now empowers you to handle them with grace and maturity; denying your feelings only causes them to grow stronger. Strive to be unconventional without turning your life upside down in the process.
gemini,2015-10-22,"You could be in for quite a wonderful surprise today as something totally unexpected grabs your attention. However, don't move too fast if you feel a knot in the bottom of your stomach. What you see is not the whole story and trusting your intuition can save you from yourself. Ultimately, it's not a good idea to take the bait unless you are ready to go on a ride to points unknown. Stop moving for a minute, block out the noise and re-establish your center. The answer will be crystal clear once you listen to your heart."
cancer,2015-10-22,"You're obsessed with your ambitions today and already have a serious plan in mind to reach your goals. However, expressing your needs up front may be out of character for you. Even if you tend to be shy, you currently have the potential to rattle everyone's cage by acting impulsively. Don't spend too much energy resisting if your emotions are carrying you into new territory. A wonderful experience might be just around the next bend if you have the courage to take a leap of faith and go there."
leo,2015-10-22,"Think twice before jumping into a new friendship or partnership today. Unfortunately, it may be tricky to see how deep the water actually is from your current vantage point on the shore. Even if you're an accomplished swimmer, the emotional currents can shift quickly now, making it challenging to predict which direction you're heading. Luckily, you could build a strong foundation for a relationship if you just remember to proceed with caution when sharing your heart. Dipping your toe in the shallow end to test the temperature is a good place to start."
virgo,2015-10-22,"You long to express your ambitions creatively today, but it can be a scary proposition if you feel threatened by someone's harsh criticism. You might believe you're being unnecessarily singled out, yet your immediate reaction may be overstated. Fortunately, you're in a much stronger position now than you think and there's no need to defend your motives or fight back with your sharp tongue. Just follow your original plan and others will applaud when they see you in action. The proof is in the pudding."
libra,2015-10-22,"Although you may be feeling on edge today because everyone is busy pursuing their own interests, you have a natural ability to cope gracefully as the airy Aquarius Moon harmonizes with the Sun in peace-seeking Libra. Nevertheless, people might act irresponsibly when it comes to meeting their obligations; thankfully, you're repeatedly able to reestablish your balance with ease. Don't be afraid to make an important decision now, even if you wish you could keep your options open longer. Whether or not you can rely on anyone else, your instincts will lead you in the right direction."
scorpio,2015-10-22,"You wish you could fast-forward reality to get through this rocky part of your journey. However, your life is in better shape now than you realize, even if you're having trouble shaking off free-floating anxiety. It's just that you crave more emotional stability and the current uncertainty may trigger unusual feelings of helplessness or fear today. It's understandable to feel uneasy when your relationships or finances are in transition. Thankfully, focusing on the myriad of possibilities ahead enables you to be more positive in the present moment."
sagittarius,2015-10-22,"Your social life is in the midst of turmoil today, yet your inner voice continues to quietly sing, ""Everything's going to be alright."" Unfortunately, you may be strangely reluctant to listen to your optimistic instincts when it comes to your relationships. However, circumstances could spiral out of control if you allow yourself to lose hope. Maintain your spiritual equilibrium now; the strength of your convictions will gently lead you through the maze of confusion. Success is yours as long as you keep the faith."
capricorn,2015-10-22,"You are deeply committed to the long haul when it comes to your career. Obstacles that pop up in your path only increase your resolve to succeed. But you may wonder now if you made a bad decision along the way, especially if you're not climbing the proverbial ladder as fast as you expected. Nevertheless, continue your disciplined approach to your daily routine without making major adjustments today; your sincere efforts will begin to bear fruit very soon. Perseverance is your secret to success."
aquarius,2015-10-22,"It seems as if lightning is striking all around you, yet you're not in any immediate danger now. Remain emotionally available in your relationships, even if you feel the impulse to isolate yourself from others. Ultimately, your security derives from facing your fears about being alone. All you need to do is accept the current ambiguity along with your independence. There's no reason to fix anything today; just enjoy the electricity in the air and do your best to stay out of trouble."
pisces,2015-10-22,"You might try to shirk off the responsibility for your current situation, but it's not helpful to blame the crisis of the moment on external circumstances. There's a lot more going on than anyone realizes; it's just that you may not know which feelings to trust. Rather than looking to someone else for your answers, tap into your inner fountain of wisdom. Let your emotions come and go without attachment. When you can find your peace in the calm eye of the hurricane, the storm will quickly pass."
aries,2015-10-23,"It's a wizardly day, overflowing with the potential of magic. However, you must be willing to surrender to unseen forces if you want to benefit from this cosmic collaboration. Your spells and enchantments can cook up an intense emotional feast, but it may prove impossible to control the menu once you begin. The real power is found when you set aside your original recipe and follow your intuition. Dance with the unknown and you will not fail to impress even the most cynical of your critics."
taurus,2015-10-23,"You are quite single-minded when it comes to pursuing pleasure today as sensual Venus hooks up with unrelenting Pluto. Your feelings are so intense that you might not know how to keep your cool as you try to contain your emotions. Everything seems to assume cosmic proportions now, yet you may not want to say anything at all because you believe that your words will only get you into more trouble. It's okay to remain quiet as long as you are still willing to remain in touch with your heart."
gemini,2015-10-23,"Reality can hit you hard today and you might not know whether to be ecstatic or afraid. Rest assured that both emotions are likely appropriate responses, even if they seem to be mutually exclusive. The planetary currents are pulling you into deep emotional waters and you can't use your normal intellectual tools to stay on course. In fact, you may reach a point where you simply give up trying to figure out what to do next. Once you accept that your feelings don't need to be fixed, anything is possible."
cancer,2015-10-23,"Your strong convictions empower your actions and speech as long as you express yourself authentically. You Crabs are more sensitive to the shifting emotional tides than most people realize. As the currents build now, you might be prompted to act on a primal instinct. Although a swift decision may be your best move, make sure you aren't initiating unnecessary changes based upon your fears or you could inadvertently turn them into reality. No matter what the question is, love is the only answer."
leo,2015-10-23,"Your powerful romantic desires surprise you today, because they may not be as bright and cheery as you normally entertain. The sunshine is hiding behind the clouds, blocking your natural light. You might even feel emotionally overwhelmed, which can elicit anxiety over the littlest of things. Remember, there's no need to share all of your feelings now. Consciously choose to settle your energy with a simple statement of intention. Stay calm by traveling to your internal happy place, even if you are scared. With the right motivation, you can wait this storm out and emerge stronger than ever."
virgo,2015-10-23,"Don't even bother attempting to keep up the image of a neat and tidy Virgo as your tightly-wound emotions begin to unravel today. A minor tropical depression is being upgraded into a full-blown hurricane, complete with powerful waves of passion that can overpower your analytical walls of containment. The truth is this storm could prove to be a memorable experience, stirring up enough feelings to remind you of the complexities of your heart. Put on your rain boots and don't be afraid to get wet."
libra,2015-10-23,"The more immersed you are in the details today, the less you seem to know. Instead of sorting through all the facts about so many people, places and things, let your feelings take over the helm. You won't get pretty images, meaningless chatter or random interactions while your key planet Venus receives her instructions from survival-oriented Pluto. Abandon intellectual restraint and act on what you desire, rather than what others expect. If you want profundity and passion in your life now, all you need to do is ask."
scorpio,2015-10-23,"You grow weary today when the cosmos just keeps handing you the same old line. Romantic Venus harmonizes with your key planet Pluto, motivating you to take a calculated risk in order to achieve the emotional satisfaction you seek. Travel to the depths; then go even deeper. Feel it all, the love and the pain. You already know that your thoughts are merely a distraction from the desires of heart. A magical metamorphosis is close at hand if you believe in yourself as much as you believe in your dreams."
sagittarius,2015-10-23,"Although these may be uncertain times, filled with potential hazards, you're quite hopeful about your professional trajectory today. Your determination is admirable; you're ready to knuckle down and take your work more seriously than ever. Take time out from your busy schedule to reconstruct the last few weeks in your mind and then consciously project your positive intentions forward. You're standing at a powerful threshold now, and whatever aspirations you set into motion will have a long-lasting impact."
capricorn,2015-10-23,"Although you're obsessed with fulfilling your obligations today, it's smart to step back and spend time mapping out your plans for next year. But remember, reality is not what it appears to be; your attitude determines what you perceive. The current changes can be quite dramatic, especially if you are inclined to resist the inevitable. But don't be afraid of going on a spiritual journey as you explore your attractions and desires. The future is what you make it."
aquarius,2015-10-23,"Maintaining a comfortable level of emotional detachment can be an uphill battle today. You long to share your feelings, but may be afraid of exposing your vulnerability for fear of rejection. This approach-avoidance conflict raises long-standing relationship issues. Be patient; you won't receive answers to all your questions right away. You are engaged in a profound emotional dance that invites reality to lead, whether you know it or not. You will end up with a great story to tell if you trust your heart and move with the music."
pisces,2015-10-23,"You may not be in the mood to play around because you have more urgent relationship business to attend to now. Your heart is open wide and you don't want to miss an opportunity to engage your passions while magnetic Venus in your 7th House of Others trines powerful Pluto. Nevertheless, there's also an inescapable gnawing fear of the unknown. Don't try to talk yourself out of this journey. Fortune favors the bold."
aries,2015-10-24,"You may try to hide from the spotlight today because you feel like you have more freedom if you are not in plain view. It's not that you are afraid of being seen; it's just you're uncertain about your direction now and you want enough time to contemplate your options before others start chiming in with their opinions. Unfortunately, the feedback you receive from even well-meaning friends could pull you off course. Resist the urge to spill the beans for another day or two so you can develop your ideas on your own. Your independent nature and enterprising spirit serve you well."
taurus,2015-10-24,"You might experience a sudden change of heart today, leaving you with the urge to shout your feelings from the rooftop. Ironically, your passionate declaration can actually hide your immediate intentions rather than express them. You must pay attention to how someone might misinterpret your words, since the meaning could get lost in your current idealism. Keep in mind that most people don't want to be dragged into your internal process. It doesn't make sense to indiscriminately tell everyone your news; save your personal sentiments for your closest supporters who know you better than anyone else."
gemini,2015-10-24,"You aren't easily lured off track today because you are willing to adapt to the needs of others without losing sight of your own goals. Nevertheless, your desire to make everyone happy might be misunderstood now. Don't waste time explaining your motives if anyone suggests that your flexibility is a sign of weakness. In fact, you demonstrate your strength best when you bend in the breeze like a supple willow tree while holding onto your position with confidence."
cancer,2015-10-24,"Telling others what you want is complicated, even when you're in touch with your feelings. You aren't interested in showing your vulnerability now because of how much energy it takes to protect your heart. However, you probably have less to defend than you think, especially if you are speaking to a friendly audience. Although there's no need to say too much in public today, don't put up unnecessary walls with those who are your biggest fans. Knowing who you can trust is key to your happiness."
leo,2015-10-24,"Although your fantasies are irresistibly captivating today, you're still searching for a more balanced approach to your life. The surreal Pisces Moon might entangle you in the magic of your dreams, but you need to snap back to reality when the reverie ends. Nothing can prevent you from cherishing your beautiful illusions, even if you must be present in the here and now. Dancing in both worlds inspires you to do your best work."
virgo,2015-10-24,"On one hand, you intrinsically know that others depend on you to be the most responsible person in the room, and you're eager to meet their expectations. But on the other hand, you're itching for a bit of excitement and yearn to take an uncharacteristic risk today. Although there's no immediate danger, it still makes sense to double-check the facts before doing anything you will soon regret. Exercising a little caution at the right moment paves the way for a safe and amazing adventure."
libra,2015-10-24,"It's a fantastic day to lose yourself in a romantic fairy tale or to tap into your creative powers. Luckily, you may be magically inspired by your relationship with someone special today. Although you might have a lovely time in the imaginative realms, your thoughts could also manifest in the real world. Nevertheless, don't be sad if reality doesn't match your idyllic expectations. Finding small ways to incorporate your dreams into your daily life sets the tone for a brighter future."
scorpio,2015-10-24,"You're feeling picky about your social activities today because you don't want to waste precious time. Nevertheless, you might accept an enticing invitation if you can limit your involvement. Unfortunately, circumstances beyond your control may turn a minor commitment into a major drama. Instead of trying to stuff things back in the box, it's best to just breathe and allow events to play out on their own. Don't panic; you can reclaim your personal space once everything quiets down. Knowing when to go with the flow is your secret to successfully weathering the storm."
sagittarius,2015-10-24,"Although playtime is a top priority today, don't overdo it or you could miss out on an extraordinary opportunity for personal growth. Instead of dutifully fulfilling your family obligations, change your attitude so you can enjoy yourself, even if you don't get to have as much fun as you want. However, The emotional Pisces Moon sensitizes your 4th House of Emotional Roots, rewarding you for creating time for introspection. Recovering hidden treasure from the recesses of your subconscious is a cause worthy of pursuit."
capricorn,2015-10-24,"You might accomplish a lot around the house today, but it's not the relaxing day you had in mind. Part of the problem is you have this nagging thought that you're forgetting something important. Paradoxically, this nervous energy isn't dependent on your level of productivity, so don't base your emotional security on the expectations of the outer world. If you can find joy in each little achievement, you will be happy no matter what circumstances you face. Your confidence must come from within."
aquarius,2015-10-24,"It's a wonderful time to reconnect with your soul's purpose if you don't have to handle too many interpersonal dynamics. The cosmic energy is working in your favor now, but you might wonder if you really deserve everything you receive while the Moon shines in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Although some of your ideas may seem to be a bit disconnected with reality, your friends will likely encourage you to follow your dreams, anyhow. If you start with the premise that anything is possible, there's a strong probability that you will find it to be true."
pisces,2015-10-24,"Discovering a new way of perceiving your talents is likely as the intuitive Pisces Moon illuminates your 1st House of Self. But it's not easy to believe in yourself now, especially if you recently doubted your role in the world. You don't have to slink off into the dark shadows today if you're unsure of your next move. Luckily, you can cultivate magic by crossing over to the sunny side of the street. Your light grows brighter when you focus on making the world a better place."
aries,2015-10-25,"Cosmic light bulbs flash, illuminating your mind today, and you are eager to share your brilliant new ideas with anyone who will listen. You're wired for action and may be quite pleased with your own ingenuity. Unfortunately, you have an attention span of a kitten; you will likely lose interest in what you're doing before you gain traction. But don't worry if nothing comes to fruition now; your current thoughts will continue to evolve into something even better. Inspiration is alive and magic is afoot."
taurus,2015-10-25,"A spontaneous shift in your thinking could be precipitated by someone who decides to change shared plans without necessarily telling you first. This unilateral decision can be problematic because it impacts the rest of your day, too. You might be resistant to adjusting your schedule for the sake of anyone else, but it's not wise to be fixed in your ways today. Instead, demonstrate your cooperative spirit by being as accommodating as possible. You'll gain more respect if others see you as a team player who's willing to put the best interests of the group ahead of your own."
gemini,2015-10-25,"You would like to be known as a responsible person who your friends, family and community can rely on. However, you may not be fully committed to walking your talk today. Although others could have high expectations, you might not be interested in paying the price to earn the appreciation you want. Instead of wasting your time spinning idle fantasies now, show up and play your part to the best of your ability. Even if the role isn't your first choice, the rewards can still bring a surprising amount of emotional satisfaction."
cancer,2015-10-25,"You can hear the future calling your name today, and you yearn to get things rolling in that direction. But you aren't sure whether or not to take this cosmic message seriously. Rest assured this career opportunity is worth pursuing, so don't bother wondering if it's real or not. Just answer the pull of your heartstrings and explore all the possibilities. Engaging in a thought-provoking dialogue is one of the best ways to discover the next path you wish to take."
leo,2015-10-25,"You feel connected to someone special today, only to suddenly experience an awkward distance between you for no apparent reason. Your partner's unexpected behavior could be upsetting to your heart and perplexing to your mind. Fortunately, it won't take you long to recover your balance, but you may keep your defenses up for a while to be on the safe side. It's fine to retreat a bit, but don't back up so far that you end up isolating yourself from the ones who love you the most."
virgo,2015-10-25,"You see every event as another potential escape route, but searching for a way to break out of a rut isn't enough today. Unfortunately, you might let a chance to try something new slip by without giving it a fair shot. Taking a risk sounds better than it actually is, because you believe that you will be happier if you stick to what's already familiar. Although avoiding change seems like the safer choice now, ignoring your desires could precipitate an unexpected chain of actions that you cannot control. Follow your initial instinct to shake things up a bit and let the cards fall where they may."
libra,2015-10-25,"A sudden break in your routine catches you off guard today. At first, it may seem as if someone else's refusal to cooperate with you further complicates your day. But this twist of fate can work to your advantage by triggering your sense of independence. If nothing out of the ordinary occurs, go ahead and stir up some mischief on your own. Ultimately, something must change now and if you don't make it happen, the cosmos might just do it for you."
scorpio,2015-10-25,"A burst of enthusiasm sets you into motion today, even if you feel stuck in a familiar pattern. You might attempt to initiate overdue improvements, but little will come of your efforts if you act prematurely. Waiting until you can sense that the time is right is key to your transformation. Your dedication to creating change will be rewarded with a high level of accomplishment, but it could take a few days before you fully appreciate the power of your personal evolution."
sagittarius,2015-10-25,"Although you may wish you could let your commitments slide today, your conscience gnaws at you, reminding you that you must do what you promised. But you might not be feeling your usual zest for life now; instead you could attempt a half-hearted effort just to get by. Unfortunately, your current detachment can create additional problems if you pretend that everything is okay when it's not. Even you Archers are entitled to an off day every now and then. Counting your blessings gently puts your life back in proper perspective."
capricorn,2015-10-25,"Maintaining control over your own schedule now is unlikely if family members don't cooperate as you had hoped. Even if you're upset about your plans falling apart today, don't shift the blame to anyone else. No matter how it appears to you, no one is trying to sabotage your efforts. It might come as a surprise, but the cause of your current instability is you. Making a concerted effort to transform your inner dynamics changes external events, as if by magic. Your positive attitude generates a ripple of good vibrations that can spread far and wide."
aquarius,2015-10-25,"You might not be able to turn your plans into reality because you encounter some interesting twists and turns that completely change the direction of your day. An unforeseen event could send you into an emotional tailspin if you try to cling to the past. However, this may prove to be a pivotal moment if you're ready to launch into the unknown. Rigid thinking turns small problems into larger ones; operating with an enlightened heart and an open mind makes the world a fascinating place."
pisces,2015-10-25,"Hiding your feelings is impossible while the Moon lingers in your sign. Your recent disclosure pays off today as people rally to your side. Nevertheless, your sudden emotional outburst may shock others once the Moon marches into hotheaded Aries. Don't hold back; expressing your thoughts spontaneously might be just what's needed to encourage someone else to say what's on his or her mind, too. It's up to you to take the lead by sharing your heart so everyone feels safe to follow your shining example."
aries,2015-10-26,"You may be accustomed to the repetitive waves of energy that periodically surge through your life these days. But the Moon's current visit to your sign is another reminder of the big changes looming everywhere you turn. You are experiencing a bit of a cosmic roller-coaster ride today and could be easily overwhelmed by your emotions. Opening your heart to a friend might make you feel uncomfortable at first, but will ultimately calm your nerves and help you reestablish your center. Everyone needs someone to lean on sometimes."
taurus,2015-10-26,"Social commitments are stacking up on your calendar, making you realize that you don't have much time to spare. You may need to clarify your boundaries by saying no if you've managed to spread yourself too thin. But it's not that you're choosing to be antisocial; it's simply that you have too much on your plate. Avoid unproductive distractions now, even if you are feeling the urge to escape your obligations. Focus on your agenda and you'll be through this crunch sooner than you expect."
gemini,2015-10-26,"You want people to believe that you're eagerly embracing the future. You might even pretend that all is perfect in your world today, but you're afraid of being harshly judged if you admit to holding onto the past. Although you're usually adept at steering clear of unnecessary emotional drama, your impulsive actions could inadvertently stir up an uncomfortable level of intensity now. Being honest about your fears is the first step to resolving your insecurities. Revealing your vulnerability allows others to know the real you."
cancer,2015-10-26,"Your urge to be spontaneous could be constrained by memories of a past rejection that arise when you swing into motion. Luckily, reviewing your personal history enables you to learn from previous mistakes and push through the current resistance. No matter what happens, taking the initiative boosts your self-esteem and gives you the courage to ask for what you want. Act on your feelings instead of just experiencing them so that the universe knows you mean business."
leo,2015-10-26,"A powerful surge of confidence inspires you to put an untried idea into definitive motion. You can do nearly anything you set your mind to while the Moon lights up your adventurous 9th House of Big Ideas. You have sufficient momentum to plan for the future, even if you haven't yet processed the unfolding dynamics of the present moment. Fortunately, you don't need to figure out everything all at once; examine all the angles while the universe works its magic on your behalf."
virgo,2015-10-26,"You're craving new experiences today, but reality is telling you to hold your horses. You may be bound to promises you made in a relationship, but something happens that reawakens your desires and re-energizes your passion for living. However, you cannot just forget about your commitments and sail off into the sunset without letting others in on your plans. It's best to make drastic changes on another day rather than turning your life upside down now and regretting it later."
libra,2015-10-26,"Defining the line between love and codependency is particularly tricky now, especially because making other people happy comes so naturally to you. The Moon's emphasis on your 7th House of Relationships highlights how difficult it is to be completely yourself today when someone else's needs conflict with yours. Although honoring your heart might create a ripple of stress at first, it also makes you a better partner in the long run. An equal amount of give and take is essential for a happy and healthy partnership."
scorpio,2015-10-26,"You're walking close to an emotional edge today, but it's wise to keep your feelings to yourself. Your patience has run out and you're on the threshold of doing something that you might later regret. There may be too much at stake to take an unnecessary risk now, so try working off your anxiety through physical exercise or hard work. You'll feel much better if you channel your nervous tension into something positive that you can be proud of at the end of the day."
sagittarius,2015-10-26,"You are sorely tempted to gamble with your heart because you're feeling lucky in love today. Maintaining a positive attitude is almost always a good rule to follow, but your sunny optimism might be too much of a good thing now. Putting your feelings out there won't necessarily lead to failure, but choosing a proven path improves your chances for success even more. Give others time to reflect on your disclosure; relaxing your expectations helps you avoid unnecessary disappointment. Love is a dance which can't be rushed."
capricorn,2015-10-26,"Although you possess an ambitious plan to reach your goals, your foundation may be weak if you don't trust your perceptions. You might be so self-critical now that you assume you can't sustain your productivity as you move into unfamiliar territory. You could exhaust yourself before you reach your destination if you are pushing too hard. Paradoxically, slowing down today can actually help you achieve success quicker than you think. Whatever you do, don't stop believing in yourself."
aquarius,2015-10-26,"You may be spinning your wheels today, distracted by one little thing after another. However, karma gets you every time you wander away from your work and immediately sets you back on track. You don't have a lot of time to waste if you want to complete the tasks in front of you. Maintain clear intentions and stay singularly focused on your goals if you hope to accomplish everything on your list. Sadly, sometimes all work and no play is the only solution."
pisces,2015-10-26,"You recently embarked on an exciting new path, but you could encounter complications today as someone blocks your way. In fact, the resistance you receive might make you wonder if you're headed in the right direction. However, there's no reason to get discouraged; the current obstacles are meant to help you get serious about your work rather than preventing any further progress. Don't throw in the towel now; your perseverance is absolutely essential for bringing your project into the future. Where there's a will, there's a way."
aries,2015-10-27,"You are acutely aware of what is missing from a significant relationship today. Nevertheless, you may still feel pretty calm and confident as the steadfast Taurus Full Moon sheds her light in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. However, you could also feel the thrilling spark of inspiration by discovering a simple solution to a complex problem. But don't assume you can make your dreams come true just because you are committed to taking a practical approach now. You must express what's in your heart if you want others to join in the dance."
taurus,2015-10-27,"It's healthy to ask difficult questions as you search for the hidden meaning of life. Nevertheless, the Taurus Full Moon brightens your 1st House of Personality, revealing more about your emotional uncertainty than you prefer. Responding to people's assumptions about your inner process is a challenging task today. Thankfully, you will have plenty of opportunities over the next couple of weeks to process all the knowledge you learn about your most valuable relationships. Never underestimate the power of a beginner's mind when it comes to matters of the heart."
gemini,2015-10-27,"Your self-protective mechanism swings into operation today, camouflaging your true feelings and keeping your heart safe. The Taurus Full Moon lands in your 12th House of Secrets, reminding you of how much your fantasies impact your daily life. Luckily, you won't have to work so hard to suppress your dreams once you acknowledge the difference between illusion and reality. Although it isn't easy to pin down your emotions now, it helps to stick to the basics. No matter how tempting it is to space out, your common sense will ultimately see you through the confusion."
cancer,2015-10-27,"You are typically comfortable with your changing moods but you might go out of your way to avoid them today. The fixed Taurus Full Moon illuminates your 11th House of Social Networking, encouraging you to seek stability in the midst of a crowd. Happily, your friends and associates provide you with a reliable emotional anchor that can moderate the vagaries of your passions. Leaning on others is fine as long as you don't let them talk you out of your feelings. Even if your desires take you places that make you temporarily nervous, it's important to stay in touch with your heart."
leo,2015-10-27,"You're riding waves of irrepressible feelings that could test the mettle of your professional relationships now. You may be questioning how much of your emotional life to bring into the workplace while the Taurus Full Moon highlights your 10th House of Career. You would like others to know more about you, but you don't want to overwhelm them with drama that could detract from your performance on the job. Being transparent with those you trust makes sense, but otherwise err on the side of caution when it comes to personal disclosure."
virgo,2015-10-27,"If you already have a plan in motion for reaching the stars, then it's crucial to stick to it as closely as possible now. However, if you're flying by the seat of your pants, the earthy Taurus Full Moon offers you a chance to create a sensible strategy as it reinforces your 9th House of Big Ideas. You can achieve your dreams, but don't get carried away with your enthusiasm. Focusing on the simplest tasks enables you to end up at the most distant destination by taking one small step at a time."
libra,2015-10-27,"Your life may be so loud now that you are tempted to escape into your dreams to ponder the mysteries of the cosmos. Although the steady Taurus Full Moon offers you a solid place to stand while exploring your 8th House of Metamorphosis, the shifting sands of reality are not as stable as they seem. It's impossible to see around the corner today because a major transformation is in process. Don't try to hold onto old assumptions. The more willing you are to let go of the past, the brighter the future will be."
scorpio,2015-10-27,"You might believe that your interpersonal communication skills aren't as effective as you  wish. However, your prime directive is changing as your thoughts turn inward to reconnect you with your spiritual core. Today's Taurus Full Moon shines in your 7th House of Partners, reflecting your feelings back to you through another person's perspective. Forget about the complicated issues that plague your life and the little details that fill your day. For now, keep everything as simple as possible while sharing your heart in the present moment with someone you love."
sagittarius,2015-10-27,"You are reconsidering the promises you made at work and are willing to renegotiate your commitments, if necessary. The down-to-earth Taurus Full Moon grounds your 6th House of Daily Routine, advising you that a pragmatic approach to your job is wiser now than harboring unrealistic ambitions. Be satisfied with your current position today, instead of plotting and scheming to get further ahead. Patiently listening to what others want enables you to bargain more effectively for what you need in the long run."
capricorn,2015-10-27,"You're eager to indulge in pleasure today, but you're still not willing to slack off and let your commitments fall to the wayside. Luckily, you're the happy recipient of positive cosmic vibes while the sensual Taurus Full Moon dances in your 5th House of Play. Put your artistic talents to work. Focus on your dreams, even if they momentarily seem unattainable, and they will play a growing role in the coming weeks. Let your creative brilliance be a guiding light not only for yourself, but for the rest of the world, too."
aquarius,2015-10-27,"You may be trying so hard to inspire others at work that it creates static at home. Family issues must be addressed while the Taurus Full Moon settles into your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. Luckily, your current dilemma won't be dramatic enough to throw you off track, since you have your priorities in order and can manage the temporary stress. Nevertheless, don't pretend that everything is fine if it is not; others will quickly see through any attempts to embellish the truth. For the sake of simplicity, be honest right from the start."
pisces,2015-10-27,"Share your current plans with your closest friends as soon as you can, for it will only become more complicated the longer you wait. Oddly enough, people may seem overly irritated today if you aren't willing to express your point of view. However, the Taurus Full Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication, reminding you that honesty is the best policy. Nevertheless, once you start explaining your opinions, it might be hard to stop before you end up saying too much. A little objective self-regulation tilts the scales in your favor."
aries,2015-10-28,"Although everything will likely fit into place, you still must rely on your own initiative if you are driven to finish what you start. Your day may begin slowly, yet like a surfer, you must paddle faster to catch the big wave. Oddly enough, it might be better now for you to just let this one wash over you and not show off with any fancy tricks. Surrender the fight and relax; instead of relentlessly pursuing your goals, kick back and just enjoy floating in the deep blue sea today. Appreciate the  view while you have the chance."
taurus,2015-10-28,"You could grow overly concerned about your appearance today while the reflective Moon hanging in your 1st House of Physicality trines captivating Venus. Although wearing something that makes you feel extra attractive gets the day off to a proper start, remember that looks are only skin-deep. True beauty originates from within, so stay busy cultivating your spiritual side, too. Don't forget your eyes are the windows to your soul. And a smile is only memorable if it comes from the heart."
gemini,2015-10-28,"Hurry up and finish up old business today because you will be anxious to start something new tomorrow. Getting closure on a project or a relationship issue requires you to stick with the process, even if your natural tendency is to move on as soon as you are bored. Nevertheless, your tenacity pays off now because you can discover hidden treasure by applying determination and discipline. Kite-flying aficionado Ben Franklin said, ""Energy and persistence conquer all things."""
cancer,2015-10-28,"Your true friends will stand by you no matter what, and even rush to your rescue if you need it. Thankfully, you're not looking for anyone to bail you out of a crisis now; it's just that you feel emotionally secure when you know that you can depend on others. But there doesn't have to be a problem for you to call on your friends today. Simply going out to lunch with a couple of casual acquaintances or having a few of your buddies over for dinner could be just the right thing to set your world right."
leo,2015-10-28,"The spotlight is following you even if you're not trying to draw attention to your activities. However, your ability to see a task through to completion puts you on a pedestal with your peers since they rely on your sense of duty and generosity of spirit. You have exactly what it takes to get the job done today as long as you don't lose sight of your long-term objectives. Just work hard and your sincere efforts will eventually be appreciated, whether or not anyone is watching now. Striving to be your best self allows your integrity to shine."
virgo,2015-10-28,"You are dreaming of an exotic place today as a means of escape. Luckily, you might just get to take that trip if you maintain a practical attitude. But since you may choose to embark on a journey of the mind instead, use your time wisely by increasing your global awareness. Grab any opportunity to learn something new about another  country you wish to visit someday, even if you can't pack your bags now. A sense of wanderlust blows a fresh breeze of creativity into every corner of your life."
libra,2015-10-28,"An intriguing matter lures you into solving a perplexing puzzle, even if it becomes a temporary obsession. Your determination is unshakable now, but you should perform a quick reality check to make sure you aren't sliding off into a world of illusion and fantasy. Although you might try to adopt a rational approach, the Moon's presence in your 8th House of Metamorphosis inspires you to persist until you get to the bottom of what's going on. Don't sell yourself short; there's no reason to end your search until you discover the truth."
scorpio,2015-10-28,"You typically don't mind dealing with emotional complexities because they enable you to get in touch with the deeper meaning of life. However, you're seeking the more obvious answers now instead of the esoteric ones. There's nothing complicated about wanting to snuggle with a loved one or appreciating the blessings of a satisfying meal and a good night's rest. Everything would be so easy if life was always that simple and straightforward. Scorpions love a good mystery more than any other sign; nevertheless, the littlest pleasures can be enough to warm your heart today."
sagittarius,2015-10-28,"Focusing on your physical health is a smart idea today, even if you are currently feeling as invincible as a superhero with one-too-many superpowers. Fortunately, you can make little improvements to your lifestyle now that create long-lasting consequences. You could try something as simple as making a few small dietary changes or switching up your exercise routine. You don't have to disrupt your entire life; even a minor adjustment will have an enduring positive impact on your future."
capricorn,2015-10-28,"You are probably more preoccupied with the logistics of love today than with the sensitive  emotional issues. Paradoxically, this doesn't make you any less of a romantic; it's just that you're temporarily focused on the practical considerations at hand. One strategy is to think about how you could be a better partner or lover now. Then follow up by doing whatever you can to strengthen the bond of your current or potential relationship. It's true, the best things in life are free, but you still must invest your heart if you want love to stay."
aquarius,2015-10-28,"Your active imagination is soaring far above the mundane issues of the real world today. Memories of your childhood flood into your awareness like a rising tide, stimulating an uncomfortable sense of nostalgia. You normally have a rather pragmatic outlook on your past, but everything is seen through a soft-focus filter now. Enjoy your flights of fancy, but don't linger too long in the shadows or you might get lost. Traveling back in time can inspire your plans for the future in ways you never imagined."
pisces,2015-10-28,"Although you wish you could coast through the day, the cosmos has different plans for you. Some of the current distractions come from within, rather than the external world. Your brain might be full even if your calendar is quiet. You may even feel like a stage magician who must juggle one too many balls while trying to keep the rabbit from jumping out of the hat. Act decisively and set a few things aside so everyone can see you perform at your very best."
aries,2015-10-29,"Although you might think you fixed a problem at work, your confidence doesn't mean you actually found resolution in the real world. You may incorrectly assume that changing your attitude is enough to alleviate the current stress, but there are still many more improvements to make now. However, you won't be able to move forward until you admit that there is an important lesson to learn. Once you acknowledge you don't have all the answers, opportunities will start to materialize everywhere you look. Humility is your friend."
taurus,2015-10-29,"Completing tasks that produce immediate consequences minimizes the pressure of the larger issues you are wrestling with now. Unfortunately, diverting your attention is only a temporary solution. Nevertheless, you can accomplish a lot today by narrowing your focus. After you cross off some of the chores on your to-do list, it's wise to reassess your long-term goals, even if you don't reach any lasting conclusions. Keep your eyes and ears open; clues and signs will pop up in the unlikeliest of places."
gemini,2015-10-29,"You can handle nearly anything today as long as you understand that it could take a while for positive results to manifest. Thankfully, the current stress won't spin out of control if you maintain your vigilance. Although persistence might be your secret weapon now, it's a full-time endeavor to keep up with your work. Temporarily putting your personal needs on the back burner is your smartest strategy while you demonstrate your dedication to your job. All work and no play leads to success."
cancer,2015-10-29,"An unresolved family matter requires plenty of your emotional bandwidth today, but smoothing over the rough spots at home needs to be your top priority. At first, you may believe that avoiding your domestic concerns is enough to make them go away. But playing this kind of evasive mind game isn't helpful; be proactive and discuss the delicate issues with those who are directly involved in the drama. Even if nothing is fixed immediately, initiating an honest dialogue gets the ball rolling toward a positive resolution."
leo,2015-10-29,"The fervor of emotional intensity is challenging to manage today, but you're ready to swing into action to reestablish stability in your environment. Developing a plan to reduce your anxiety is one thing, while actually putting your ideas into motion is entirely something else. The complexity of the situation might make you want to throw in the towel. But don't hang your head in discouragement; you can turn the tide in your favor now, even if everything takes more time than you wish. Take several deep breaths and then let peace begin with you."
virgo,2015-10-29,"You're willing to try every trick in the book to eliminate the current stress in an important relationship. Unfortunately, the harder you attempt to make someone else happy now, the more awkward the dynamics become. Ironically, your most effective strategy might be to simply observe the situation without doing anything about it. Let the tension settle on its own. It may take a few days for things to play out, but you can expect calmer times ahead if you don't lose your cool today."
libra,2015-10-29,"Your first conclusion won't likely be your final solution to a lingering problem on the job. Your coworkers may be waiting for you to weigh in with your answer today, but you're not pleased with any of the available options. Although you would prefer to add a few extra alternatives to the mix, more possibilities will only complicate matters now. Even if you think there is a better plan, no one will fault you for going along with the consensus of the group. Sometimes acquiescing for the sake of harmony is more important than being right."
scorpio,2015-10-29,"You may be obsessing about issues of integrity today, yet the current circumstances are even more complex than they seem. Someone might ask you to intervene in a way that could reflect negatively on your reputation. Instead of amplifying a minor concern into a major drama, simply state your feelings and then hold your ground. It's imperative that others know exactly where you stand now. Speak up for your beliefs to gain the respect you deserve."
sagittarius,2015-10-29,"You could take a circuitous detour today just to put your intentions out on the table. Although you are extremely serious about your feelings now, others might find your words evasive and your declarations of affection insincere. In fact, you may behave more defensively than you realize. New options appear when you begin to discern the differences between the actual conversation you're engaged in with another person and the one you're having with yourself. Communication is a two-way street."
capricorn,2015-10-29,"Your karma might be somewhat muddled now as your thoughts keep bumping into reality. Even if you can't see the direct correlation between cause and effect today, don't let your lack of clarity prevent you from making the right choice. All you need to do is to act with intention. Stay on course without letting doubt or fear deter your progress; happily, you will be closer to your destination when the mist begins to clear. Trust your moral compass to steer you in the right direction."
aquarius,2015-10-29,Telling the difference between your idealistic hopes and viable solutions is trickier than it sounds. You can create the most positive impact by simply concentrating on the facts and putting away your daydreams for another time. Avoid the temptation to drift off into imaginary worlds today. The real magic comes from taking the blinders off now and seeing life exactly as it is. Working in the three-dimensional plane produces the most extraordinary results.
pisces,2015-10-29,"Relationship dynamics grow even more complicated when you can't discern reality from your dreams. However, most of your current problems stem from your overactive imagination. Although your mind may be chock full of wonderful ideas and amazing possibilities, it's confusing if they seem so real when they're not. Instead of rushing ahead today, write your thoughts down to reconsider later; you can choose which ones to develop further when you are thinking more rationally. Sometimes there's no explaining the vagaries of the heart."
aries,2015-10-30,"Everything is quite simple as long as you don't allow the facts to stand in the way of having fun. The problem is that fantasy continues to rule your world now, even though the truth usually wins out in the end. Luckily, if you can imagine something today, you might actually be able to think it into existence. Nevertheless, cooperating with reality instead of avoiding it makes the road ahead easier to navigate. Taking life a little more seriously leads you down the right path."
taurus,2015-10-30,"It's nearly impossible to clearly define your strengths and weaknesses now, but your lack of objectivity won't impede your success. Even if your current role in the world is a bit muddled, your identity can be based more on your ideal vision rather than on the actual circumstances of your life. Give yourself permission to dream but don't lose track of the truth in the process. Incorporating the most meaningful parts of your fantasies into your daily routine makes life a more joyful experience."
gemini,2015-10-30,"You can't wait to escape into the beauty of an intellectual creation, whether or not you have a captive audience. Try your hand at writing poetry today or find a poem that touches your soul and read it aloud. In fact, music, art or any other creative outlet might do the trick. If you're feeling inspired, you could lose yourself in the moment and consciously invite your imagination to reveal a hidden treasure. Metaphysical riches are waiting beyond the rational world if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and explore the unknown."
cancer,2015-10-30,"Although meditation is a wonderful part of a healthy daily routine, too much contemplation might inadvertently lead you into a deep rut now. This mental trap lures you into experiencing powerful feelings that haven't yet bubbled into awareness. If you become overwhelmed or sad, step outside for some fresh air and a short walk. Gentle movement prevents your imagination from tilting in a negative direction today. Your spirituality can be the source of great inspiration if your head is in the right place."
leo,2015-10-30,"A close friend might send mixed signals today, making it difficult to decipher what is expected of you. Your confusion may impact an intimate relationship or a group dynamic, but you can't waste energy worrying about what others think. Your most sensible course of action now is to clear up any misunderstanding by asking questions and sorting out the facts. Acting on your compassion for those you love while still honoring your responsibilities in the mundane world allows you to cover all the bases. Sleep will have to wait."
virgo,2015-10-30,"It's like you are seeing the whole world through rose-colored glasses today, challenging you to admit that you don't have a clue as to what is real and what is an illusion. Your routine might fall to the wayside as you are enticed to step outside the narrow confines of your commitments. The trick is to realize you have more time than you think to finish up your chores and fulfill your obligations. Exploring the rainbow of possibilities is a lot more fun now than worrying about the logistics."
libra,2015-10-30,"Your admirable intention is to foster peace and harmony on this planet by ensuring that everyone around you is happy. Although others see you as sweet and friendly, you don't feel as if anyone understands your true motivation. The more you want good things to happen, the more resistance you seem to encounter today. Keep your hopes up even if you're not sure that things are going your way now. Above all, remember that the power of positive thinking can help you conquer your doubts and make the world a better place."
scorpio,2015-10-30,"A relationship dilemma currently stems from an imbalance of passion now. You long to share your emotions with someone you love, but everyone seems to prefer splashing around in the shallow end of the pool instead of swimming out into the deeper emotional waters. It's not that you need to hide your feelings, but it's tough to find someone who can match your intensity. Nevertheless, carefully considering the mood of your chosen audience enables you to successfully unburden your heart when the time is right."
sagittarius,2015-10-30,"You thought you knew everything there is to know about your relationship world, but now you realize that a significant piece of information may have been missed in the translation. Toss your old assumptions aside because they are irrelevant to the current circumstances. But all is not lost; everything should work out to your advantage if you can be flexible enough to go with the flow today. Whatever you do, don't try to force reality into your predetermined agenda when the universe has something so much better in store for you."
capricorn,2015-10-30,"It's a perfect day to fall in love with the idea of falling in love, but finding romance in the real world can be a cruel and fickle game. Beauty appears in many forms all around you now, but it's ultimately a reflection of what's within your mind. Be careful about confusing your subjective experience with the objective world. Maintaining a balanced perspective increases your chances of transforming your whimsical illusions into lasting reality. Let your heart shine brightly and others will be drawn to your light."
aquarius,2015-10-30,"Think your plans through extremely carefully if you are considering a major purchase. Unfortunately, you may be a little short on funds or common sense today. Even if you go ahead and open your wallet, remember that you can easily misjudge the value of what you are buying now. Finding something that is aesthetically pleasing is only half the battle. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but you still have to pay for your object of desire with real money. Performing a quick reality check will put your priorities in order."
pisces,2015-10-30,"A minor miscommunication between family members could twist the entire day out of shape before you know it. Nebulous Neptune may run amok with your life, but oddly enough, you still should be able to avoid trouble if you remain sensitive to the needs of others. Even if you must backtrack later to clear up a misunderstanding, make sure you straighten out any wrinkles on the home front before moving on. Taking the high road allows your compassionate nature to run the show."
aries,2015-10-31,"You are receiving mixed cosmic signals about how much to share with others while the sensitive Cancer Moon visits your private 4th House of Home and Family today. This confusing message is challenging because you would like to have your feelings acknowledged by those closest to you. Nevertheless, you also want to avoid unnecessarily placing yourself in a vulnerable position now. There's no need to feel overly anxious about whatever you decide to do, for your uncertainty will likely pass by tomorrow. In the meantime, channel your angst into your art."
taurus,2015-10-31,"Lovely images from your dreams soothe your recent restlessness, but answers won't likely come as easily as questions today, leaving you somewhat unsatisfied. Sometimes you grow nervous when reality is elusive, yet you're more intrigued now than concerned. Oddly enough, you're comfortable with partial solutions because you're confident that more details will be revealed when needed. In the meantime, allowing your imagination to color in the details opens new doors of creativity."
gemini,2015-10-31,"Although you may carve out some downtime for yourself today, you prefer to spend it in the company of close family or friends. Unfortunately, you might end up in the middle of a sudden argument with someone you love. This disagreement doesn't have to be a big deal; just don't issue any ultimatums about your relationship or things could take a darker turn. Thankfully, your differences of opinion can act as a catalyst for an emotional reconnection if both parties are willing to keep their hearts and minds open."
cancer,2015-10-31,"Disclosing your personal feelings comes naturally now that the evocative Moon is traveling through your sign. But this Luna alignment doesn't necessarily mean that everyone else wants to hear as much as you want to say. Reconsider your motives for sharing your emotions to be certain your heart is in the right place; if you wish to develop a deeper friendship with someone special, then don't wait for a better time than today. Being selective about your audience and your message ensures your success."
leo,2015-10-31,"Your plan is to reveal as little as absolutely necessary today. In fact, you may be like Cinderella at the ball, carrying around a few secrets of your own. The easiest way to sidestep unwanted attention is to pull someone else into the spotlight to entertain the crowd. Treat others with loving kindness and remember that it's okay to remain silent until you feel inspired to say more. In the meantime, your air of mystery casts you in a favorable light."
virgo,2015-10-31,"Your friends seem to go out of their way to include you in the fun today. However, you're more motivated by your need to feel socially connected than by a desire for pleasurable distractions. The Moon's presence in your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams puts you in touch with your goals and empowers you to share your preferences with the group. Fortunately, your wishes will likely come true as long as you have the courage to ask for what you want."
libra,2015-10-31,It's nearly impossible to tell in advance what you should do today because others seem ambiguous about their expectations. The Moon's visit to your 10th House of Status may indicate a new role for you to play within your community. Don't draw any conclusions prematurely. Adopt a wait-and-see approach now because your current situation is still in flux. Take advantage of the shifting tides and reassess what would make your heart happy without worrying about anyone else.
scorpio,2015-10-31,"You are not likely to listen to the advice of a close friend or mentor now because you are convinced that you see things very clearly on your own. You may be playing with a fascinating idea that keeps growing in scope today, but it's challenging to cut it back to a manageable size. However, your current view is warped by your subjectivity, so keep reminding yourself that often less is more when it comes to invention. Even the greatest thinkers know it never hurts to get a second opinion."
sagittarius,2015-10-31,"You're longing to get to know someone on a deeper level now, but you are clueless when it comes to  initiating a serious conversation. Before you build up your nerve and enlist the aid of your friends, it would be smart to re-evaluate your goals today because it's easy to trick yourself when the emotional Moon connects with confusing Neptune. This self-reflection won't require too much contemplation; just reconfirm that you really want to pursue this connection before anyone's heart is on the line."
capricorn,2015-10-31,"Discerning the source of a misunderstanding is  time-consuming business today, but it's critical to get to the bottom of the mystery, nonetheless. At first, it might appear as if others are purposefully leading you in the wrong direction, but upon closer scrutiny you can see how they may be working off of your mixed messages. Instead of trying to obtain additional clarity from anyone else, set an example and clear up your own muddled mind first. People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones."
aquarius,2015-10-31,"Happily, you can find quiet time today to finish up your incomplete chores. However, emotional complications arise, challenging you to stick to your schedule. You would prefer to stray from the straight and narrow path, but letting your mind wander isn't going to help you be any more productive. Honestly, time management isn't rocket science; just focus on the particulars until you are satisfied with your progress. Work now, play later."
pisces,2015-10-31,"You feel like a little kid now that the Moon is skipping through your 5th House of Spontaneity. But, paradoxically, sometimes acting in the moment is more joyful when you also plan in advance. Stabilize your most outrageous dreams by sharing them with your closest friends. Feeling confident about your creative talents will help you be more successful when it comes to achieving your goals. The support you receive from others acts as the wind beneath your wings."
aries,2015-11-01,"Unresolved partnership issues make you more impatient as the days go by, and you might not know which way to turn now. You don't enjoy being caught in the middle of an emotional drama; in fact, you prefer to skip some of the required responsibilities that come along with a relationship. Nevertheless, you're still aware of the potential for growth, even if you must confront your own discomfort to foster positive change. The truth is logic won't steer you in the right direction, so just follow your heart."
taurus,2015-11-01,"Your desire to establish solid connections with others could conflict with your growing need for solitude today. This emotional dichotomy may be frustrating, provoking you to strike out at someone who is supportive of your goals. Luckily, your unexpressed feelings don't have to be the primary focus of the day if you take the time to reexamine your goals. Clarifying your personal and professional commitments enables you to respond more sensibly and appreciate those who are on your side. Expressing your gratitude is the key to your happiness."
gemini,2015-11-01,"Thankfully, you could receive a much-needed reprieve from the recent hectic pace of your life. You may as well settle into the silence because you won't likely make much progress now even if you try. However, an unexpected emotional outburst on your part today might trigger someone else to overreact in turn. Honestly stating your needs as they arise allows you to avoid being sideswiped by your own unconscious feelings. Don't ask too many questions; just enjoy the peace and quiet while you can."
cancer,2015-11-01,"The Moon's current amble through your nurturing sign may be the start of something new, even if you're not yet eager to forge ahead. Thankfully, you will have a good shot at reaching your goals as long as you take the extra time you need to explore all of your options. Pushing too hard could inadvertently stir up a hornet's nest of resistance today. Be patient; it's smarter to chill out now and try again once the energy settles down. Timing is everything."
leo,2015-11-01,"Your friends may tempt you to play a round of Truth or Dare today, even if you know better than to engage in games when you have more important concerns on your mind. Their eloquent words inspire you to act more spontaneously, but the power of the present moment isn't all that matters when you have your hopes pinned on the future. Ultimately, it's smarter to err on the side of discretion and confess your secrets on another day. There's no need to succumb to peer pressure; sometimes it's okay to simply smile and just say no."
virgo,2015-11-01,"Take a few steps backward to reevaluate your long-term goals, especially if you feel pressured to initiate action today. Instead of being coerced into a bad decision, retreat to maintain your current position. You recently learned a valuable lesson and now you want to teach others how to achieve success. Integrate your feelings into your social interactions by sharing what's in your heart. Your wisdom can act as an emotional catalyst to inspire someone else's journey."
libra,2015-11-01,"You may face a stressful emotional dilemma while the moody Cancer Moon creates anxious aspects with several planets today. Your unexpressed negativity intensifies if you make light of what you are enduring. Although your defenses are likely strong enough to keep others at bay now, you'll feel better if you include your friends in your process instead of just trying to pretend you are okay on your own. Sharing a burden with someone you trust is all it takes to lighten your load."
scorpio,2015-11-01,"It feels as if relief is on the way now, but there aren't any angels magically winging their way to your rescue just yet. Therefore, take precious care of your own heart as best as you can. Luckily, following your instincts won't likely steer you wrong today if you don't waste energy worrying about something you can't control. Roll with each event as it comes by responding from your gut and not your head. Heavenly intervention isn't necessary when you realize that the Divine exists within."
sagittarius,2015-11-01,"You might experience a big disappointment today if you are seeking a logical reason for everything that happens to you. Unfortunately, quick explanations are not forthcoming now, turning up the volume on your frustrations. Thankfully, you can consciously shift your attention from your current discontent toward exciting possibilities in the future with a simple attitude adjustment. Putting the present moment in a wider perspective inspires you to cross over to the sunny side of the street. Smile and the world smiles with you."
capricorn,2015-11-01,"It seems as if the rug is pulled out from beneath your feet today if your partner withdraws just as you're ready to engage in a romantic dance. The emotional Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Relationships kindles the flames of passion, especially if you already have your eye on someone special. But your sense of urgency bends your energy out of shape. Play it cool instead of overcompensating by demanding more attention now. Surprisingly, your natural self-sufficiency acts as a magnet to pull others in."
aquarius,2015-11-01,"The odds are against you making it through the entire day without encountering a relationship drama. Spontaneously jumping in to help a friend handle an emotional crisis might be unavoidable since you can't ignore someone else's cry for help. Although it's admirable to support those you love, just be careful that your own agenda is not completely lost in the process. In the bigger picture, chores can wait until another day; showing up for those in need is what matters most."
pisces,2015-11-01,"You wake up anticipating a day of fun, but you can't just run off and amuse yourself now until you have met your obligations. Family members may even apply peer pressure to keep you on the straight and narrow path. Don't give up on the idea of partaking in pleasurable activities today because you might be able to sneak out for a well-deserved break -- as long as you return to finish your responsibilities with replenished vitality. Whistle while you work and others can't help but join in."
aries,2015-11-02,"You're less inclined to hide your feelings today, even if you think that what you say could make others rather uncomfortable. You're not particularly interested in stirring up any conflict now, yet you won't likely let a battle of wills stop your revelation. Share what you must, but think twice before you just blurt out something that you later wish you didn't. Sometimes your first thought is not your best one when it comes to matters of the heart. Bite your tongue before you hurt someone you love."
taurus,2015-11-02,"You want your actions to speak louder than your words so that others can see your good intentions at work. A creative Venus-Mars conjunction in your 5th House of Self-Expression pushes you to do more and talk less. But your motives might be misunderstood unless you also inform everyone of your agenda. Unfortunately, assuming that someone else will accurately interpret your behavior could land you in hot water. Act proactively; avert an unnecessary crisis by taking the extra step and explaining your plans first."
gemini,2015-11-02,"You may be swept up in an emotional current that weaves together several separate threads of your life. Fortunately, there isn't much that you need to do to prepare since the integration could come rather naturally now. The one obstacle that could block your way is your desire to logically understand each of your choices. Rational mastery is a dead-end street today; it's time to simply go with the flow of your feelings and trust your heart to lead you in the right direction."
cancer,2015-11-02,"There's a lot of turmoil simmering beneath the surface today, even though you might appear to put up a good front when you think anyone is looking. However, if you don't let others know what you need, you can't blame them if you don't get what you want. You can inadvertently increase your dissatisfaction by keeping your feelings quiet or you can make the most of the fiery Leo Moon's energy and share your heart's desires. Speak now or forever hold your peace."
leo,2015-11-02,"Distractions pop up so quickly today that it's crucial to maintain your focus. It's best to handle each situation as it occurs rather than letting your feelings accumulate, even if you're pulled one way and then another. You are tempted to give a blow-by-blow description of your changing moods now that the emotive Moon is hanging out in your sign. But sharing too much information is counterproductive when you have so much important work to do. Filtering out the noise helps you deliver a message others are willing to support."
virgo,2015-11-02,"If you are still waiting for the perfect moment to declare what's on your mind, weigh the alternatives one last time and then speak your piece today. Although roaring like a lion isn't necessarily your style, shining the light on your accomplishments now is a strategic thing to do. Keep in mind that people won't think any less of you if you finally stand up and accept the recognition that you deserve. There's nothing wrong with taking pride in your work, especially when it inspires you to manifest your highest potential."
libra,2015-11-02,"You might not be very clear about your destination now, but you're still eagerly anticipating what's next. Mental Mercury slips out of your sign today, shifting your perspective and encouraging you to invent new ways to express your creativity. Nevertheless, don't begin your new venture in stealth mode. Take this cosmic opportunity to discuss your tentative plans without hesitation. Putting your options into words will help you decide on the best course of action. Thankfully, sharing your inspiration with others gives you just the boost of confidence you need to reach for the stars."
scorpio,2015-11-02,"Your powerful emotions could leave you feeling awkward today if there's no place to express them in your social interactions. The passion conjured up by the sexy Venus-Mars conjunction may be difficult to explain, especially with the presence of mischievous Mercury in your sign. Although you Scorpions were built to withstand pressure, your friends might be uncomfortable with your disclosure. Nevertheless, it's not your job to sweep things under the rug. If honesty is  the best policy, than remaining true to your heart is the kindest thing you can do for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2015-11-02,"You can't restrain the tide of desire that is welling up inside you, but you still might feel like it's not possible to tell others what you want. You may try to suppress your emotions because the thought of discussing them makes you anxious. But acting like nothing is wrong isn't a path to happiness, either. Even if you think your feelings will only get in the way of an otherwise uncomplicated day, rest assured that saying what's on your mind is better than remaining silent. The amount of relief alone is worth pushing past your fears. If you can't be authentic with your friends, then it's time to make some new ones."
capricorn,2015-11-02,"Although you can't escape your commitments, you might also crave some well-deserved downtime. Fortunately, you can get away with doing a little less at work now, but your desire to impress others with your competence doesn't leave a lot of room for relaxation. However, there's no need to be so hard on yourself for you probably have much higher expectations than anyone else. Taking a break today allows you to shine even brighter tomorrow."
aquarius,2015-11-02,"Love could be in the air today, yet it's up to you to make the magic happen. Luckily, you can express your feelings in a deeply personal manner, even if the  tantalizing Venus-Mars conjunction doesn't have you buzzing with romantic energy. You may be extremely serious about accomplishing your goals, but you still prefer to collaborate with a playful partner now. Strike up a conversation with someone who can make you laugh while still adding meaning to your already impressive body of work. A connection of the heart inspires your creative process."
pisces,2015-11-02,"Finalizing your itinerary for an upcoming trip might make practical sense today, but you could miss a chance to strengthen a relationship bond unless you set priorities and stick to them. It's not that you lack follow-through; it's just you could be easily distracted by a future goal that pulls you away from an emotional connection in the present moment. Don't be overly judgmental of yourself or anyone else. Just keep bringing your thoughts back to the power of now and eventually you'll return to what is most important to your heart."
aries,2015-11-03,"All eyes are on you today because you can imagine the most amazing possibilities where everyone else only sees problems. Others flock to your positivity since they believe in your solutions and admire your confidence. Nevertheless, you can end up disappointing those you want to impress if your plans ignore the hard cold facts. Separating your dreams from reality will require a high level of concentration, but the results will turn you into a hero. Taking a risk is worthwhile as long as the odds are in your favor."
taurus,2015-11-03,"Your coworkers are more interested in playing around than being serious today and you don't want to waste precious time participating in their games. Although you have a lot of obligations on your plate now, thankfully, you possess enough common sense to save your strength for when you will need it. Nevertheless, spending some time laughing and joking with others could also be rejuvenating in a heartwarming kind of way. Work smarter, not harder so you can have your cake and eat it, too."
gemini,2015-11-03,"Don't panic about meeting everyone's expectations today, since you won't be able to reign in the energy of the lively Leo Moon as she drops by to make a scene in your 3rd House of Communication. Taking responsibility for your actions is one thing, but there are only so many variables one person can control. Although your day turns out to be on the spicy side, don't get too wild and crazy or you'll regret your behavior pretty quickly. Keep in mind that cleaning up an emotional mess won't be as much fun as making it."
cancer,2015-11-03,"You could easily spend more money today than you expect, especially if you're hosting a celebration of some sort. Naturally, you hope to make a good impression with the perfect setting and delicious refreshments, but others may be less concerned about the details than you are now. Extravagance can bring its own punishment if it leaves you short on cash or creates too much stress. Establishing a budget prevents you from overextending your resources; keep in mind that it's the company that matters most."
leo,2015-11-03,"You want to build a strategy for success around the practice of only stating the absolute truth. However, the Moon's presence in your expressive sign encourages you to share your motivational message even if there isn't an appreciative audience. It's admirable if you want to inspire others to seek enlightenment, but keep in mind that your idea of Nirvana is not the same for everyone else. Walking your talk creates the most positive impact today, setting an enviable example for everyone to follow."
virgo,2015-11-03,Your organizational skills may be needed to bail someone out and you are happy to ride to the rescue today. You typically don't mind working behind the scenes and you prefer total anonymity now with the Moon playing hide-and-seek in your 12th House of Secrets. You just want the quiet satisfaction of knowing that your sacrifice helped to save the day for your colleague. Think of this as a friendly reminder from the cosmos that you can accomplish nearly anything you put your mind to as long as your heart is in the right place.
libra,2015-11-03,"You're longing to show off to the world today, and social gatherings can become your temporary stage of choice. Although you want to be applauded for your efforts, it's still prudent to hold some energy in reserve. People may not know the whole story yet and it's advisable to keep it that way for a while longer. Avoid the temptation to bring everything out into the open now, for there's no hurry to set the record straight. Your performance leaves more to the imagination if you don't color in all the details."
scorpio,2015-11-03,"It's a no-brainer to do what is expected when the rules and the limits are well-defined. However, there are so many fuzzy boundaries today that everything could get sloppy before you know it. Don't wait until you have fallen over the edge to figure out where it is. Observe social protocols, for they can prevent you from landing in trouble. It's a perfect day to embark on a spiritual quest of some sort, but do yourself a favor now and don't make any major moves until your clarity returns."
sagittarius,2015-11-03,"You can't seem to find the voice of your own logic today, or maybe you just choose to ignore it. You have a rather straightforward decision to make: pursue a pleasurable experience or work hard while delaying the fun for another day. Naturally, no one is surprised if you are the first one at a party and the last one to leave. Self-indulgence most likely will win out, so you might as well kick up your heels while you can. But don't fool yourself; the work will still be waiting for you tomorrow."
capricorn,2015-11-03,"You have your heart set on something special and you won't let anyone deter you from your current destination. Perhaps you've been dreaming of a night out on the town or a weekend getaway, only to run into logistical problems today. Unfortunately, you might not be able to power your way through the changing circumstances. Be proactive and scale back your plans so reality doesn't need to do it for you. Luckily, you can still find plenty of satisfaction now in a smaller version of your original dream."
aquarius,2015-11-03,"You may feel lucky to have such a loyal partner or playmate in your life, yet for some reason today it's tricky to hold up your end of the deal. Instead of being attached to someone at the hip, you long for more personal freedom to move creatively on your own. However, if you can show a little self-restraint in your choices now, you might be able to find a way to balance your opposing needs and make everyone happy, including yourself. Relationships thrive when you master the art of compromise."
pisces,2015-11-03,"You might start the day with the intention to be serious-minded about your business, but you soon realize that having fun amplifies your creative expression. However, you may have to stand up to a naysayer who tries to restrict your freedom today. Obviously, you plan on honoring your promises but it's not your job to drop everything and put on a performance just to placate someone else. You can still fulfill your commitments tomorrow after you sow your wild oats today."
aries,2015-11-04,"Searching for hidden information may be a compulsion, as if you don't really have a choice today. Something at work isn't quite right and you won't be comfortable until you get to the bottom of the mystery; even running into a dead end won't stop your investigation now. However, digging too insistently will lead to headaches and frustration. Adopting a gentle but persistent strategy will very likely pay off when you uncover the right clues. Put on your detective hat and let your curiosity lead the way."
taurus,2015-11-04,"You believe the only way you will get anywhere now is to set an attainable goal and relentlessly pursue it, no matter what anyone else says. However, your current unwillingness to relinquish control might actually be a deterrent to your satisfaction. Instead of going on the defense when someone tries to show you a different path to your destination, carefully consider all the advice you receive today before you head off in the wrong direction. You never know what breakthrough is waiting for you unless you're willing to confront your fears and face the truth."
gemini,2015-11-04,"You are confident that you're on the right track and you're not interested in stepping outside of your comfort zone today. You're quite capable of holding your ground, even if a powerful adversary applies undue pressure. Making your position clear from the start is a wise strategy, but don't waste words in endless debate. You can always explain your intentions more fully after the drama dissipates. Honestly, you're the only one who really knows the wishes of your heart."
cancer,2015-11-04,"A casual interaction might trigger unexpressed feelings, possibly bringing a dormant resentment back into awareness now. Your response to someone else may be swift and harsh as logical Mercury receives a reality check from stern Saturn. Tread carefully today or you could inadvertently hurt someone as you express your heartfelt anger passionately, but at the wrong target. Processing your emotions in private gives you a perfect chance to forgive and move on. Taking the high road is the fastest route to healing your heart."
leo,2015-11-04,"You might surprise someone with a preemptive strike today if you think there is a serious threat to your financial stability. Although you may be anxious to confront a powerful person, be absolutely sure it's necessary before you start something that morphs into a prolonged battle of wills. Keep in mind that winning an argument is not as crucial now as getting your point across. Moderating your tone and softening your stance can deescalate the tension. Resolution is more likely when your final objective is the truth."
virgo,2015-11-04,"Your sharp words could cut like a sword today, even if that's not your intention. Your delivery drips with sarcasm and your heightened passion might diminish your objectivity. It's critical to remain as transparent as possible in all that you say now. However, balancing your unrestrained honesty with a healthy dose of compassion is the kindest way to create positive change. Make an effort to cultivate an atmosphere of cooperation; simply put, you can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
libra,2015-11-04,"You may think that you are being extremely rational in your approach now, but cerebral Mercury has left your fair-minded sign for more tumultuous waters. However, someone else's erratic energy might be spilling over into your life. Nevertheless, an emotional outburst won't solve anything, and could even leave you feeling exhausted. Fortunately, you can turn things around by simply allowing others the space to follow their own dreams whether you understand them or not. Live and let live; relaxing your judgement has the potential to change your relationships for the better."
scorpio,2015-11-04,You feel the need to express your position in no uncertain terms as communicator Mercury highlights your passionate sign. But you might not be sure about what information to share and which details to keep to yourself. You can become rather broody and obsessive as you try to sort out how much to reveal today. But the truth is there are many ways to establish your boundaries so just choose the ones that work for you now. It's essential to get your ideas out in the open even if you don't have all of the answers.
sagittarius,2015-11-04,"You've made up your mind about a career decision now, yet your blind confidence can turn into rigid self-righteousness if you ignore the feedback from others. Unfortunately, your denial could become a problem professionally if your boss isn't pleased with your close-minded attitude. It's pointless to think that you will change the dynamics of a situation by rationalizing your actions. Go ahead and build your case today, but avoid provoking unnecessary trouble until the current intensity passes. Taking the path of least resistance offers you respite from the storm."
capricorn,2015-11-04,"Finding the origins of your stress is challenging today, but an unspoken truth could resurface over and over again in a series of minor disagreements. However, you might actually be arguing about something that's completely irrelevant while the real issue lurks just on the outskirts of your awareness. Take a deep breath and save your opinions until after you've had time to calm down. In the meantime, strive to understand another person's perspective instead of only selling your own. Taking a walk in someone else's shoes is the best way to find a solution that fits for all involved."
aquarius,2015-11-04,"Relationship dynamics have been weighing on your mind lately and they won't stop bothering you until you tackle the problem directly. Unfortunately, you might not even realize where the tension is coming from, making it more difficult to resolve the situation. But don't shift the blame onto anyone else; instead, take full responsibility for your feelings and communicate your point of view the best you can today before moving on. Clearing the air enables everyone to hear the truth whether they like it or not."
pisces,2015-11-04,"Your workmates may not be very supportive today as they take you to task on an issue that you thought was fairly straightforward. This disagreement creates additional anxiety because you aren't sure you can trust your logical analysis, even if others are demanding that you do what makes the most sense. If your heart continues to tell you something different, follow its message instead of the words inside your head. The late UN Secretary-General Dag Hammarskjold wrote, ""Never for the sake of peace and quiet deny your convictions."""
aries,2015-11-05,"No matter what you hope to do today, work-related tasks demand your undivided attention until the job is complete. This ambitious commitment may sound like bad news, but doing your chores could turn out to be a pleasant experience if you don't put up a fight. Keep your eye on the final goal, regardless of whatever delightful distractions pop up. Just think of it as an endurance test from the universe. If you stay focused on the finish line, you'll cross it with flying colors. Rewards are sweeter when you sweat for them."
taurus,2015-11-05,"Whatever concerns surface today may not be as daunting as they seem at first. Ultimately, the current pressure is not great enough to prompt a significant life change, but you still might have to jump through a few hoops to move things along. Thankfully, once you get the ball rolling, progress becomes easier as the day wears on. Surprisingly, you could even have time for a playful diversion. Keep your productivity on target by avoiding extreme reactions. Balancing your energy maximizes your potential."
gemini,2015-11-05,"Even if your thoughts are running amok now, this is a perfect chance to set clear priorities and consciously focus on what's most important. Your emotions may be entangled with those of close family members, but something unexpected could pull you away from your plans at home today. Although responsibilities are calling from all directions, you can still reconnect with the ones you love later on in the evening. There's nothing wrong with admitting that home is where your heart is happiest."
cancer,2015-11-05,"There is so much going on at work that it is nearly impossible to reestablish balance to your daily routine. Fortunately, you can feel a subtle but significant shift in the energy today. Even if you don't yet fully understand where the current trajectory is heading, at least recognize that you can't tie yourself to the status quo any longer. Don't be too calculating as you plan your future or you'll end up outsmarting yourself. Follow the flow; your life is changing and you need to change with it."
leo,2015-11-05,"You might be worrying about your long-term financial condition for not-so-obvious reasons. Although your mind is on your money today, chances are that your current anxiety is a reflection of a deeper concern you are harboring about your life goals. Thankfully, a little self-examination will set the record straight.  What do you consider valuable? Where do you see yourself in five years? What's on your bucket list? The more you envision the future now, the more you realize how much work there is to do in the present moment."
virgo,2015-11-05,Relationships are the source of confusion today if you impulsively act on your feelings. You might be suddenly confronted with the fact that everyone doesn't necessarily share the same level of interest as you. Don't push for resolution to prove a point; solutions may remain elusive for a while longer. Take as much time as you need to listen to the whispers of your heart and decipher the clues in your dreams. Don't grow complacent; be ready to run with your answer when you find it.
libra,2015-11-05,"Turning your brilliant ideas into action is tricky now, but it's not because anyone wants to see you fail. Instead, it's your own indecisiveness that stymies your progress. Although you may have ongoing issues about making timely decisions, this is one choice you're actually better off postponing today because you don't have the objective perspective you need. Give it a few days and then make up your mind. It might look like procrastination to the rest of the world, but you know it's all about strategic timing."
scorpio,2015-11-05,"Fight the impulse to be overly vague when you ask for what you need today. Even if the stars don't grant your every wish, you can still end up closer to getting what you want. Exploring the possibility that you're missing something crucial to the big picture inspires you to dig deeper. Look within and you can transform uncertainty into specificity but you won't find your answers immediately. In the meantime, your willingness to be truly authentic with those you love is appreciated more than you know."
sagittarius,2015-11-05,"Your naturally cheerful disposition normally opens doors for you, but your exuberance could work against you today. It's unrealistic to expect others to take you seriously when you're busy breaking out the party favors and cracking  jokes. It's wonderful to play the master of ceremonies whenever possible, but now you can't leave the practical matters behind until they are fully addressed. Surprise everyone with your willingness to work hard, and then dazzle them with your brilliance."
capricorn,2015-11-05,"Your attention to detail is admirable today, but you could grow so obsessed with gathering more facts that you lose track of your original goal. You might believe that possessing the right piece of information now can empower you to overcome nearly any obstacle. However, you may be sorely disappointed if you become so fascinated with the pixels that you no longer see the big picture. Change your perspective by taking a few steps back and then boldly recreate your vision of the future from your new vantage point."
aquarius,2015-11-05,"Although everything might seem a little off center today, you remain hopeful that the tension will dissipate on its own. There's not quite enough conflict for you to initiate any major changes in your life now. But there is just the right amount of free-floating anxiety to encourage you to assume a self-protective posture. Don't let down your guard or you could court disaster. Thankfully, your clever ability of staying one step ahead of everyone else will surely pay off in the days ahead."
pisces,2015-11-05,"Struggling with the fine distinctions between fact and fiction takes up most of your energy today. Even with your natural proclivity toward fantasy, you can usually tell what's real when push comes to shove. However, it's nearly impossible to know what to trust now. Dream big while delaying major decisions for a few more days. Although your judgment may be temporarily  clouded, your imagination is more vivid than ever. Keep dipping into the deep waters since that's where the buried treasure is hidden."
aries,2015-11-06,"There's little chance of you being very logical today as the cosmos lures you deep into Fantasyland. Common sense is difficult to find, but you could play this to your advantage if you stop trying to make practical decisions. Even if you must report to work, you can still find time to drift off and contemplate spiritual mysteries. Slipping back and forth between parallel universes is easy now if you don't give a play-by-play commentary of your wanderings. Talk less, dream more."
taurus,2015-11-06,"Although unresolved issues may linger in the air, it's tempting to convince yourself that everything is copacetic in a relationship. Even if you probably realize a serious conversation is in order today, you still prefer to avoid the facts so you don't have to deal with the emotional fallout. It's a gift to see potential in others that's not yet manifested, but it's unwise to substitute your hopes and dreams for reality. Take care of the business right in front of your nose before it's too late."
gemini,2015-11-06,"Intense emotions spring forth from your subconscious today, but they might make you so uncomfortable that you bury them as fast as they show up. Although you seek less complexity in your life these days, your desires are rather complicated now. Your intentions may still be misunderstood even if you believe you're being  completely transparent. Don't assume others know what you need. Confirm that your message has been accurately received and then patiently wait for the other shoe to drop."
cancer,2015-11-06,"You can share your feelings in an imaginative manner today, but might struggle getting your point across as a blurry Mercury-Neptune trine muddles your words. Your daydreams may be deliciously sweet as long as you don't assume they are practical enough to pursue. Wait until your clarity returns tomorrow before attempting to express something that has lasting significance. In the meantime, channel your passion into a creative endeavor since your best work comes from the heart."
leo,2015-11-06,"Staying home and losing yourself in a project might sound enticing today, but more practical concerns demand your attention. Nevertheless, you're still likely to spend time envisioning everything else you wish you were doing now. Unfortunately, fun and games may need to wait for the weekend with strict Saturn running the show in your 5th House of Play. Rather than fretting about missing out on the action, be thankful for what you can actually accomplish if you put your mind to it."
virgo,2015-11-06,"You're immersed in an idyllic multi-colored bubble today. But it's tricky to bring a fantasy into reality while irrational Neptune dances with cerebral Mercury. Regretfully, you may realize your daily life is overflowing with pressing responsibilities once you open your eyes. Although you're tempted to wander aimlessly in imaginary realms now, it's unwise to avoid your current obligations. Bringing your attention back to the real world can make a positive difference when you need it most."
libra,2015-11-06,"Relinquishing your preconceived notions about what the day holds in store for you is a simple test of your willpower today. However, it's crucial to your future success to move beyond your fantasies and finish your chores. Reality is elusive as a four-leaf clover now because logical Mercury has difficulty working under the influence of dreamy Neptune. Let the most important decisions slide until tomorrow. Once the fog clears you will be more capable of choosing your battles wisely. Fighting the inevitable is pointless; roll up your sleeves and get to work."
scorpio,2015-11-06,"You realize it's important to wrap up old business now, but you prefer the idea of pursuing pleasure while mental Mercury connects with starry-eyed Neptune in your 5th House of Fun and Games. This never-ending conflict between work and play might be especially aggravating today, so seek out activities that soothe your nerves and encourage your creativity. You can always catch up on your work after the weekend when you have a fresh perspective. Take a magic carpet ride to another dimension and explore to your heart's content."
sagittarius,2015-11-06,"You might feel as if you're trapped in a rut today, motivating you to take a risk in order to shake things up at work. Unfortunately, changing your routine without a solid strategy could be more upsetting than exciting now. Use your imagination to picture the ideal outcome and then create an ambitious plan to manifest your vision as you see it in your mind's eye. Don't try to do a complete makeover in one day; success is more likely if you let your ideas mature before coloring in all the details."
capricorn,2015-11-06,"Fulfilling your obligations is your top priority, but you could be easily pulled off course by your friends or coworkers today. Their big ideas sound extremely enticing, but grandiose plans are not likely grounded in reality. Don't believe everything you're told now; if something seems too good to be true, it probably is. Nevertheless, it doesn't hurt to dream as long as you wait a few days before investing your reputation in the future. In the end, you won't be happy unless you build your foundation on solid ground."
aquarius,2015-11-06,"You don't like feeling disoriented, yet today's ethereal Mercury-Neptune trine could prompt you to waste time trying to reestablish your bearings. Unfortunately, stability is elusive now, but this cosmic uncertainty is beneficial if you use it to question your assumptions about your career goals. There's no need to make any life-changing choices yet; answers will appear as early as tomorrow. In the meantime, the gold at the rainbow's end is yours to dream about."
pisces,2015-11-06,"Your fantasies seem real enough to touch while surreal Neptune in psychic Pisces aligns with mischievous Mercury. But your ideas only appear plausible until you actually attempt to make them tangible. Although it's wise to listen to your intuition, it's also critical to rely on facts when you're trying to create your ideal future. Give yourself temporary permission to meander through your imagination without any pressure now. Paradoxically, floating in the symbolic realms today leads to more rational planning tomorrow."
aries,2015-11-07,"Although you may have the best of intentions today, it's tough to finish all your chores because interruptions continue to catch you off guard. However, there are only so many hours in the day and you can't waste time on trivial pursuits. Grab every opportunity that allows you to cross off another item on your to-do list. Ultimately, wisely managing each moment as it occurs is more productive now than trying to make up for lost time."
taurus,2015-11-07,"It takes a lot to pull you off task once you gather your momentum, so you should be able to complete nearly any project you start today. There's no need to be overly concerned about working quickly now; just establish your own pace and stick to it. If you do the job correctly from the beginning, you will arrive at your destination on time. It doesn't matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop."
gemini,2015-11-07,"Although you take your rest and relaxation quite seriously today, you may not be very quiet with your opinions. You could be feeling like your regular talkative self, even if you're more preoccupied with substantial issues now than you are with clever conversation. There's a good chance that someone expects you to be the source of entertainment at a party, but it is your prerogative to acknowledge that life is not always fun and games. It's more important to be true to yourself than to humor anyone else."
cancer,2015-11-07,"Your schedule may be so unforgiving today that you can't easily alter your previously made plans. In fact, you can exhaust yourself by resisting the prevailing currents. Instead, stick to your agenda now and honor your existing commitments the best you can. Don't harbor any resentment, even if you wish you could do something entirely different. The day is more pleasant for everyone if you maintain a positive attitude along with a healthy respect for your obligations. As Elbert Hubbard wrote, ""Responsibility is the price of freedom."""
leo,2015-11-07,"Your generosity of spirit motivates you to make promises that are difficult to keep. However, you don't mind falling short of your initial goals if you have a good reason to accomplish less. You might even turn down your intensity for a while today because you believe a little self-restraint will empower you to shine your light longer. If others lean on you now, it's because they can sense that you're dependable. Nevertheless, don't create unnecessary stress by trying to live up to someone else's expectations; doing the best you can is all that anyone can ask."
virgo,2015-11-07,"You are committed to a certain standard of excellence today, yet you can be extremely productive without appearing to work hard today. Paradoxically, it may seem like you're having more fun than you really are now, since you're busy hiding your insecurities. However, you secretly worry that your finished product won't be good enough. Thankfully, you are a more critical judge than most of your peers. Your desire for perfection is a gift if you know when to turn it on and when to turn it off."
libra,2015-11-07,"Treating others kindly makes your heart happy, especially now that the Moon is hanging out in your socially-oriented sign. But the Moon's alignment with hardworking Saturn can stir up issues of resentment this evening because you wish that someone else would take care of you for a change. Although you might hit an emotional rough patch, your top priority is to keep the peace. Cultivating harmony today sets your dreams up for fruition in the near future."
scorpio,2015-11-07,"You aren't satisfied playing the role of an invisible helper today and could even have a minor meltdown in front of everyone. Although the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Secrets emphasizes your behind-the-scenes role, you also require a chunk of time to explore your own emotional needs. Don't delay taking care of yourself now, even if you're worried about appearing selfish. If you don't look after your own heart, you won't be strong enough to look after anyone else's."
sagittarius,2015-11-07,"You have a variety of tasks to handle today and strategic planning can help you accomplish what's on your agenda. Normally, you might have a tough time turning down an invitation to a social function, but you're able to act with considerable restraint now. It's not that you want to miss out on the fun; it's just a matter of priorities and you have more serious thoughts on your mind. Your sense of maturity is admirable but it's not necessary to ignore your friends in order to demonstrate your responsible side."
capricorn,2015-11-07,You want everyone to see you in a good light today and you might go out of your way to impress those closest to you. But the Moon's passage through your 10th House of Public Status can rain on your parade by squelching your creativity. Don't bother wasting time trying to force spontaneity now; initiating one carefully considered action is much smarter than behaving recklessly. Self-discipline is your strong suit and it currently pays off in spades if you put it to good use.
aquarius,2015-11-07,"You are caught between needing an exciting night on the town and isolating yourself from the world by hiding out at home. However, neither extreme is possible if there are commitments already on your calendar. Your friends might not even sense your dissatisfaction now because you are masterful at camouflaging your feelings behind a veneer of busyness. You will be happier in the long run if you come clean and share your unfulfilled desires with someone you trust. A healthy dose of honesty is good for everyone involved."
pisces,2015-11-07,"Your responsibilities grow in complexity today and it's no longer sufficient to simply fulfill your promises. Relationship dynamics have changed as your awareness has grown. You must integrate your recent spiritual lessons into your everyday life now. It's not enough to write about your experiences like kids report on their summer vacations when going back to school. Instead, recapture the intensity of your awakening by taking your new perspective to heart."
aries,2015-11-08,"You are extremely appreciative of an old friend who continues to stand by you through thick and thin. You are inclined to tell others how you feel today, but you could be so insistent about expressing your emotions that your sentiment sounds forced. Your attempt at self-disclosure doesn't have to be an elaborate performance; a simple statement of your gratitude is worth so much more than empty praise that rambles on and on. A true heart connection defies explanation, but a warm hug wraps it up nicely."
taurus,2015-11-08,"It's all too easy to be distracted by your own larger-than-life ideas during these chaotic times. Although you strive to find peace of mind today, you still may overdo an activity that makes you feel good in the present moment. Thankfully, you are not a big fan of knee-jerk reactions or taking major chances. However, current circumstances continue to remind you that all actions have consequences. There's no harm in a little reckless abandon, but practicing moderation is your key to happiness now."
gemini,2015-11-08,"You might be more self-assured these days, but your overconfidence at the wrong time can land you in a heap of trouble. You don't have to be so eager to please just because you want to show off your big heart. Instead of setting up a situation that requires too much of your time and effort, limit your involvement today before you're in over your head. It makes more sense to maintain autonomy now than to untangle yourself from an emotional drama later on."
cancer,2015-11-08,"You don't like it when people disagree for no apparent reason. Acting as a peacemaker is one path to smoothing over ruffled feathers, but resolution may seem easier than it actually is. You could have the very best of intentions today, but someone might misconstrue your actions and think you're trying to control them. Rather than changing anyone else's behavior, shift your own attitude instead. Let people know how you feel and then back away to give them time to process their reactions in peace."
leo,2015-11-08,"Too many things to consider in the active pursuit of a relationship prevent you from making up your mind today. You really don't want anyone else to perceive you as being wishy-washy, so it's easier to withdraw than to try and explain your ambiguity. Ironically, if you share your current dilemma now, your friends might push you to hurry up and decide. Take your time and don't say anything until you arrive at your own conclusions. There's no timetable when it comes to matters of the heart."
virgo,2015-11-08,"Although you attempt to limit your activities today, you could be enticed into participating in someone else's agenda. You might ignore another person's idea at first, but as the plan begins to sound better, you become more tempted to jump on board. Even if you resonate with an innovative concept now, it still may be smarter to say no to another obligation. Focus on your priorities until you have more free time to help out others without compromising your own goals."
libra,2015-11-08,"You may be unnervingly quiet today, but others can still appreciate what you have to offer now that the reflective Moon is shining in your peaceful sign. Everyone seems to naturally understand that your strengths are reinforced by a spiritual belief that you can't put into words. Thankfully, you don't have to say much at all; your integrity is apparent when your actions are aligned with your heart."
scorpio,2015-11-08,"You're a champion at connecting with life's subtle mysteries and you're willing to dig as deep as necessary now to uncover the answers. The Moon's current visit to your 12th House of Privacy could have you slipping back into your past to find the inspiration you need to handle current events. Nevertheless, your realizations may be so entangled with memories that you cannot easily explain them to anyone else. The good news is there's no pressure to share your discoveries until you're good and ready."
sagittarius,2015-11-08,"Preaching about moderation is one thing, but following through with sensible behavior can be a real challenge now. You are familiar with the concept of emotional detachment, but your feelings are dragging you all over the map today. You might be willing to risk your social stability in order to shift a relationship dynamic in your favor. But seeing interpersonal interactions as a competition is counterproductive to your personal growth. Cooperation is essential when it comes to the game of love."
capricorn,2015-11-08,"Staying on task is easier when waves of optimism give you new hope. However, the notion of getting something for nothing isn't very appealing to you industrious Goats, motivating you to work for what you want. Fortunately, this ambitious strategy will likely bring you the rewards you seek as long as you singularly focus on your goals. The fastest way to reach your destination is to continue steadily on your path without taking any impulsive shortcuts. Aim at a distant star and keep it in sight until success is within your grasp."
aquarius,2015-11-08,"This may be a day of reckoning if your resources are overextended. Unfortunately, you might have reached too far by spending too much energy on a project or buying an expensive item that you didn't even need in the first place. Recent actions are recycled and catch up with you now as you struggle to regain firm footing. Even if you don't immediately see positive results from your efforts to reestablish control, rest assured that your good intentions will eventually have the stabilizing effect you desire."
pisces,2015-11-08,"You're tempted to behave in an overly demanding manner today because you may believe that you deserve more recognition from those you love. Unfortunately, the squeaky wheel doesn't always get the grease first; you could receive a greater reward by practicing patience, instead. You can be quietly aware of your needs without shouting them from the rooftop. Satisfaction is sweeter when others acknowledge you on their own accord."
aries,2015-11-09,"You're quite thankful for coworkers who support you even when you're acting like a pain in the neck. Nevertheless, others still demand a lot from you today and they will give you their opinions, whether you ask for them or not. You are confident that you are doing the right thing now and don't want anyone to question your motives. However, remaining open to constructive feedback ultimately helps you achieve better results in nearly anything you do. Success can be yours if you keep your ego in check."
taurus,2015-11-09,"Although there's a lot of work in front of you today, you still might find it difficult to shift into gear. Part of your problem stems from your lackadaisical attitude now; you assume you can accomplish all your chores because you tend to underestimate the time tasks will take and overestimate your capacity for speed. Ask someone you trust to help you correctly gauge the size of a job before saying yes. A little realism from the start prevents you from finding yourself in over your head tomorrow."
gemini,2015-11-09,"Your laissez-faire management style works wonders today as long as your coworkers agree with your strategy. However, they might not tell you if they have issues with your plans, and their reluctance to communicate can be problematic. You may go along believing that everyone is on board and supporting your ideas, only to later discover that your ship has been abandoned. Avoid a mutiny by checking in with each person on an individual basis to make sure every voice is heard. Taking a proactive approach saves the day."
cancer,2015-11-09,"You might not realize there are conflicts brewing on the home front today, until a difference of opinion erupts into a minor crisis. Paying attention to the minute details enables you to see past your dreams of perfection. But instead of avoiding unpleasant feelings, keep in mind that you're not the only participant in this unsettling situation. Everyone has a particular part to play in the drama so make sure each individual gets a turn in the spotlight."
leo,2015-11-09,"The weekend is over, yet you might be resistant to the workload on your desk. Instead of following the rules, you're searching for ways to extend your playtime. Maybe you are burning the candle at both ends and realize you deserve a well-earned break from the grind now. Luckily, an unplanned activity could be the source of great fun. Just remember, you can relax with a guilt-free conscience if you clear the responsibilities from your path first."
virgo,2015-11-09,"You can be overly generous in your encouragement of your associates today, making you a lousy negotiator for your own agenda. You might even be tempted to offer assistance that's beyond your capability. It's all too easy now to forget that some decisions about money should not be made with your heart. Just because you admire a particular person doesn't mean you should pay more than a service or product is worth. Keep your wallet in your pocket until your logic returns."
libra,2015-11-09,"Even if you are feeling unmotivated, you start to emerge from your easygoing attitude now. You're more opinionated and may overreact to what you hear today. Nevertheless, don't be afraid of saying what's on your mind. Your perceptions are keen and you would be smart to trust your impulses as long as you remember to be kind in your delivery. Honor your own feelings as much as you respect everyone else's."
scorpio,2015-11-09,"You may feel external pressure to tie up loose ends early in the day, and this cosmic message makes good sense. But you won't likely want to work very hard while the moody Moon is camped out in your 12th House of Escapism. You would be better off spending a bit of quiet time alone, taking a nature walk during lunch or cultivating a spiritual connection with someone special. Even if it's challenging to process your emotions now, it's easier to experience them when you're not in a crowd."
sagittarius,2015-11-09,"Your social inclinations are luring you to reach out beyond your personal network today, but you might have trouble deciding on a course of action. You want to be available for a spontaneous invitation now, making it difficult to commit to any one event. Thankfully, you possess the uncanny ability to turn a casual interaction with an acquaintance into an exciting encounter. Luckily, the fun seems to follow you wherever you go."
capricorn,2015-11-09,"You are chosen to play the role of a highly skilled diplomat today because everyone knows you can see both sides of a complex issue. Additionally, you bring analytical tools to the table, empowering you to take what you know and shape it into a convincing argument. Don't fall into the trap of picking sides now; instead, help all those involved reach common ground. Your objective outlook is a powerful catalyst for positive change."
aquarius,2015-11-09,"Keeping your attention on the here and now could be tricky business when your thoughts are being pulled to a distant horizon. Your futuristic thinking enhances your visionary skills, but it may not have anything to do with the chores you need to accomplish today. Nevertheless, if you have been dreaming about taking a short vacation, get out your calendar and mark the dates. Just remain on high alert so you can return to the present moment when reality calls."
pisces,2015-11-09,"A lighthearted interaction can feel quite intense while the Moon is stirring up trouble in your 8th House of Intimacy. You can't help but wonder about the changing dynamics because everyone seems more formidable now. But there's no reason to let anyone else's demands overwhelm you. Ultimately, delivering the goods is not as critical as you think today. Let your integrity and intention act as the windows to your heart."
aries,2015-11-10,"You're itching to make an escape today because you believe you could lose your chance if you don't act immediately. Unfortunately, you might climb too far out on a limb if you don't stop to think about where you're going. This isn't the best time to test your limits, even if you're sure you can't go wrong. Demonstrate your wisdom by heeding the cosmic signs; gathering experience now is a more reliable path to success than acting on false confidence."
taurus,2015-11-10,"Someone's feelings might appear inflated today and you're not sure how to react without creating more drama. Paradoxically, the issues seem to be more cosmic and less about your personal dynamics. It may even feel as if fate is playing a significant role in the events that are unfolding around you. However, there's no need to worry about loss of control. You are in good hands with joyful Jupiter leading the parade. Follow the energy wherever it goes while letting compassion be your guide."
gemini,2015-11-10,"A complicated issue with a family member continues to require your attention, but this personal matter becomes easier to manage now, even with your busy work schedule. Although your nerves are still on edge, the stress is finally beginning to settle down. The biggest problem is your heightened emotional reactivity. Try something as simple as counting to ten before responding to anyone else's demands. This will give you sufficient time to consider your feelings before saying anything you might regret."
cancer,2015-11-10,"You're uncharacteristically driven to step outside of your normal safety zone today. Staying at home is not a viable option now. Even if you feel blissfully content in your relationships, you have much to gain by exploring new ways of expressing your love. You don't have to take a big risk to reach out a little further than you did in the past. You may be happily surprised with the encouraging response you receive when you simply act from your heart."
leo,2015-11-10,"Your world would run smooth like a clock if only you could catch up and synchronize your internal rhythm to it. It's not like you can alter the world; you must change your inner dynamics. Like Cinderella, you can transform a disappointing set of circumstances into a magical experience by imagining life as you wish it to be. Thankfully, if you put your fantasies in order, there's a good chance they can become real. You are what you dream."
virgo,2015-11-10,"A most auspicious day could be in store for you as the radiant Sun forms a supportive sextile with lucky Jupiter in your sign. Instead of just gazing into your future, move toward the horizon of your choice. Don't let this cosmic opportunity slip by without positive action on your part. Even making a tiny adjustment to your direction today greatly improves your chances of reaching your destination tomorrow. He who hesitates is lost."
libra,2015-11-10,"Looking at your life through a spiritual filter today enables you to reframe a problem from a healthier perspective. Ironically, nothing much has changed on the outside, but your new and improved attitude can make all the difference in the world. You're tempted to share your optimistic outlook with others, but you might only dissipate your energy if you waste time justifying your beliefs. Instead, maximize the current potential by channeling your positive intentions into constructive actions."
scorpio,2015-11-10,"Follow your gut instincts today, especially if you're struck with a brilliant idea about doing a repetitive job in an entirely new way. Luckily, you're not restrained by your old patterns now, empowering you to analyze your work methods in a different light. Although your innovative plan might not produce tangible results, you won't ever know what could happen unless you give it a try. Even if you're not immediately successful, don't give up too soon; satisfaction may require multiple attempts before you get it just right."
sagittarius,2015-11-10,"Nothing will hold you back now if you can find the positive in every situation. However, you may be so confident that you forget to take the time to consider the consequences of your actions. Fortunately, your key planet Jupiter is your guardian angel today, blessing all decisions that impact your career path. Nevertheless, explore each of your options prior to committing to one path. A little bit of planning in the present moment amplifies the long-term positive impact of your current choices."
capricorn,2015-11-10,"Dreaming about the future is easier now than living in the present. You're not sure what to make of the stressful interpersonal dynamics at work. It may seem as if you're out of synch with your associates, but you don't know whether or not to confront the differences or let them pass. A flexible attitude can help to a point, but eventually you might need to say what's on your mind. Hold out as long as possible and then speak your peace. Practicing patience helps you clarify your position and improves the chances for a positive outcome."
aquarius,2015-11-10,"Oddly enough, you must tread carefully now because the stress level is so low. The extra concern is especially necessary if you fall into a comfort zone where you think everything should just land at your feet because you deserve it. Nevertheless, the golden ring is not going to arrive on its own accord; you must stretch your limits to reach for the prize. Don't settle for the easy way out; satisfaction must be earned with courage and hard work."
pisces,2015-11-10,"Your future looks so bright today you have to wear shades, since the resistance you recently faced is history. You might feel as if you spent too much time trying to overcome a single obstacle, but nothing will be gained now by walking down Memory Lane. It's more important to focus on collaborating with someone to accomplish your objectives. The potential to succeed is greater than usual if you follow up on a current opportunity before you lose the cosmic momentum."
aries,2015-11-11,"You can't help but raise issues that everyone else would rather avoid today. You're not looking to stir up trouble, but talking about a sensitive subject might prompt others to discredit you by criticizing your opinions. Although you don't want to waste energy defending your philosophy, it may be necessary in order to defuse the negativity before it takes hold. Thankfully, the perceptive Scorpio New Moon falls in your 8th House of Metamorphosis, inspiring you to see the conversation through to a successful conclusion."
taurus,2015-11-11,"Ignoring a friend or lover's incisive feedback is not a wise tactic while the Scorpio New Moon rattles your 7th House of Significant Others. You might not want to listen to what's being said, but taking a message to heart can be a significant catalyst for personal growth. There's no need to nod your head in agreement; however, seriously considering someone's less-than-pleasant assessment now is grist for your mill. No matter how useful the new information is to your transformation, you'll be a stronger person for going through the process."
gemini,2015-11-11,"Making simple modifications to your daily routine may be the smartest thing you can do today, as long as you choose ones that don't turn your life upside down. Fortunately, a subtle adjustment can set a series of profound consequences into motion when the Scorpio New Moon shakes up your 6th House of Self-Improvement. The potential for change is likely, so pick your direction wisely. Just remember that being too insistent could overwhelm others, causing your plans to backfire. Acting with gentle persistence is much more effective now than making one dramatic gesture."
cancer,2015-11-11,"You might believe your world has come to a standstill, but in truth it has not. To the contrary, you're right on the verge of something big. Perhaps you recently thought about starting a creative project or making a move on the romantic front. In either case, the evocative Scorpio New Moon returns to fire up your 5th House of Self-Expression, intensifying the emotional process. But nothing will happen overnight, so be patient. It's always darkest just before the dawn."
leo,2015-11-11,"Your feelings could be at odds with your actions today. You might choose to withhold your desires and just smile your way through the day, but you won't likely get away with it. Acknowledge your subjectivity while the passionate Scorpio New Moon spotlights your 4th House of Security. Thankfully, you can change the rules of the game; instead of choosing emotions or logic now, seek a position that honors both realms. Maintain a close connection with your heart while listening to the advice offered by your rational mind."
virgo,2015-11-11,"There may not be a better time to take initiative on an important project. Put your plans into action while the Scorpio New Moon energizes your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Use this creative lunar power to get your ideas out into the open, whether verbally or written. Nevertheless, it might be nearly impossible to follow through on everything you start today. Ride the planetary waves of change by relying on your sense of humor to keep everyone laughing, since the current intensity won't last very long."
libra,2015-11-11,"You're holding onto a very well-kept secret today, and this unexpressed juicy tidbit may have negative consequences. It's tempting to express all the pleasant parts of your story while hiding the less palatable facts. Thankfully, the potent Scorpio New Moon lands in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, giving you the power to overcome your fears and then bring them out into the open. Working through your resistance isn't possible if you keep denying valid concerns; adopt a fierce attitude and face your challenges head-on."
scorpio,2015-11-11,"You can do nearly anything now if you put your mind to it and commit to relentlessly executing your plan. It's as if you are carrying a secret vial of superpowers, but it's actually the New Moon's presence in your fixed sign. You must use this magic potion carefully or you might create more problems than you solve. Your efforts to save the world are admirable, but acknowledging your limits today can prevent disappointment tomorrow. Global transformation must start from within."
sagittarius,2015-11-11,"You might miss a rare opportunity to connect with someone close to you if you get lost in your desire for professional success, instead. You appear to be emotionally present and act as if you're living in the moment. But no one really knows what's going on behind your eyes today since the enigmatic Scorpio New Moon occurs in your 12th House of Secrets. Deep soul-searching could reveal that you're not yet ready to share your vulnerability with anyone else now. Trust your intuition to know when the time is right."
capricorn,2015-11-11,"You can engage people with calculated precision today, as if you are playing a competitive game of chess. However, your ideas may be more fixed now than others realize and you might not want to change your plans while the unrelenting Scorpio New Moon activates your 11th House of Goals. Trust your instincts and you'll know exactly what move to make next to keep the win within your grasp. Analyze every possible scenario with careful consideration; your single-mindedness could bring you victory sooner than you think."
aquarius,2015-11-11,"Long-term career goals take priority now that the Scorpio New Moon emphasizes your 10th House of Status. Your uncanny ability to control your emotions creates a magnetism that could have your biggest critics eating from your hand. But this gift is not to be used for the sole purpose of manipulation; instead, utilize your powers of persuasion thoughtfully so others will line up to be on your team. Integrate your altruistic intentions with strategic action for the best results."
pisces,2015-11-11,"Successful planning for the future requires you to have an accurate map that reveals the exact lay of the land. But sometimes getting your bearings is challenging, especially when the mysterious Scorpio New Moon is stimulating your 9th House of Big Ideas. Thankfully, you should land safely at your destination just in time, as long as you continue to visualize your arrival. Take the extra step and create an itinerary for the coming months so that you can stay on track as you move toward fulfilling your dreams."
aries,2015-11-12,"Just as the bumps on the road of life seem to smooth out, another obstacle stops you in your tracks today. Maybe you miscalculated the amount of work on your plate or perhaps you missed a pertinent piece of information. No matter what, there's no reason to complain. You might be self-critical because you could have seen the potential trouble if you paid closer attention. But instead of wasting energy second-guessing things you can't change, take care of the most immediate concerns as quickly as possible. The good news is your I-can-do-it attitude is both constructive and contagious."
taurus,2015-11-12,"You might try to hide your actions today because you're afraid of others misjudging your behavior as frivolous. You may believe you don't have anything important to add to the conversation, but chances are you just need more time to decide how to express yourself clearly. Don't worry about how anyone else will react. Just tell the truth exactly as you see it now; it's unlikely that you will be faulted for speaking from your heart if your message is authentic."
gemini,2015-11-12,"Your serious mood can have a negative impact on your coworkers today while unresolved issues sneak back into your awareness to haunt you. Oddly enough, you may experience a weird mix of excitement and concern as memories are triggered by someone close to you. Your attempts to avoid a meaningful discussion probably won't be successful now. Act proactively and start a conversation about what's on your mind instead of trying to ignore the truth. Wake up and take the initiative; it might as well be you who gets the ball rolling."
cancer,2015-11-12,"People may think you're being overly critical today, though you might not see yourself in this light. Your current sobering perspective stems from an apparent weak link in someone's story, and you're not willing to support a plan based upon sloppy logic. Don't try to bury your feelings; instead, just change the tone of your words. You can be honest without blaming anyone else in the process. Honoring your integrity is all that truly matters now."
leo,2015-11-12,"You could reach a turning point today as you secretly obsess about your shortcomings. Naturally, everyone has a regret or two; there are always things you could have done better or, perhaps shouldn't have done at all. Instead of pursuing perfection now, it's wise to just accept your limitations and admit that you are a flawed human. There's no time to throw a pity party. Shift your trajectory by compiling a list of everything you do well. The power of positive thinking tips the scales in your favor."
virgo,2015-11-12,"Your renowned analytical skills are operating on overdrive now that an exacting electric Mercury-Uranus alignment focuses your mind like a laser beam. Unfortunately, controlling the energy is out of the question today. There's no reason to undermine others with your sharp criticism; nothing is currently gained by nitpicking their work. Providing constructive feedback enables you to suggest potential improvements without resorting to negativity. Use your power of discernment wisely to bring out the best in everyone."
libra,2015-11-12,"You may feel stuck in a rut of routine in spite of your current craving for excitement. In fact, you could grow rather disillusioned today about your future prospects. Although a recent disappointment might deepen your malaise, don't make despondency a regular habit because your life is about to change for the better. Instead of reminiscing about an event in the past, switch your focus now and imagine the best possible scenario that could be waiting for you just around the next corner."
scorpio,2015-11-12,"Understanding where your life is leading these days is a real mystery; nevertheless, you believe you would be happier if you knew where to look for answers. Your pessimistic outlook weighs heavily on your heart and the burden of responsibilities you feel may not even be your own. Unfortunately, you can't invent an easy remedy to cure your current blues today. Believe it or not,  simply accepting your current uncertainty could be enough to transform your despair into hope. Don't lose faith in your dreams; the clouds will dissipate and the Sun will come out sooner than you think."
sagittarius,2015-11-12,"People seem to come out of the woodwork to tell you exactly what's wrong with your new plan today -- even if you're not asking for any feedback. Unfortunately, others aren't necessarily tactful in their assessment of your ideas. Additionally, you could be so sensitive now that you might make matters worse by responding ungraciously. Don't dwell on the negative; you have too much to do and there's no point in entertaining unproductive thoughts. Things will quickly improve once you stop talking and start listening."
capricorn,2015-11-12,"You're motivated to put extra time and effort on the job today or, perhaps, you're eager to add your expertise to a community project. Either way, your optimism is flagging now, leaving you with a sense of vulnerability about your future. Although you might wonder if all your hard work is actually worth it, it's not wise to retreat. Abandoning your plans won't help anyone; just be more realistic about your expectations so you can actually reach your goals on schedule. All is not lost if you keep a healthy perspective."
aquarius,2015-11-12,"Thinking about having fun is nearly impossible today while the dynamics at work are so serious. You might give up your dream for an upcoming getaway because you don't have enough time. It's prudent to focus your energy on something more practical that contributes to your stability, rather than escaping on a whimsical adventure. Sticking close to home makes good sense now; so don't push beyond safe limits until you feel as if you're back on more stable ground. Taking care of unfinished business is your first step to regaining control of your life."
pisces,2015-11-12,"If someone delivers a harsh message today, you really don't have to blindly accept his or her interpretation of reality. Nevertheless, if you trust the source, you may be overly susceptible to what you hear. Listen carefully to what others say now, but don't take anything too personally. Luckily, you can put whatever you learn into motion to improve your game if you assimilate the facts without an emotional charge. Remember, those close to you might truly have your best interests at heart."
aries,2015-11-13,"You might cling to a very practical notion about relationships today, along with an ambitious action plan to get what you want. Unfortunately, you may discover you need an entirely new strategy to manifest your dreams once you shift into gear. Admitting that you're wrong could prove to be a real challenge until you realize how much energy you're expending by trying to keep an old fantasy alive. Flexibility is your secret weapon now; don't be afraid to use it."
taurus,2015-11-13,"Knowing where you stand is essential because you like to have your feet on steady ground prior to building on it. However, your need for certainty could become a real showstopper, since nothing is as clear as it seems today. Your confusion creates obstacles as the day progresses, adding to your discomfort. It's wise to make an important decision as soon as possible so you can stop worrying and start relaxing, instead. Don't give up on your big idea when the going gets tough; your persistence will be rewarded if there's a solid foundation in place."
gemini,2015-11-13,"Your schedule is as complicated as your thought process while the Moon trines ingenious Uranus today. Unfortunately, you're also quite likely to suffer from poor time management skills now, which can seriously mess with your schedule. Although you may be a touch forgetful, the real problem is that your energy is just spread too thin once again. Stop making unnecessary commitments. Master Wordsmith, E.E. Cummings wrote, ""I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing than to teach ten thousand stars how not to dance."""
cancer,2015-11-13,"Gauging someone's reaction to your words is difficult now, no matter how confident you feel about your message. You may be anxious to take dramatic action on a lingering issue that has reached a tipping point. But as you make your move, you suddenly realize you can't tell if you're creating the impact you want. There's no need to worry if rave reviews don't come streaming in right away; it might take a while before you see the positive results of your efforts. In the meantime, believing in yourself sustains your momentum."
leo,2015-11-13,"You are quite pleased with your performance once others acknowledge your creative approach. However, your ability to express what's in your heart doesn't require anyone else's approval; your justification comes from within. Running through old scripts of what you wish you did or didn't do isn't very useful now. This intellectual chatter only clutters your mind with uncertainty or regret. Success is within your reach if you give your talent a chance to shine today and then move on without any attachment to the outcome."
virgo,2015-11-13,"You are a master of logic, but you could make a poor decision today if you rely on your head and not your heart. Your thoughts are bent out of shape by your desires now, making it pointless to employ any form of rationalization. Instead, let your emotions take you on the scenic route; you might not arrive at your destination on time, but you will experience more joy on the ride. It may sound silly, but happy feelings will attract happy circumstances."
libra,2015-11-13,"A casual friendship may have the chance to be strengthened while your key planet Venus forms a supportive sextile with stabilizing Saturn. However, your desires can run into a wall if you try too hard to force something to happen. Luckily, there's really nothing you have to do but flirt gently with your limits and keep the possibilities alive. If you play your cards right, you will reap the benefits of your patience later in the day. When it comes to the art of persuasion, less is more."
scorpio,2015-11-13,"You are fascinated by your fantasies of fame and fortune, but you prefer to keep your dreams under wraps. Unfortunately, your motives may be apparent today, challenging you to hide what you do from those who might pass judgment on you. Fortunately, your associates are more understanding than you think; there's no reason to keep your world compartmentalized now. Instead of distancing yourself from coworkers, be proud of the strength of your convictions. Your passion for life sets a fire under those who need a little inspiration to follow their dreams."
sagittarius,2015-11-13,"Dreaming about an upcoming journey can be very distracting today. Nevertheless, it's not such a great idea to finalize your travel plans because you could be limited by real world constraints. Rather than trying to make sensible choices now, you're tempted to listen to larger-than-life Jupiter and go for the grand gesture. Of course, a trip across town isn't the same thrill as hiking through the high peaks of Tibet. Finding middle ground between fantasy and reality is your quickest route to happiness."
capricorn,2015-11-13,"Your career plans fall into place today as people rally to join in your cause. However, you're oddly overtaken by a strong impulse to attend to the most basic chores now, like paying bills or doing laundry. Unfortunately, you might not possess the sufficient concentration to follow through on a boring task. Instead of starting something that you're not going to finish, consider taking the entire day off and letting your imagination roam wild and free. Your solid reputation precedes you; others will understand if you need a day for creative inspiration."
aquarius,2015-11-13,"Normally, you're determined to stick to your agenda, but someone can distract you from your destination today. You can't help but be inspired when a friend or colleague's endeavor catches your eye. Nevertheless, your ability to recognize what's most productive helps to motivate you to spread your wings. You must learn to trust your flashes of intuition and observe where your attractions pull you. Sometimes a short detour leads you to a better place."
pisces,2015-11-13,"You need to be clear about your priorities or your best intentions could be sidetracked by a simple twist of fate. Solid preparation and consistent execution of your plan is mandatory, but still may not be enough to avoid an unexpected surprise. Fortunately, being derailed off course can ultimately work to your advantage by creating anxiety, flooding your system with adrenaline and heightening your perceptions. You'll be operating at tip-top performance once reality has your undivided attention. Making progress is likely when you're firing on all cylinders in the present moment."
aries,2015-11-14,"Impulsive behavior may not bring you what you want today, especially if you irritate someone with your emotional intensity. You might choose to withdraw from the social scene in self-defense, but you won't resolve anything by overcompensating later in the day. Pay attention to your audience since they will tell you when to lighten up. It never hurts to look beyond your inclination to spontaneously share what's on your mind. Setting aside time for contemplation before you create an awkward situation is smarter than trying to clean up a big mess afterward."
taurus,2015-11-14,"It's beneficial to stand back for a bit in order to gain a healthy perspective on where the cosmic currents are taking you today. Thankfully, you can continue on your merry way if you are happy with your progress. However, you could always modify your direction if you grow dissatisfied with your personal trajectory. Instead of demonstrating your infamous dogged persistence, switching up your approach enables you to accomplish more. A change will do you good."
gemini,2015-11-14,"You may long for the return of the good old days -- a simpler time that seems to have slipped through your fingers. But there's no need to lose hope because your life is still in major transition mode now. The fun times aren't over just because a current situation demands your attention. Work through your intense feelings today, even if they aren't as pleasant as you prefer. The only way out of your current predicament is through the center of the storm."
cancer,2015-11-14,"A close friend or relative could be a source of annoying resistance today. Unfortunately, it may be nearly impossible to put your finger on the origin of the conflict now. Be careful; your investigation might put others on the defense, which only adds to the subtle negativity in the air. Instead of pretending you can figure everything out on your own, it's better to wait and see how the situation unfolds. You'll have a much better grasp of your options after the dust settles and your clarity returns."
leo,2015-11-14,"You would like to speak your mind today, but you may choose to withhold your thoughts for just a little while longer. You're not afraid to stir up powerful reactions in your coworkers, although you might not see any point in dredging up past mistakes just to provoke anyone. Nevertheless, finding a way to productively channel your own negative emotions lessens the pressure during this critical point. Approaching the subject from a more objective perspective gives everyone a chance to co-exist in a drama-free environment."
virgo,2015-11-14,"Reexamining your assumptions about love could shed new light on an important relationship. Or, if you're involved with a social group today, it may be necessary to balance your agenda with everyone else's goals. But there's no need to be afraid of raising any subject now, no matter how controversial. Discussing what you learn in this process with your friends could actually bring you closer together. Demonstrating your vulnerability inspires others to follow your lead and open their hearts, too."
libra,2015-11-14,"Someone may place demands on you today, complicating your schedule because you can't say no. It's challenging to think about letting anyone down, especially since you want your friends to come through for you whenever you need them in return. But it doesn't matter what your motivation is for saying yes; take this cosmic opportunity and conquer your own insecurities. Make decisions based on the wishes of your heart and not on the expectations of anyone else. Living life without regret is an admirable goal."
scorpio,2015-11-14,"You have an unexpected chance today to see things that are usually buried far out of sight. Instead of resisting the truth, you can integrate what you discover when shadowy Pluto receives an illuminating glance from the Sun. Your personal power increases as long as you let your newly found knowledge transform your current perspective. Anything is possible if you're willing to acknowledge you don't have all the answers. Paradoxically, adopting a beginner's mind enables you to be a master of the unknown."
sagittarius,2015-11-14,"A sentimental journey down Memory Lane today puts you back in touch with all the changes you experienced over the past several years. Your personal evolutionary process has transformed you from a lowly caterpillar into a magnificent butterfly. Regardless of how much you have already grown, this transition is still in process. Use your emotions to fuel the ongoing metamorphosis, but keep bringing your thoughts back to the present moment; you have important work to do now before moving on."
capricorn,2015-11-14,"You can't escape the pressure of change today, even if you face it indirectly through a relationship with another person. You're not necessarily exempt from the planetary intensity of the day, but others appear to be even more overwhelmed by the prospects of relentless transformation. Don't become overly complacent just because life isn't a big struggle these days. Consider yourself lucky and offer support wherever it's needed the most. For of those to whom much is given, much is required."
aquarius,2015-11-14,"You're not interested in defending your feelings against attack today because it's stressful enough just to understand them yourself. As a general rule, your irrational emotions aren't always comfortable intermingling with your rational thoughts. Nevertheless, you realize something big is at stake and you're willing to do whatever it takes to manifest your dreams. Remember, cool logic won't help you now as much as simply honoring what's in your heart."
pisces,2015-11-14,"As the days grow shorter and shorter in the Northern Hemisphere, you might find yourself traversing your own dark night of the soul as you question the purpose of your life. Thankfully, this spiritual wandering won't last long, enabling you to return to more practical issues that need your attention. If you are doubting yourself or your goals today, exercise patience before making any rash decisions. Keep the faith; you will see the world in a brand new light in a few days."
aries,2015-11-15,"You might assume that working hard today will enable you to complete everything expected of you. However, a creative aspect between the Sun and ingenious Uranus can ignite distracting fireworks. An unexpected series of events could suddenly transform your day into a temporary obstacle course. Nevertheless, don't blame your troubles on anyone else; how you handle your responsibilities is ultimately your call. The cosmos is testing your resiliency so there's little to do but laugh."
taurus,2015-11-15,"There are too many alternatives to choose from today as you contemplate where you want to go next. But your resources are limited by the current circumstances, forcing you to be clever enough to find the best route to your goals. Whether you lack money or time, don't pilfer your energy by micromanaging the details of every contingency. Narrow the field of options prior to fine-tuning your plan. Nevertheless, leaving room for the element of surprise may make all the difference in the world."
gemini,2015-11-15,"It's growing more apparent that you can't do every single thing you set your heart on, even if you're ready to give it your all. Unfortunately, burning your candle at both ends will exhaust you without any guarantee that you will accomplish your goals. Try a totally different tactic now by employing self-discipline right from the start. Paring back your activities will make you more productive in the long run. Remember, a laser-like approach is better than a scattered one."
cancer,2015-11-15,"Being sensitive to the needs of others is one of your most admirable traits, but it's unhealthy if your happiness is totally dependent on someone else's feelings. The problem with placing the sole determinant of your emotional well-being in other people's hands is that you can't take responsibility for their shifting moods. Fortunately, you can have a positive impact on a situation by changing your priorities. Remember, nurturing those you love begins with taking care of yourself."
leo,2015-11-15,"Although this should be a day of rest, you're already worried about tomorrow. You're acutely aware of the increasing emotional tension that exists between you and your workmates. Unfortunately, you may not know how to navigate these dicey dynamics. You might mistakenly believe you can change your behavior without addressing your true feelings. Nevertheless, you will only fuel additional conflict today by pretending that everything is okay. There's no question about it: if you want things to improve, radical honesty is your only viable option."
virgo,2015-11-15,"Thankfully, the intensity level at home seems to be more manageable today, yet you're still not convinced that everything is truly returning back to normal. To the contrary, you might be wondering if anything in your life will ever be the same. Luckily, you don't need to take major action now. Although this is a stressful period, maintaining a positive outlook on current events has a direct impact on the future. You must first visualize greatness if you are to achieve it."
libra,2015-11-15,"You may create an unnecessary crisis by attempting to squeeze one too many activities into your busy schedule today. There's so much to do that you can't possibly feel satisfied by the amount you manage to accomplish while the ambitious Capricorn Moon visits your 4th House of Family. Unfortunately, your stress level won't likely prevent you from attempting the impossible. Nevertheless, the sooner you simplify your life, the more time you'll have available for the ones you love."
scorpio,2015-11-15,"Perhaps you recently missed a chance to share what's on your mind with your friends. Unfortunately, the window of opportunity is starting to close, so you must get the conversational ball rolling as quickly as possible today. You might want to wait for the perfect moment to declare your truth, but the time for contemplation is over. Anything that currently remains unsaid may be banished into the shadows for an indeterminate amount of time. Speak now or forever hold your piece."
sagittarius,2015-11-15,"You must be serious-minded about your current commitments  and you expect others to respect your no-nonsense attitude. However, you still may be unable to concentrate on your pressing obligations due to your wandering imagination. Saying all the right words is easy; however, it's quite another thing to put them into action. Good intentions won't take you as far as you want to go today; you have to walk your talk to be recognized. Work now, dream later."
capricorn,2015-11-15,"You might claim you're not obsessed with getting ahead now, but the dynamics of a relationship are changing and you want to make the most of the situation. It's tempting to ignore the immediate pressure, but the current emotional instability may be just the catalyst you need to propel you into your next developmental phase. However, it's not just about seizing an irresistible opportunity; the real potential comes from reconnecting with your heart's desires. Happily, outer progress becomes less problematic once you're in touch with your soul."
aquarius,2015-11-15,"Floating through the day by doing as little as possible sounds like a recipe for fun, but you won't likely get away with this lovely plan of escape now. Although you might linger over the breakfast table, you may retrospectively wish that you worked harder in the morning. You can't accept a surprise invitation later in the day if you're not finished with your chores. Thankfully, unexpected pleasures could be yours if you fulfill your responsibilities in a timely manner. Finding a healthy balance between work and play sets you up for success."
pisces,2015-11-15,"Your confidence wanes as the day wears on, and you might have second thoughts about attending a social event later this evening. But retreating for a short while prior to your night out enables you to emerge physically revitalized and emotionally refreshed, ready to fight off unnecessary change. Don't be afraid of expressing your own power now, even if you think that you should wait for a better time to act. Just remember to choose your battles wisely when your integrity is at stake."
aries,2015-11-16,"It seems as if events are happening for no reason today, befuddling your thinking and throwing off your entire game. Nevertheless, you're not one to give up without a fight, especially since you are expected to accomplish measurable results. On the other hand, if you can spend the day in spiritual practice or watching waves at the beach, then all may be going just as planned. Ultimately, the less you try to do now, the more likely you will find peace. Although it's not cosmically feasible to exercise complete control over your environment, there is much to be learned from simply letting go."
taurus,2015-11-16,"Your stress level rises when someone won't play according to your rules. In fact, others might even go so far as to tell you that your approach is not viable. In general, scheming to gain advantage won't likely work out in your favor since there are too many hidden forces influencing the outcome of your plan. Assume a low profile now for the best results. You can jump back into the driver's seat tomorrow if you don't exhaust yourself shadowboxing today."
gemini,2015-11-16,"You might have to rethink your immediate career objectives due to constraints on your time. It's not that your work is taking longer than you planned; it's just that you may have bitten off more than you can chew. Nevertheless, it's best to stay on your current course for a while longer; altering your trajectory now will only create more problems than it solves. Don't make any impulsive decisions today as you will likely change your mind a few more times before you land on the best solution. Patience is your friend."
cancer,2015-11-16,"Generally speaking, you water-loving Crabs aren't all that comfortable when the Moon takes up residence in dry Capricorn. However, the low emotional tide might actually bring relief to an otherwise challenging day by offering you some much-needed common sense. You may be overwhelmed by a lack of clarity in a current relationship because it's impossible to read the energy of your friend or lover today. Nevertheless, it's not wise to succumb to the temptation to grasp at straws for the sake of stability now. Find your security from within before asking anything of others."
leo,2015-11-16,"You could be sending mixed messages now without even realizing it. Your need to be efficient at work today is being challenged by the power of your overactive imagination. Although you're unwilling to compromise your dreams, the ambitions of others can further stimulate your own personal fantasies. Luckily, there's no need to resolve this dilemma now; just stay aware of the potential effect your choices have on everyone else. In the long run, your dedication to your goals will create a greater impact than anything else."
virgo,2015-11-16,"Wrapping your logical mind around the complexity of the forces at work is impossible today. Although cerebral Mercury inspires you to process the unfathomable information being presented by transformational Pluto, comprehension still remains just beyond your grasp now. Nevertheless, your current mission is to deepen your psychological understanding of your relationships. Don't be dismayed by this daunting task; determination is your greatest ally at this time. Delving into the mysteries of love is a curiously captivating endeavor."
libra,2015-11-16,"Finding balance in your life could be a study in frustration today because something is drawing you to step out of the mundane world and into your subconscious mind. Although you may be required to follow through on your real obligations anyhow, you realize the vital importance of your inner world. However, you're better off finishing your tasks first before pursuing your spiritual quest. Honoring your priorities is essential now, no matter how compelling your soul's journey seems in the moment."
scorpio,2015-11-16,"Although you harbor great hopes of moving an ongoing discussion into a more meaningful direction, the conversation might not go according to your wishes. The provocative Moon's cosmic hookup with your key planet Pluto just won't leave you alone today, creating difficulties as you attempt to communicate your intense feelings to your friends and coworkers. Thankfully, a healthy debate can work to your advantage if you're willing to adapt to the changing dynamics. Let go of your attachment to any preconceived outcome and simply seek satisfaction by staying present in each moment."
sagittarius,2015-11-16,"Your stubbornness may prove problematic today, especially if you are adamant about sticking to your own way of doing things. It feels as if your work is being called into question by someone who attempts to exert power over you. Although you naturally think in broad strokes, a disagreement could result from a simple misunderstanding now. Preventing a major conflict might be as easy as focusing on the details. Whether you are talking or listening, leave no stone unturned."
capricorn,2015-11-16,"Others appear to be withholding their feelings from you today, but it's possible that you're the one who is being overly guarded. You may be unusually pessimistic now because you're driven to understand the dynamics at play, even if the real issues are buried deep beneath the surface. The more determined you are to uncover the truth, the more you have to dig. However, don't go back to try to solve an old mystery; just move on and pay closer attention in the future. The hidden secrets will come out in the open when you stop relentlessly searching for them."
aquarius,2015-11-16,"A personal issue demands that you redirect your focus away from career matters today. However, it's frustrating that your intention to make things right isn't enough. In fact, you might not be able to find any quick and easy fixes to your current dilemma. Nevertheless, your heartfelt sincerity eases the stress at home and on the job. Do whatever you can along the way without forcing your preferred solution on anyone else. Ultimately, the river will find its way to the sea without major interference on your part."
pisces,2015-11-16,"Your plans may be disrupted today by circumstances beyond your control. Your first inclination is to resist any changes, but you could wear yourself out fighting the inevitable. Don't put too much effort toward getting your day back on track. Instead, give yourself some leeway and let the unfolding events continue to determine what you should do next. Your flexible attitude holds the key to your current happiness."
aries,2015-11-17,"Smoother sailing in your interactions with others today sets the stage for what's to come next -- and you may already be dreaming about the future. You can't help but envision so many wonderful possibilities ahead. Unfortunately, trouble arises pretty quickly if you're not focusing on your current obligations. Slow down; even if you have moved on in your mind, you will still need to be patient while reality catches up to your fantasy."
taurus,2015-11-17,"Although you sometimes can be quite obstinate in your communication with others, you might be tempted to bring inflexibility to a whole new level of expression today. Unfortunately, your unwillingness to bend may create more problems than solutions, even if your intentions are pure. The most effective tactic now is to state your position clearly and then negotiate as needed. Meeting a worthy opponent halfway also demonstrates your respect for someone else's point of view. Common ground is better than no ground at all."
gemini,2015-11-17,"You're tempted to keep all your great ideas to yourself today because you believe it will take too long to justify your plans. You might even assume that others will reject your logic while interactive Mercury rubs friendly Venus the wrong way. Nevertheless, it's a bad idea to overreact and go silent when you could be busy improving your delivery. Don't waste this opportunity; breaking down your recipe for success into bite-sized pieces will move you along in the direction of your goals."
cancer,2015-11-17,"You are so wary about everyone's reactions to what you share now that it's tricky to get your tone to match your intent. No matter how much you try to fine-tune your delivery, you may feel as if you're overstating your case or not saying enough. Still, you're determined to get it right. If you don't give up and walk away, the cosmos just might surprise you and give you what you want. Thankfully, your tenacity is working in your favor now."
leo,2015-11-17,"Your peers seem set in their own ways today, leaving you with little room to express your opinion. If you say what you really feel, a conflict could ensue; but if you don't speak your piece, you may end up dealing with misplaced anger or resentment later on. Handling your emotions calmly in the here and now is a less stressful strategy than pretending all is well for the sake of expediency. Do what it right, not what is easy."
virgo,2015-11-17,"Although you wish you could take the day off, there are just too many tasks for you to finish. You could try to forget about your responsibilities and not show up, but it's not your style to leave everyone else high and dry. There's really no point in running away since you won't be able to stop thinking about your chores until they are done anyway. Bite the bullet and get to work. The fun can wait and will be even more enjoyable if you're free of your obligations."
libra,2015-11-17,"At first blush you may feel uncomfortable and doubt your abilities, but as the day wears on you begin to believe you can set your mind to nearly anything and accomplish it. In fact, your spirits soar today as the Moon dances into your 5th House of Creativity, even if you have an intense situation unfolding in your life. You have the gift of gab on your side now, enabling you to talk your way through almost any crisis. Use your infamous charm to work through any potentially embarrassing moments and don't let up until you see your magic beginning to work."
scorpio,2015-11-17,"You must be methodical in your communication today or your plans may backfire on you. Think through everything you want to say before you open your mouth. The less you leave up in the air, the better it will be for everyone involved. Although you might be tempted to reveal your feelings, try to be as logical and rational as possible. A cool, calm and collected approach isn't your normal style, but will work wonders for you now."
sagittarius,2015-11-17,"Your subconscious mind is releasing powerful images now, but it can be all too easy to miss the show because of the activity in your immediate environment. You must block out the distracting noise so you can sink into the language of myth and symbol. In order to tune into this subtle dimension today, you need to set more practical thoughts aside. Relying on your intuition to interpret the messages allows you to discover new ways to maximize your current potential."
capricorn,2015-11-17,"You may take your own beliefs a bit too seriously now, but your friends will appreciate your honesty, nonetheless. You are at the top of your game when communicating with your peers while the Sun-Mercury conjunction lights up your 11th House of Social Networking. Don't water down your message to make it more palatable. Saying exactly what you feel today is the most effective path to move toward the success you seek."
aquarius,2015-11-17,"There's something about your interactions with others that helps you maximize your current capabilities. You have the sense to know what you want to do, but it is the back and forth of collaboration with your peers that can turn a good idea into a great project. Instead of presenting a finished product, share a bit of your vision and then let everyone jump in with their thoughts. Helen Keller wrote, ""Alone we can do so little; together we can do so much."""
pisces,2015-11-17,"Although you are more than willing to drift into your dreams, it's better to focus on the existing circumstances today as much as possible. However, the Moon is meandering through your 12th House of Escapism, confusing your thoughts with fantasies. Nevertheless, incorporating your imagination into your personal life can be rewarding. Each time you catch your mind wandering, bring your attention back to the here and now. Exploring your subconscious is fine as long as you take care of business in the present moment."
aries,2015-11-18,"It's time to face your own ghosts before jumping in to tackle the issues of your friends and family. Your role within your peer group can become quite muddled over the months ahead if you don't conquer your fear of getting lost in the crowd. You may be searching for happiness through your relationships, but serenity of mind and heart cannot be found until you first find peace within yourself. Imagine that you could be a caterpillar one moment and a butterfly the next."
taurus,2015-11-18,"Your rigidity can get the best of you today unless you notice the warning signs in time. Observe your tendency to grow agitated while you are defending your position or arguing your point of view. Stop long enough to reconsider your priorities before you engage in any unnecessary power struggles. Your conclusions will help you decide if you need to hold your posture or if you benefit more by letting it go. Out with the old, in with the new."
gemini,2015-11-18,"Your long-held beliefs could be the source of duress today. It's not that the waves of self-doubt are threatening to your well-being, it's just that dancing at the edge may bring up old fears that stand in the way of your creativity. Although your past might be holding you back now, give yourself permission to have fun interacting with others, anyhow. You won't fall over the cliff as long as you stay conscious of the present moment. Counting your blessings inspires you to greater heights."
cancer,2015-11-18,"Maintaining your individual perspective while still remaining receptive to the opinions of others is more complicated than you think. Contrary to your current logic, your uncertainty is not a sign of instability. Instead, it may be more representative of your resiliency, allowing your emotions to move in their naturally fluid manner. Still, it's critical to keep up your regular routine because it's unhealthy to let your needs get washed away in the tides of everyone else's feelings. Paradoxically, building a strong foundation is possible even while going with the flow."
leo,2015-11-18,"A sudden epiphany may surprisingly open new doorways in your quest for love and romance. But this newly found awareness won't necessarily make life easier, for you can plainly see where your pride gets in your own way. You are known for your generosity of spirit and have plenty of affection to bestow on others. Rest assured that you can improve your most important relationships by sharing what's on your mind with an open heart. Giving the gift of yourself is a perfect place to start."
virgo,2015-11-18,"You don't feel like following the rules at work today because you're afraid that you might lose the substantial progress you've already made. Usually, your mental flexibility allows you to incorporate new information and make rational choices based upon what you learn. But if you spend time fighting the inevitable now, you may end up missing important facts which can return to bite you later on. Take a deep breath and make a different plan. Luckily, falling back on your innate need for methodical analysis will serve you well."
libra,2015-11-18,"You might find yourself trapped in a difficult situation today, but this dilemma has probably been brewing for quite a while. However, your frustration reaches a climax now as you realize there isn't an easy way out. Unfortunately, a sudden breakthrough won't necessarily bring you a fast solution. Just keep moving toward your own vulnerability so you come out the other side even stronger. Your emotional authenticity saves the day."
scorpio,2015-11-18,"You could be somewhat disconnected from your innermost feelings but, oddly enough, this disassociation won't necessarily make you uncomfortable today. Think of it as a short vacation from your personal world of intensity. You haven't lost anything essential; whatever passion you're missing now will return shortly. There's no reason to panic if you just observe your process and maintain your wicked sense of humor."
sagittarius,2015-11-18,"Although you may be over the rainbow with optimism today, you still have much to gain by taking life more seriously. Keep the communication channels wide open, even if something pops up on your radar screen that is less than positive. Don't remain silent just to preserve a cavalier appearance. It's more crucial to talk about what is real now than what is possible. Honesty is the best policy for all parties involved."
capricorn,2015-11-18,"Your tail is dragging today, especially if you haven't been taking proper care of yourself. Your energy is running on empty and the stresses you are currently juggling may seem like just too much to manage. Although your discomfort might be physical, the solution will be found in the spiritual realms now. Rest while you can, for you're going to need all your strength to face the challenges in front of you. Pray now, work later."
aquarius,2015-11-18,"Your moods continue to shift throughout the day and your current changeability takes its toll on those closest to you. Still, it's critical to keep expressing your feelings today, regardless of the resistance you might receive from others. Let your fluctuating needs register on the surface, for everyone will see through your attempts to hide them, anyway. Transparency works in your favor when you're telling the truth right from the start."
pisces,2015-11-18,"A vaguely familiar issue is back for another round of contemplation now. Handling this blast from the past may be rather stressful, for you're not in the mood to talk about your feelings today. The good news is you don't need to say anything at all. This emotional journey is about facing your shortcomings, examining your fears and learning from your mistakes. A little bit of courage goes a long way to pave the road to a brighter future."
aries,2015-11-19,"You assumed you were right on track, but now you could realize how much you must change just to keep up with the shifting landscape. If you aren't comfortable with your place in the outer world now, look to your long-term goals for clues as to what you should be doing today. Increasing your awareness is necessary prior to making any meaningful alterations to your direction. The answers to your questions can be found within."
taurus,2015-11-19,"It seems as if time is running out when it comes to stabilizing your relationship world. Interpersonal dynamics are in flux and the speed at which they change can be a bit dizzying. Don't try to intellectualize this emotional journey today; there will be plenty of time for understanding the reasons later on. Right now, just stay in the present moment by listening to your heart and remaining open to the feelings of others. Love doesn't always play by the rules."
gemini,2015-11-19,"Although you may not be certain about someone's intentions today, you still may pretend that doubt doesn't even appear on your radar. Nevertheless, you must also be careful about projecting over-inflated optimism for the next couple of days, which could make matters worse instead of better. Noticing your own insecurities as they arise can prevent petty arguments that might increase your loneliness in the long run. Lead by example; acknowledging your vulnerability allows others to do the same."
cancer,2015-11-19,"Life is all about making choices and it is healthier today to decide sooner than later. Of course, you can do what comes naturally and hide safely within your own inner world. Unfortunately, this self-protective strategy keeps others from realizing how much you have to offer. Or, you could take a different route and face the cause of your fears. This seemingly dangerous path could initiate a major healing process and deepen the intimacy of your relationships. No risk, no reward."
leo,2015-11-19,"You are worried about being misunderstood today, but success ultimately depends less on how others see you than on how you see yourself. You may not want to fit into the expected norms of society, but you still wish to belong to a larger community. Finding that sweet spot of emotional bonding while maintaining individuality is a challenge. Reestablish relationship dynamics by including those you love in your vision of the future. You could be pleasantly surprised with the support you receive if you remain true to yourself."
virgo,2015-11-19,"People are making unreasonable demands on your time, but behind the front lines of engagement you need to create some semblance of peace and quiet. Unfortunately, the current chaos in your life may not quiet down for a few more days as the Moon's visit to your 7th House of Others will likely call you into action. You might not be sure of your path yet, but you can buy yourself some time by choosing the right people to be around. Your heightened sensitivity means it's more important than ever to surround yourself with those who support your dreams."
libra,2015-11-19,"Your current annoyance on the job can't be directed at anyone in particular today, making it nearly impossible to express your true feelings. Put your emotional angst to good use by tackling a significant project. However, trying to finish it right away will only reactivate your frustration now. Pace yourself to prevent burning out before your work is done. You don't have to go fast; you just have to go."
scorpio,2015-11-19,"The power of romantic inspiration wakes you up when the evocative Moon snuggles with imaginative Neptune in your 5th House of Love. But nothing is simple now; your spiritual goals are not easily integrated with your emotional life. Nevertheless, it's productive to talk about what is important to you as long as you don't expect a quick fix to your current dilemma. Patience is the key which unlocks the solution to your quest for happiness."
sagittarius,2015-11-19,"There's an edge to your emotional instability today that encourages you to roll with the unexpected waves coming your way. Don't bother constructing a barrier to keep the changes at bay, for this tired strategy just won't work. Instead, utilize clever Mercury's presence in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness to create a strong spiritual foundation that can't be shaken by external events. No matter how busy you are now, find time to recharge your soul."
capricorn,2015-11-19,"Processing all the fantastic images that float into your awareness now can be rather overwhelming. Whatever your intentions are for the day, don't avoid the immediate tasks at hand. Luckily, you might be able to accomplish something important with what you learn today. You won't likely feel comfortable if you focus only on production when your imagination is so fertile. Ironically, you can find the stability you seek by relinquishing the pursuit of your ambitions and wandering around in your dreams."
aquarius,2015-11-19,"You might be considering which of your values aren't reflected in your current career path, yet this self-examination is not cause for despair. Quite likely there are lessons waiting for you now, but you must accept your vulnerability before you can appreciate the knowledge. Don't take the easy way out by withdrawing into silence today. Express yourself, even if it could wound your pride. The walls you build for protection also keep out the joy."
pisces,2015-11-19,"You may have meticulously planned your day down to the last minute, but you face a good chance of seeing reality subtly slip off its hinges, anyway. If unfulfilled relationship desires are creating a cloud of sadness now, don't push the feelings away. Or, if your job is a source of headaches today, just bite the bullet and meet your responsibilities. Regardless of what issues you face, stick to your initial agenda the best you can. Your dogged persistence will bring rewards if you stop asking questions and get to work."
aries,2015-11-20,"You're not one to keep your feelings quiet, yet you might overreact today when dealing with someone who seems to be on your case. Unfortunately, you may not realize how overbearing you sound when defending your position. Your smartest strategy is to downplay any anger that surfaces now so you don't frighten others with your tone. No matter how intense your emotions are in the moment, a more diplomatic approach improves your chances of finding a successful resolution."
taurus,2015-11-20,"The interpersonal dynamics are more complicated than they appear today. The real reason for a conflict isn't necessarily the obvious one while magnetic Venus squares relentless Pluto, creating discord in love or instigating an argument at work. However, the current disagreement may actually be the designated playing field for a deeper issue that needs your attention. Keep in mind that there's no reason to avoid what you don't understand, especially if you want to see positive change happen."
gemini,2015-11-20,"Sharing your unfiltered desires can act as an emotional catalyst, transforming them into healthier expressions of your needs. However, talking about psychological issues isn't that simple, especially if you say one thing while meaning something else. Although you may believe your message is clear, others might not understand your intentions. Nevertheless, taking the time to connect with your peers in a deeper way now enriches your relationships and brings comfort to your soul."
cancer,2015-11-20,"Someone special wants you to engage in a cathartic process today that has the potential to revolutionize your life. Although your initial reaction may be to run for the nearest exit, a magnetic attraction pulls you back, even if you think it's not a great idea. You could try setting clear boundaries to protect yourself from losing control, but you might be unhappily surprised to discover that you're in deeper than you thought now. There's no need to retreat; ultimately, a change will do you a world of good."
leo,2015-11-20,"You aren't feeling as casual with your heart as you expected today; something has drastically changed and you're more inclined to play to win. You may suddenly realize that you're in over your head as the fervent Venus-Pluto square increases the heat on a romance. Oddly enough, you're simultaneously drawn toward a more metaphysical orientation to love. Tread carefully and maintain a healthy balance between a physical and a spiritual approach to relationships."
virgo,2015-11-20,"Uncomfortable feelings trigger serious issues around your basic values and how they conflict with someone else's. Differences seem insurmountable today if you and your partner possess divergent views. Various attempts to convince the other person of his or her guilt are fruitless. Rather than shifting blame to anyone else now, try a more cooperative approach based on mutual respect. Follow your dream while encouraging others to follow theirs."
libra,2015-11-20,"There might be hidden truths that need to be spoken today. Or, maybe, someone is keeping his or her true feelings secret. Removing yourself from danger is always wise, but this situation is less about being safe than it is about your fear of being alone. Fortunately, resourceful Venus is in your corner now, enabling you to calm down and figure out how to overcome the resistance. Your natural inclination to create harmony will set the right tone for an honest conversation."
scorpio,2015-11-20,"Honoring your integrity is your top priority as you strive to uncover a complex set of emotions that have all but disappeared. However, you're astute enough to realize that sharing all your feelings could be counterproductive now. Stress arises from not knowing how much you should reveal while sweet Venus squares domineering Pluto. Fortunately, there's no hurry to take action today; wait a few more days before climbing too far out on a limb or you might fall flat on your face."
sagittarius,2015-11-20,"Your thinking shifts today as you grow less interested in prolonging a recent drama. Mercury steps into your farseeing sign, drawing your attention toward the intriguing adventures down the road. You may try to avoid negativity or jealousy, but can't get past your feelings in the present moment. You prefer to take the high road and move on, but denial won't solve the underlying problems. Your friends might offer useful advice, but you will have to ask nicely for their help before they're willing to give it."
capricorn,2015-11-20,"Naturally you aim to be practical in all your endeavors, yet circumstances pull you into a heavy emotional stew today where nothing is clear. You could be annoyed with someone who pushes your buttons, but then won't interact with you in a constructive discussion. Even if you are willing to talk about your feelings, you may be at cross-purposes with one another. Nevertheless, don't be overly concerned if you can't resolve the discord today because the energies will change significantly over the days ahead. No one said that love would be easy, but it shouldn't have to be so hard."
aquarius,2015-11-20,"Everyone seems to be taking your dreams more seriously these days, yet you're afraid this creative phase won't last too much longer. You can stir up an emotional drama with a close partner today, especially if he or she thinks that your long-term plans are illogical. Be careful, because you could become obsessed with a new idea now, even if it ultimately makes little sense. Listen to the advice you receive with a flexible mind and an open heart."
pisces,2015-11-20,"Your attraction to a loved one is complicated by unexpressed negativity today. Or, perhaps you believe others are attempting to coerce you into agreeing with them. Thankfully, you're too clever to be dominated by someone's show of force and you can quickly escape from the clutches of insecure emotions now. Stay vigilant; it may require a few more days until you're able to put some time between you and your past."
aries,2015-11-21,"Not much will get in your way today except for your imagination, either inspiring you to greater heights or triggering a bit of depression. Nevertheless, it would be a shame to waste all the positive potential in your life by succumbing to your doubts or fears. Ultimately, you own the power to create your future by using your dreams to set long-term goals. Once you establish new priorities, start making practical plans for the days ahead. Preparation now increases your chances for success later on."
taurus,2015-11-21,"Your emotions lure you right to the brink of action, yet at the very last moment you might change your mind. Sometimes it takes a serious wake-up call to motivate you to make a commitment and swing into motion, but not today. You have an opportunity to make significant progress if you can just push past your own self-imposed limits. Take a small step. Follow it with another, and another. Carpe diem!"
gemini,2015-11-21,"Your mind is like a hot air balloon today as your thoughts rise high above the mundane events of your life. Your enthusiasm soars and you feel as if you can accomplish nearly anything. Unfortunately, your sense of reality may be distorted, but don't let your blind optimism prevent you from attempting the impossible. Ironically, you just might surprise everyone with your success, including yourself."
cancer,2015-11-21,"Your excitement entices you beyond the security of the fences guarding your perimeter today. As a hard-shelled Crab, you naturally seek emotional protection; nevertheless, you are known to let down your guard with close friends and family. Go ahead and take care of your business in the outer world, but don't linger there too long. Return to the safety of your nest to nurture yourself and your loved ones. Those closest to your heart are your link to the past and your bridge to the future."
leo,2015-11-21,"Your anticipation is palpable and your inspiration is admirable. It might feel as if you are buckled in for the ride of a lifetime, but you may crave even more of an adrenaline rush now. If only you could find someone to give you the keys to a jet plane -- your lack of flying skills wouldn't be enough to stop you today. You might find yourself in a pile of trouble if you don't slow down and think before you act. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
virgo,2015-11-21,"Although you can feel the electricity in the air now, you're uncertain that all systems are go. You're still somewhat hesitant and might choose to hold off a little longer before initiating launch sequence. This tendency to wait is a familiar dynamic to you perfectionist Virgos. However, if anyone accuses you of being too picky today, just remind them that your cautious logic has proven valuable in the past. Trust your instincts and only take action once you know the coast is clear."
libra,2015-11-21,"As the premier hosts of the zodiac, you feel blessed with an extra layer of good cheer today and you're eager to take any opportunity to shine your light. You're at the top of your game now, capable of turning your intuitive hunches into concrete action. Your ultimate goal is to put others at ease and you can do this as long as you don't get too attached to your own agenda. Start the ball rolling, but don't micromanage its path. Allowing things to take their own course contributes to your peace of mind and makes others happier along the way."
scorpio,2015-11-21,"Don't forget to notice the most apparent and obvious details, even while searching for the meaning of life. Ironically, the greatest magic isn't found in a hidden mystery, but is right there in plain sight. Valuable spiritual epiphanies are yours for the taking today if you focus your awareness on what's happening in front of your nose. Sometimes questions are extremely complicated, yet the answers are very simple."
sagittarius,2015-11-21,"Living up to other people's expectations is challenging today, especially if you're busy obsessing over your long-term goals. However, you must be discerning about what you say; if anyone realizes that you're not fully present, they may not want to work or play with you. Although it's nerve-wracking to juggle both realities, there is undeniable potential to your dreams and you have a serious chance to make them real. Life is a tricky balancing act between the past, present and future."
capricorn,2015-11-21,"You may be annoyed as you attempt to weigh the thrill of the outer circumstantial events now with your innate need to be responsible. It's crucial to allow yourself the flexibility of spontaneous emotional reaction. There's no reason to calculate your response today; just act as you feel, even if additional preparation would put you more at ease. Leaning into your discomfort helps to dissipate your concerns while you cross things off your to-do list one at a time."
aquarius,2015-11-21,"A conflict in your immediate surroundings could demand your undivided attention for a while today. The problem is that a small misunderstanding might pull a conversation off center before you even know it. Thankfully, if you respond directly, everything probably can be settled before it blows out of proportion. In fact, if you're honest about your feelings, it will be difficult to wander too far off topic. Your job is simple now: strive for clarity in your words and then stop talking long enough to listen with your heart."
pisces,2015-11-21,"Your overactive imagination lurks around every corner today, but you can finish your chores if you keep your goals in sight. Although you can't drift off into La-La-Land, luckily, you are quite capable of maintaining professional appearances while still exploring your rainbow-colored dreams. Now, more than ever, your practical world is intertwined with your spiritual practice. Taking care of business is required; pursuing enlightenment is optional."
aries,2015-11-22,"You might believe you can accomplish anything you choose today, but you must be careful that you do not overstate your case or overstep your boundaries. Nevertheless, even if you promise more than you can deliver, your over-commitment could be good news in disguise. This is your chance to catalyze change by getting the truth out into the open. Ambition is the first step to success; the second step is action."
taurus,2015-11-22,"Your charm can lead to plenty of trouble today, especially in the realm of partnerships. The truth is you may be  actively seeking trouble just to rattle someone's cage. But keep in mind that your common sense is wildly distorted now, so don't jump into a commitment before you think it through completely. Tiptoe carefully around any potential  emotional traps such as guilt or jealousy. Like quicksand, it's easier to get into a murky situation than to get out of it."
gemini,2015-11-22,"It seems as if you're living in a different world now that the Sun is shining in your 7th House of Relationships. Everything has changed but strangely, it's all the same. Your point of view is shifting because you can see your current circumstances from someone else's perspective. But you're still confused about your various options. You are accelerating through a star gate and will emerge in some distant galaxy soon enough. Make good choices today so you have no regrets tomorrow."
cancer,2015-11-22,"Your passions are more manageable today since you can envision new possibilities ahead of you. Although you are aware of your feelings, you might not know the best way to deal with the intensity. You may wonder how to share your emotions without scaring away the very same people you want to attract. Rather than worrying about divulging too much, just let your own judgment guide you as to what should and should not be revealed. Ultimately, it's not what you say; it's how you say it."
leo,2015-11-22,"Although you appear ready to roll with the incoming waves of revolution, you may feel more stuck than anyone realizes. Your resistance is growing now, so your irrational opinions are not up for negotiation. You know what's in your heart and that's the end of the story. Nevertheless, your willingness to discuss the origins of your emotions can transform a challenging interaction into a positive experience. When you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change."
virgo,2015-11-22,"A fresh breeze is blowing through the caverns of your mind, lifting your thoughts as they ride the winds of change. However, you may be confronted with a problem as your awareness shifts, for you don't necessarily want to leave all of your prior concerns behind. Your newly acquired optimism won't substantially alter the nature of the conflict you now face. Accept your new attitude with gratitude, but don't run away from your past."
libra,2015-11-22,"You are attempting to cultivate a more detached relationship with someone now, so that you can remain on the sidelines of an unpleasant situation. It's wise not to get caught up in a battle that isn't yours. However, if another person questions your values, defend your beliefs without blowing everything out of proportion. If you temporarily lose perspective, you'll attract additional problems. Nevertheless, you can't change what you refuse to confront. Delivering a rational message is your safest bet for a drama-free response."
scorpio,2015-11-22,"It might seem as if an era is coming to an end and you nostalgically long for whatever you are leaving behind. Although the Sun is emphasizing your 2nd House of Possessions, it's not necessarily about anything material. In true Scorpio style, you may try to control time itself as it continues to march forward. As much as you attempt to hold onto the present moment, it isn't yours to keep. Take the changes in stride by focusing on one step at a time as you head into your future. Fortune favors the bold."
sagittarius,2015-11-22,"The rowdy Sagittarius party is just getting started, but the mood could suddenly turn serious later today. Thankfully, the heaviness should quickly pass if you already paid your dues. Practice wishcraft; this is your time to celebrate while the Sun shines in your sign for the next four weeks. There's no need to only blow out candles on your birthday. Do it often, but don't ask for more than your fair share. If you can keep your desires in check, the power of manifestation is yours."
capricorn,2015-11-22,"You are seriously considering a variety of strategies that would allow you to go into hiding today. However, reality has something completely different in mind for you. There's just too much activity for you to sneak off into a cave without being missed right away. But you won't get any peace once your absence is noticed anyway, so you may as well go with the social flow for now. Make plans to retreat later on when you're less in demand and it's safe to escape."
aquarius,2015-11-22,"Family and friends are spicing up your calendar, even more than the holiday season would suggest. This is good news, for you are especially eager now to mix and mingle with groups of like-minded people. It's advisable to watch your energy level, for it may be difficult to contain your excitement. However, if you limit your activities just a touch, you will have the endurance you need to go the distance. Spreading joy is its own delightful reward."
pisces,2015-11-22,"It's as if a new circuit in your brain is activated now, awakening you from a deep sleep. Instead of struggling to handle your obligations in the real world, you're suddenly looking forward to demonstrating your competence. However, you must be careful about your newfound exhilaration; you can easily overdo it and find yourself too tired to complete whatever you start. Instead of trying to finish everything today, make a strategic plan for the entire week. Establishing a pace you can sustain is your key to success."
aries,2015-11-23,"It's not unusual for you to react quickly in an emotionally volatile situation. Unfortunately, your goals may not be fully clear yet, so giving them time to develop works to your advantage. You have an opportunity to open your horizons and move in an entirely new direction if you don't rush the process. Although you might be eager to run the race, wait until you hear the shot of the starting gun before you take off. Life is a marathon, not a sprint."
taurus,2015-11-23,"You can imagine a wide variety of potential pleasures today, although you might not be able to manifest what you see in your mind's eye. Your intuition may unexpectedly distract you from your chosen course of action, leaving you slightly apprehensive and uncertain about what to do next. However, making a choice is only difficult if you believe you must decide now. Stop trying so hard to fix on one particular path while the obvious cosmic message is to enjoy the endless parade of possibilities."
gemini,2015-11-23,"Lightning is striking everywhere you look and everything seems to be in transition now. Luckily, you're more than ready for change, but the grip that relationship commitments have on your life isn't loosening as fast as you prefer. You are itching to go somewhere today, but your feet seem to be stuck in mud. However, there's no need to panic since you're about to be set free. Make the most of this cosmic storm by mapping out your next move in advance."
cancer,2015-11-23,"Increased freedom of movement comes with a price now, for it might not sit right with your idea of emotional security. Circumstances seem out of whack as relationship tension drives you close to the edge of your tolerance. Trust your sense of self-restraint even if others are encouraging you to take initiative today. You're the only one who truly knows what will serve your heart best."
leo,2015-11-23,"Maintaining your position among your peers can be tricky business today, even if it feels like resistance to change is a good idea. Although you might try to remain quiet as long as possible, something must give because the pressure continues to build. Nothing will be gained by slipping into denial, so let your heart do the talking now. Instead of resorting to blame or threats, just state your truth and prepare to quickly back up your plan with concrete action."
virgo,2015-11-23,"You may be at the end of your rope with little left to try that you haven't already done. The good news is that you carry a bit of metaphysical magic up your sleeve today, if only you can trust the unknown enough to take a risk. You could happily surprise yourself once you stop struggling. Relax and you might just escape in the nick of time. Believing in your own power completely changes the rules of the game."
libra,2015-11-23,"Your destination appears to slip out of sight but you still may feel so close that the anticipation drives you crazy today. You might have to wait on pins and needles, yet you understand you're part of a bigger picture that you can't control. Rest assured you are being asked to slow down for a significant reason now -- even if you don't yet know what it is. Be patient; the energy is about to break loose and you will likely reach your goal sooner than you think."
scorpio,2015-11-23,"You might worry that your plans are being thwarted by someone who means well, yet doesn't understand your dreams for the future. But don't lose faith now because something big is about to happen. An unexpected shift could blast you into a new universe, but you must initiate the change by realizing your own power. Oddly enough, if you allow your perspective to transform organically, the world around you will respond faster than you can imagine."
sagittarius,2015-11-23,"Your confidence is on the rebound, but you still may struggle regulating how much energy you spend. You could vacillate between unbridled enthusiasm and cautious pessimism today. Your mood swings might make people nervous unless you can temper your extreme feelings. Thankfully, your emotional reactions are neither as negative nor as positive as it seems in the moment. Whenever in doubt, standing on middle ground is your safest bet."
capricorn,2015-11-23,"You feel like an Olympic sprinter at the starting gate before the big race. You have completed so many practice runs that you know every inch of the track and you could do it with your eyes closed today. But your impatience can get the best of you before the contest even begins, throwing you off stride. Take a few deep breaths and visualize crossing the finish line with the cheers of the crowd ringing in your ears. Learn to play the waiting game now and victory will be yours in due time."
aquarius,2015-11-23,"Your plans for the future grow more nebulous now, and no matter how clever your tactics, your path won't clear for a while. Allow yourself to step beyond logic, even if you're not totally comfortable in the subjective realm of feelings. Remember that the emotional world is safer than you might think and can even be nurturing if you have the courage to let down your guard. If you're still feeling disoriented today, keep in mind that your confusion will fade once you surrender to your heart."
pisces,2015-11-23,"You don't know which way the shifting tides will ultimately carry you, since their current direction is misleading. Your relationships may not be changing as you thought they would and you're unsure where to turn. However, your inner world is transforming now while your imagination grows richer with new ideas. Let your thoughts flow and enjoy the fruits of your fantasies instead of worrying about the restrictions of reality."
aries,2015-11-24,"Cautious optimism is your key phrase today. You might not be sitting on top of the world, but you're well on your way to reaching new heights. But don't attempt to stretch too far or you'll end up sabotaging your plans. Acknowledging the limitations of your schedule prevents disappointment for all parties involved. Running into a wall of resistance isn't much fun but once you accept the circumstances that are beyond your control, you can make corrective adjustments to your calendar. Instead of aspiring to conquer the world, find satisfaction from mastering yourself."
taurus,2015-11-24,"The contrast between your inner world and outer circumstances is glaringly obvious now. But there's no time for self-pity if your reality seems very far removed from your dreams. Rather than wistfully peering off into the distance today, your top priority is to meet your most immediate obligations. It's as if you're being tested by the cosmos. You must pass the current exam to graduate in order to be offered exciting opportunities in the weeks ahead."
gemini,2015-11-24,"Your partner or close friend can be of assistance today, but you must be open to receiving their help. Unfortunately, you may be somewhat confused about what's most important now and might inadvertently brush their kindness aside to pursue a social distraction, instead. But rather than digging yourself out of a mess in a few days, maintain a close connection with those who encourage your ambitions. Demonstrate your wisdom by establishing your priorities early in the day and expressing gratitude to your support network."
cancer,2015-11-24,"Be careful of people coloring facts with enthusiasm to sell you a bill of goods now. If someone effusively declares how great everything will be in the future, take a deep breath and then ask a lot of hard-hitting questions. Others may not even realize the extent of their inflationary thinking today, but that doesn't mean you need to be their next unsuspecting victim. Retreating from the group for a while enables you to draw your own conclusions. Keeping yourself on track is as simple as following the trail to the truth."
leo,2015-11-24,Helping people less fortunate than you may be the most amazing medicine for your heart these days. It really doesn't matter whether you're nurturing your children or assisting at a local animal shelter as long as you creatively express your generous spirit. There's no reason to worry about the things you can't fix; just do what you can with your limited resources. Your most sincere actions are the best ones and they will gather momentum throughout the day. One good turn deserves another.
virgo,2015-11-24,"Your home and family are the center of your world now. However, there's a catch; you may be feeling so distracted today that you want to shake things up. You're eager to expand your social horizons, but your time is restrained by more immediate emotional connections on the home front. Make sure that you know what you're getting into before you say yes. All the excitement you seek might be much closer than you realize."
libra,2015-11-24,"You must tread lightly today when you tell others why you can't join in their activities. You intuitively realize you could be easily swayed off your own path if you get lost in someone else's cause today. Your current resistance makes you more vulnerable if someone pushes you to step beyond your comfort zone. You might easily overreact if you're swept up in a swirl of emotions. Nevertheless, you don't have to give in; you know what you feel now and no one can change your mind except for you."
scorpio,2015-11-24,"You are running on an adrenaline high today; your energy is buzzing, whether or not you drank any coffee this morning. Unfortunately, getting enough sleep may be a challenge now, since your system is on high alert and you are wired for action. Meanwhile, you know that you can't continue driving around in circles with nothing to show for your efforts. Take the time to check in with your inner GPS and make sure that you're still on course before you downshift and apply the gas."
sagittarius,2015-11-24,"Your current idealism continues to draw you far outside of your regular routine. Move forward strategically now, since you'll actually feel safer once you break through your preconceived notions. Luckily, your growth is supported by the actions of people you might not even know. No matter what happens, act with caution until you're confident that all the logistics are securely in place. In the meantime, trust your instincts today above all else."
capricorn,2015-11-24,"Keeping up with all of your responsibilities today is nearly impossible. But worrying isn't a productive use of your time; everything will turn out fine if you simply remember that your dreams are not real. Bring your attention back to your current obligations now or you could sail into the impenetrable mists of your own fantasies and crash on the rocks. Fortunately, acknowledging your commitments right from the start increases your chances for success."
aquarius,2015-11-24,"You might be subject to bouts of pessimistic thinking as you confront an obstacle that's blocking your progress. You're enthusiastic about accomplishing everything on your list now, yet knowing where to apply your energy doesn't come easily. Chances are your resources are already stretched to the max, so don't waste time dwelling on your fears. The sooner you get things moving in the right direction, the more time you'll have later for your own personal pursuits."
pisces,2015-11-24,"You may be tempted to abandon your job-related responsibilities in favor of chasing your dreams of pleasure. However, there's no way you can let others down when they are depending on you to keep everything on schedule. Put your best foot forward today; go out and do what is being asked of you. Although you might complain at first, your work will be more fun than you expect once you are in the flow. A positive attitude makes all the difference in the world."
aries,2015-11-25,"Being nice to yourself is one thing, but over-indulgence is an entirely different story. The playful Gemini Full Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to involve others in your mischief. Unfortunately, reality is filtered by your biases today, presenting you with only part of the truth. Nevertheless, you're still compelled to direct everyone else based on what you think you know -- even if your facts are slightly distorted. William Blake wrote, ""The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom."""
taurus,2015-11-25,"You are dazzled by all the bright lights and brilliant ideas while the witty Gemini Full Moon floods your 2nd House of Self-Worth. But recognizing the value in other people's perspectives doesn't have to threaten your own. Thankfully, there's no reason to go into denial about your feelings just because you're going along with the crowd. Keep communication channels open and be ready to learn something surprising about yourself. Inspiration comes from the unlikeliest sources."
gemini,2015-11-25,"You can sense the cosmic pull of your emotions, but transforming your feelings into action isn't as straightforward as it sounds. The Full Moon falls in your sign and opposes stern Saturn in your 7th House of Others, magnifying the tension in relationship dynamics. It helps to remember that you can lose perspective now by giving too much importance to your changing moods. Wait until the storms pass before taking any extreme measures. What seems incredibly critical today might be seen as a passing whim tomorrow."
cancer,2015-11-25,"The current emotional high tides can bounce you around on the seas of change, even if others can't see your inner turmoil on the outside. You are like a chameleon as you absorb the energy of the reflective Gemini Full Moon in your 12th House of Invisibility. Rather than hiding your colorful dreams from view, reveal a secret to someone close to you. Being vulnerable may feel scary at first, but taking a risk leads to a tender experience and sparks a spiritual epiphany."
leo,2015-11-25,"You can't be everything to everyone today, even if you try with all your might. The Gemini Full Moon highlights your 11th House of Social Networking, fueling your desire to be accepted and admired by the group. Unfortunately, you can become too involved too quickly if you let your personal responsibilities slide. Consider a temporary retreat from the situation if you find yourself in too deep. Establish your exit strategy now, but wait a few days before doing anything that might spoil the party."
virgo,2015-11-25,"The complexity of too many conflicting plans at work may have your stomach tied up in knots. You are hoping the dynamics will return to normal soon, since you're stretched far enough in too many directions. You want your old life back, but it probably won't happen for a while because the insatiably curious Gemini Moon accentuates your 10th House of Career. Manage your day by making whatever necessary adjustments you must to keep the peace, but don't settle for less in the long run."
libra,2015-11-25,"Sharing your aspirations with close friends is a lovely pastime while the chatty Gemini Full Moon brightens your 9th House of Distant Horizons. Although your emotions may not be consistent now, you still remain doggedly fixed on the general direction of your personal plot. Keep in mind that it might not be productive to make long-range plans today, but it is prime time to dream of all the idealistic scenarios that could stretch across your future."
scorpio,2015-11-25,"Your mind is hyperactive with so many thoughts today that you can't discern the useful ones from the superfluous noise. It's as if you're compelled to run through every possible trajectory for each relationship in your life. The friendly Gemini Full Moon shines in your 8th House of Intimacy, strengthening your resolve to make the most of every personal connection, whether or not it matches up to your dreams. Don't try to micromanage the flow of events or you could inadvertently attract the opposite of what you want. A light touch is better than a heavy hand."
sagittarius,2015-11-25,"Your patience is pushed to the limit by close friends and coworkers who seem to change their minds every few minutes today. You can't keep up with all the drama while the restless Gemini Full Moon agitates your 7th House of Others. Unfortunately, you are very susceptible to the chaos all around you and might allow it to distract you from your work. But don't isolate yourself from those who could benefit from your honest opinion. Ironically, you can also learn something significant now, if you're willing to listen as much as you speak."
capricorn,2015-11-25,"There are so many variables at work today, it's nearly impossible to map out a sensible strategy. Your associates may be making demands on your time, whether spoken or implied, but you can't tell what they really want. The scattered Gemini Full Moon's presence in your 6th House of Details complicates the dynamics even further, but you won't solve anything by just walking away. Taking a tentative first step is easier once you admit you don't know where to begin. The truth will set you free."
aquarius,2015-11-25,"You love riding a creative high, except there's so much going on in your world now that you might begin to feel panicky. The flighty Gemini Full Moon lights up your 5th House of Spontaneity, but you're afraid that following your bliss isn't productive. Instead, your nagging insecurity drives you to put everything in your life back into a manageable order, but regaining total control could be a hopeless goal today. Remember, your current lack of efficiency doesn't mean you're doing anything wrong. Don't sell yourself short; your intuitive choices will make more sense in a few days."
pisces,2015-11-25,"Taking on extra responsibilities is one way of demonstrating your commitment to your peers. But the inquisitive Gemini Full Moon occurs in your 4th House of Foundations, reflecting the light back into your private world. You don't like feeling the pressure to maintain control of outer events when the inner realms are calling your name so convincingly. Ultimately, it could be beneficial to surrender to the whims of your imagination today. Sometimes the greatest clarity comes from within."
aries,2015-11-26,"You're capable of sinking into deep and dark places today while still maintaining an outer air of confidence. Others may accuse you of being in denial, but they couldn't be further from the truth. You can brush up against the emotional pain, but you choose not to dwell in it. Acknowledging your fears enables you to navigate through troubling circumstances and emerge victorious on the other side. Just don't move so quickly now that you miss the lessons you need to learn."
taurus,2015-11-26,"Naturally, you prefer experiencing pleasure in the present moment, but you also are motivated by a strong moral compass. Unfortunately, you might believe you must choose one approach or the other. But this isn't the end of the story, for your attempts to incorporate both aspects of yourself create your current dilemma. Finding your way through your existential crisis takes you on a journey into your own subconscious mind. What you find there can help you be a happier person in the real world."
gemini,2015-11-26,"Your high ideals don't always match up with the reality of your relationships. Reaching your goals today becomes a struggle if someone close to you seems to be an obstacle to your success. Instead of just accepting another person's lack of faith in you, stand firm in your convictions. Use your talent to think on your feet to decide what you want out of the current situation and then lay your cards out on the table. Once you're clear about your destination, there's no reason to hide your intentions."
cancer,2015-11-26,"Finding a middle path is a challenging task today, especially with respect to the patterns and routines of your everyday life. There are specific things you wish to improve upon, but you prefer to create change gradually. Nevertheless, you might have to make significant shifts in your daily habits in order to produce a lasting affect now. Shaking everything up may sound radical, but the positive results will be worth it in the long run."
leo,2015-11-26,"You might be obsessing over a current relationship or a potential romance. Sometimes, it's best to keep your desires to yourself. Other times, it can be transformative to share your feelings with someone you trust. Naturally, it's always wise to be socially appropriate; observe the boundaries and don't overstep them unless it's an emergency. Nevertheless, choosing how much to disclose is ultimately your decision, so take time to quiet your mind and tune into your heart."
virgo,2015-11-26,"Your anticipation of the future is too great to be contained by your current social conditions. Even if others are giving you permission to do whatever it takes to resolve the conflict between your personal and professional life, don't believe them. Irresponsible behavior may be fine for other signs, but you conscientious Virgos are expected to carry the torch for ethics and integrity. Don't sacrifice your ideals for what seems to be a quick solution to a complex dilemma. Follow your heart and you won't go wrong."
libra,2015-11-26,"Your thoughts are soaring today, zipping in and out of the clouds of your mind. You can catch glimpses of them from your pragmatic position on the ground, and yet it's challenging to latch onto any one image and turn it into reality. Accept that you may not be ready to go public with plans that others might judge as too outrageous. Instead, let the ideas come and go for now. The best ones will continue to gain traction in the weeks ahead. Err on the side of caution when it comes to maintaining your credibility."
scorpio,2015-11-26,"Although you're willing to alter your course as needed now, you're not going to go through the motions until you believe it's absolutely necessary. Fortunately, you are a master at work as you journey into the shamanic realms of dreamy visions. Use your multitasking skills to walk in multiple worlds and manifest the seeds of personal transformation."
sagittarius,2015-11-26,"The pressure to change continues to build all around you, especially in your personal world. Thankfully, if you remain flexible in your thinking today, you can cultivate a wonderful peace even in the midst of turmoil. The eye of a hurricane is a weird place; as still as everything is, you must stay on high alert every moment in case the energy shifts. Turn up the volume on your psychic radar, for magic is definitely in the air."
capricorn,2015-11-26,"Balancing your fantasies with your responsibilities within a relationship can be a full-time job today. You normally honor your promises without hesitation, but now your deep feelings are driven by even deeper compulsions that might not support your previous commitments. Don't make any dramatic changes yet; just sit with your discomfort. The issues that are coming to light won't pass quickly, but will feed your soul over the next few months in ways you can't even imagine."
aquarius,2015-11-26,"You tend to intellectualize your emotions, but today it might be the other way around. Your thoughts carry an extra emotional charge, making it easy to become overly zealous about what you believe is true. You may be at odds with your colleagues or friends over a looming decision about the future. If you find yourself obsessing about this conflict, back off just enough to regain a healthy perspective. Clarity is elusive now but will be within your grasp soon enough."
pisces,2015-11-26,"Just as you begin to settle into your new responsibilities, you are confronted by so much data that the details are overwhelming. You may threaten to throw in the towel today, but your conscience won't let you do it. Instead, this is an opportunity to engage in a dance between the power of knowing the truth and the need to trust your intuition -- even if these two extremes are in direct conflict now. Find a place to stand where you can honor both approaches and you will make the most out of this pivotal turning point."

Your thoughts carry an extra emotional charge, making it easy to become overly zealous about what you believe is true. You may be at odds with your colleagues or friends over a looming decision about the future. If you find yourself obsessing about this conflict, back off just enough to regain a healthy perspective. Clarity is elusive now but will be within your grasp soon enough."
pisces,2015-11-27,"Just as you begin to settle into your new responsibilities, you are confronted by so much data that the details are overwhelming. You may threaten to throw in the towel today, but your conscience won't let you do it. Instead, this is an opportunity to engage in a dance between the power of knowing the truth and the need to trust your intuition -- even if these two extremes are in direct conflict now. Find a place to stand where you can honor both approaches and you will make the most out of this pivotal turning point."
aries,2015-11-28,"You think you're being sensitive to others, but you're probably not looking much beyond your own ambitions. Instead of just assuming that everyone else has goals similar to yours today, take the time to ask them what they actually want. Keep in mind that you must listen to what people say without trying to convince them to change their minds. Ironically, sometimes your heart is the happiest when you set your personal agenda aside and respond directly to the needs of those you love."
taurus,2015-11-28,"You might resist participating in the starry-eyed schemes of others today. You know your limits and don't want to end up wasting your valuable time and resources on anything that distracts you from achieving your own goals. However, you're hesitant to just walk away now, especially if the opportunity presented seems too good to be true. Don't fall victim to your current idealism. Be practical and wait a few days before actually saying yes. Timing is everything."
gemini,2015-11-28,"Hide your credit cards today because you could easily get in over your head by buying something that's beyond your means. Unfortunately, a potential investment may not turn out as lucrative as it appears. You might believe you are in control of your analytical faculties, but that's because you can't see how the facts are being distorted now. Double-check everything you are told before taking a financial risk. Ben Franklin wrote, ""Distrust and caution are the parents of security."""
cancer,2015-11-28,"Managing your emotions is harder than it looks, especially while the receptive Moon is swimming through moody Cancer. To complicate matters even more, someone may sincerely believe the fabrications they are telling you today, making it tough to know if something is awry. Unfortunately, constant suspicion on your part could create its own set of problems as people react to your negativity. Don't be overtly dismissive, but take the time to run the story you hear by a trustworthy friend. Verify all the details before making any promises you can't keep."
leo,2015-11-28,"Your financial plans require another review today because your previous assessment may have been overly optimistic. But don't overreact to the current reality check by panicking and cashing in your chips. Although your confidence can take a hit now, your pocketbook will come out fine in the end if you practice patience. Avoid making a rash decision by scaling back your short-term expectations. Fortunately, this rough patch could turn out to be just a temporary dip and you won't face any unnecessary loss in the long run."
virgo,2015-11-28,"You are most likely operating under unrealistic expectations about a relationship. Or, you might grow frustrated as you go out of your way to please your friends today. In fact, it's quite tempting to expect more from people than they can possibly deliver when your standards are so high. However, instead of fixating on your desired outcome, concentrate on the blessings of the present moment. There's no point in setting up a worst-case scenario in the future when you can focus on the positive power of now."
libra,2015-11-28,"Although you may be hesitant to share your feelings today, keep in mind that your words will convey more power than you actually intend. Others can't tell whether you are being overly pessimistic in your evaluation of the situation or if they are reading more into your disclosure because of their inflated expectations. Either way, you can avoid simple misunderstandings by toning down the urgency of your message. Less intensity in your delivery works wonders now when it comes to keeping the peace."
scorpio,2015-11-28,"You must remember that there are limited productive hours in the day because many of them must be reserved for essentials like sleeping and eating. Although you can pack a lot of activity into short periods of time, your current tendency is to take on more than you should. You might claim that you're being practical or even cautious, but you could convince yourself of nearly anything today. Minimize your commitments before things get out of hand; walking on the safe side of the street enables you to give your best."
sagittarius,2015-11-28,"Your interest in learning new ideas now might open up an unexpected avenue of exploration as you seek to understand the mysteries of the universe. But everyone doesn't need to know all the details about your latest spiritual quest or even that you are questioning the meaning of life. However, keeping up outer appearances doesn't mean you have to accept everything you hear as the truth. A dose of healthy skepticism today can save you from a massive headache tomorrow."
capricorn,2015-11-28,"You are often the person that everyone runs to for advice because they perceive you as seeing the future through a wise and practical lens. You are exceptionally clear about what is worth pursuing today. Fantasy can be your great escape some other day when no one is relying on you. While others may gloss over the potential problems in a plan now, you quickly spot the flaws and limitations. Your invaluable contribution isn't about being a Debbie Downer; it's about keeping it real."
aquarius,2015-11-28,"You believe that you must share every single detail in order to get your point across clearly today. Unfortunately, your intentions could become lost in your valiant attempts to convey just the right emotional nuance. Spending too much time on the little things now can actually detract from your meaning. After a certain point, others will just tune you out. Keep your message succinct to create the biggest impact. Leave your audience wanting more, not less."
pisces,2015-11-28,"Sitting down for a heart-to-heart chat might seem like a smart move today, but you'll only alienate those you love if you disclose too many secrets. People may encourage you to open up more because they think it's their duty to listen, and they want you to know that you can count on them to have your back. Luckily, there's no need to shut out friends and family if you keep your personal desires in perspective. Never underestimate the power of moderation when it comes to unburdening your soul."
aries,2015-11-29,"Your promise means business today, for once you make a decision you won't be able to easily change your mind. Unfortunately, your judgment might be off if you assume you can talk your way out of a commitment. Whether you are considering making a move, changing jobs or switching schools, it's crucial to take your time and think through all your options before choosing what to do next. Patience is a virtue, especially when there is so much at stake."
taurus,2015-11-29,"You may need to manage some money matters today, and it could be a hassle dealing with all the details. The Sun-Saturn conjunction falls in your 8th House of Shared Resources, requiring you to have a heart-to-heart talk with a family member or business partner. Or, perhaps, tax or insurance issues need to be ironed out. Whatever serious concerns come to light, don't procrastinate. Take care of business now or it could become even more complicated in the future. A stitch in time saves nine."
gemini,2015-11-29,"If you try to avoid taking full responsibility for your actions today, someone else might do it for you. But if others point out your shortcomings now, your reaction may be to blame them for complicating your life. Even if people just want to help, it could be difficult to respond positively to their constructive criticism. Nevertheless, you might have to modify your behavior even if it turns your life upside down. Don't expect to see changes until you're willing to make them yourself."
cancer,2015-11-29,"The plot of your personal story thickens as your previous commitments take precedence over fun and games. There are many aspects of your life that are dependent on others and you often take the lead from the cues of those around you. You may be eager to kick back and relax today, but someone else might have an entirely different plan in mind for you. Resistance is futile now; it's best to meet your obligations with a positive attitude and a smile."
leo,2015-11-29,"Although there are chores that must be completed today, you won't need to forego all pursuits of pleasure. In fact, establishing a predetermined amount of time for structured recreation can be exactly what you need to be more productive in the long run. Don't just impulsively bolt from your work whenever you feel like it; instead, take advantage of Saturn's persistence by creating a schedule and sticking to it. Demonstrate your willingness to play by the rules by showing up and doing your job whether you feel like it or not."
virgo,2015-11-29,"You might be required to make a significant choice today that will impact your personal life or your future plans for the family. Perhaps you need to participate in serious discussions about the care of an elderly relative or the schooling of a youngster. Maybe someone is overstepping your boundaries in a way that threatens your sense of independence. Whatever the specifics are now, allow enough time to resolve your domestic dilemma so you can have more freedom to roam later on."
libra,2015-11-29,"Although many people celebrate this as a day of rest, your schedule won't likely allow you much room to to recharge your batteries. Today's Sun-Saturn conjunction adds weight to your 3rd House of Learning, making this an ideal time to begin a new course of study. But your current interest in education is not meant to be a frivolous exercise to distract yourself from what's important. Choose a subject that is practical enough to improve your everyday life in a positive and lasting manner."
scorpio,2015-11-29,"You may be overly self-critical today as you compare your achievements with your failures. The Sun illuminates your shortcomings when it joins judgmental Saturn in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. Concentrate your energy on completing tasks that will make you feel good about your accomplishments. Regrets are wasted energy; if your thoughts begin to turn to what you did wrong in the past, quickly shift your focus to what you can do right in the present moment. Energy flows where attention goes."
sagittarius,2015-11-29,"Sometimes your innate ability to project generalized concepts so far into the future complicates your decision-making about a specific event in the here and now. However, you're successfully able to narrow your field of vision today so you can focus your intentions on whatever you consider most important. Don't worry about losing sight of the big picture. You will be given an opportunity later on to balance your ambitious drive with your need to be fair. The present moment is where the real action is at."
capricorn,2015-11-29,"Vacillating between accurate analysis and fuzzy thinking can be a bit exhausting today, especially if you can't tell which is which. However, if you do get confused, don't be afraid to ask for help. Usually, you are the one assisting others with your pragmatic perspective, but now it's your turn to lean on someone else for a change. Thankfully, your trust won't likely be misplaced if you pick your allies wisely."
aquarius,2015-11-29,"Your social calendar may be a source of concern now, especially if you have overcommitted your time. The Sun-Saturn conjunction crystallizes the energy in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, enabling you to be more realistic than ever while making plans for your future. But remember that Saturn can also bend your thoughts in a pessimistic direction. There's no need to sing the blues today because the clouds should begin to lift by tomorrow."
pisces,2015-11-29,"You don't have to accept the negativity if someone rains on your parade today. There's no reason to just assume that you have done something wrong. Instead, look directly at the resistance you now face as a lesson from the universe. Even if your original attempt was not met with much enthusiasm, don't give up on your goals. Instead, work even harder to prove that you're willing to sacrifice immediate gratification for the possibility of an enduring success."
aries,2015-11-30,"You're like a little kid today, mischievously searching for your next round of fun and games. You yearn to display affection to someone you love while the Moon brightens your 5th House of Play. Nevertheless, you may think that everything will remain perfect if you continue to avoid the truth. Your current state of grace won't last forever, so face the facts while your creative powers are operating at their optimum. Maturity is knowing when childish behavior is acceptable and when it's not."
taurus,2015-11-30,"Your visionary approach to your work can gain you bonus points from your superiors today. Although your boss might hold you in high regard now, it's challenging to grasp the real intentions behind your lofty ideas. Don't add noise to the existing confusion by letting too many words take the punch out of your message. The more you talk, the greater the possibility of contradicting yourself. Let your brilliant actions make the best impression."
gemini,2015-11-30,"Although your schedule seems hectic today while the lively Leo Moon flies through your 3rd House of Distractions, you still can float through the day without feeling much stress. Your ability to manifest your dreams is so strong now that just like Cinderella, you can turn a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage in your mind. In fact, very little will slow you down, but your overall perspective may be a bit warped. Don't be afraid of your fantasies; they have the power to propel you into your perfect future."
cancer,2015-11-30,"You may believe you have established an easy equilibrium in your family life, but the emotional complexity can catch you off guard today. Unfortunately, your immediate reaction to an unexpected turn of events could be more shocking than whatever triggered your outburst. Count to ten and take plenty of deep breathes to regain your center. Think twice before letting a rush of adrenaline hijack your future. No drama, no regret."
leo,2015-11-30,"You might feel as if your life is on the launch pad today. Thankfully, your stamina is strong as karmic Saturn and the radiant Sun trine the Moon in your 1st House of Self this morning. The power is yours, but your current burst of self-confidence might come and go without leaving a trace unless you put your positive attitude to work. Just watch out for your blind spot; ignoring the facts could cause a delay in liftoff. Fortunately, you can reach the stars if you take the time to do your due diligence first."
virgo,2015-11-30,"Sometimes you do your best work behind the curtains, and the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Secrets pushes you even deeper into your inner world now. Your reaction to someone's non-committal behavior can be so visceral today that you can't put it into words. Unfortunately, bottled-up feelings have negative consequences, so fight against your tendency to withdraw emotionally. Tell others what you're experiencing as kindly as possible, and then let the chips fall where they may."
libra,2015-11-30,"Your need to strengthen your social network takes precedence these days. In fact, you could be so  enthusiastic to connect with others now that you book personal activities when you should be working. Nevertheless, you might just be able to get away with an extended coffee break or an extra long lunch. Thankfully, kicking back with your friends may be very inspirational today, setting the stage for an efficient workday tomorrow when you can cheerfully make up for lost time."
scorpio,2015-11-30,"You're operating as if you possess superpowers today, enabling you to accomplish more than you thought possible while the proud Leo Moon is strutting her stuff in your 10th House of Career. You're at the top of your professional game now, but you still need to convince yourself that it's acceptable to work for your own success rather than just doing as you're told. Instead of acquiescing to the  expectations of others, fight to make your dreams come true. The magic of the cosmos is on your side."
sagittarius,2015-11-30,"Socializing with a group of coworkers or relaxing with a few friends might be the most healing thing you can do for yourself today. You may have big career plans in mind but driving toward your goals is frustrating if you're not making as much progress as you desire. However, it's inadvisable to just let go of your aspirations, even if they take additional time to materialize. Ironically, applying less gas now could be the catalyst that reignites your forward movement."
capricorn,2015-11-30,"You could be quite unrealistic about your long-term goals because three planets congregating in your 12th House of Spirituality take your mind off your work. Although you can see far off into the distance, it's still challenging to separate your fantasies from what's real today. Give yourself sufficient time to deliver on your current promises. However, you won't be happy if you just fritter away the day while daydreaming about your future. No matter how it appears in the present moment, taking direct action now is your key to satisfaction."
aquarius,2015-11-30,"You may be involved in a relationship that pulls you into new territory while planets harmonize with the playful Leo Moon in your 7th House of Companions. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know how pushy you need to be in order to get the conversational ball rolling today. On the other hand, you might choose to withdraw if someone else's aggressive behavior makes you uncomfortable now. Ultimately, following your intuition is your smartest strategy when it comes to the game of love."
pisces,2015-11-30,"Holding your cards close to your chest sounds like a great plan today, but getting caught up in office politics or sucked into someone else's melodrama is all too likely. Your hypersensitivity is on high alert now, making you more susceptible to the emotional ploys of others than you realize. Thankfully, it's possible to be sympathetic without losing your objectivity. One way to reestablish balance is to throw yourself into your work today so there's not much time left over for wandering into dangerous territory."
aries,2015-12-01,"Excitement mounts as you consider every angle of a creative project today. You're eager to get started, but you can't figure out how to organize all your ideas. Your reactions are so swift now that you inadvertently overwhelm others while sharing your plans. Think before you speak because you probably sound more outrageous than you realize. Keep your audience in mind and tailor your delivery accordingly. In fact, it might be smart not to say anything at all. Let your art express your heart."
taurus,2015-12-01,"Rather than spinning your wheels and going nowhere fast, channel your energy into creating a joyful environment, instead. The showy Leo Moon visits your 4th House of Home and Family, inspiring you to redecorate around the house to take your mind off more complicated issues at work. Nevertheless, you can't stop the flow of your thoughts; thankfully, you can exert enough control to shift your focus to more pleasurable pursuits. Oprah Winfrey advises, ""The more you praise and celebrate your life, the more there is in life to celebrate."""
gemini,2015-12-01,"Discerning the fine edge between a brilliant thought and a crazy one today is nearly impossible as rational Mercury trines wild Uranus. However, there's really no need to waste too much time worrying about slipping over the edge as long as you maintain your sense of humor. Keep your feet on solid ground; remember, it's not necessary to share every amazing idea that crosses your mind. Knowing when to remain silent now could be your key to gaining more credibility and power in the long run."
cancer,2015-12-01,"Burying your unrealistic thoughts won't make you happy today, but neither will indiscriminately telling them to anyone who will listen. Nevertheless, your outrageous schemes may get the best of you if you cannot come up with a plan to harness the power of your imagination. Instead of allowing your dreams to drift aimlessly, discuss your dilemma with a clever confidant; letting a friend in on your creative process can help you integrate an otherworldly vision into your everyday life."
leo,2015-12-01,"Big bold action may be necessary for you to find emotional satisfaction today as the Moon dances her way through dramatic Leo. Luckily, you are primed for a stellar performance even if you're concerned about other parts of your life. Instead of pretending that everything is fine now, set aside your defenses and just share your story with someone you trust. Although the show must go on, you can ensure it's of the highest caliber if you take off your mask and act from your heart."
virgo,2015-12-01,"There are many disparate facets of your life coming together now, and you would be wise to connect the dots between the apparent coincidences. You have a chance to create a special kind of magic simply by focusing on the relationship between separate events. Analytical Mercury is busy filling your head with one idea after another today. But rather than trying to rationally explain every thought, just find a way to weave the strands into a single tapestry. A picture is worth a thousand words."
libra,2015-12-01,"Your best friends remain true to you through thick and thin, and they quietly cheer you on as you express your creativity today. They seem to appreciate your authenticity and admire you even more when you are doing what you love. Thankfully, you enjoy shining for others, so this can be a fantastic win-win situation. Stretch into new territory by using your colorful imagination to create a special memory for everyone; your talent knows no bounds."
scorpio,2015-12-01,"Circumstances may necessitate that you publicly display your emotions in ways that normally would make you uncomfortable. Nevertheless, you are willing to stand up for your beliefs today, and being vulnerable is just part of the package. Nevertheless, wait until you are fully ready before making a serious commitment. Remember, it's healthier for your soul to connect your passion with a social cause beyond your individual needs. Carl Sagan wrote, ""For small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love."""
sagittarius,2015-12-01,"You wish you were free of obligations so you could explore new paths into your future. Unfortunately, you might have responsibilities you cannot avoid today. Luckily, falling behind isn't as bad as it sounds, since handling unfinished business doesn't prevent you from also chasing your dreams. Even if you're not prepared to embark on your next great adventure, tying up loose ends now allows you to fly sooner than you expect."
capricorn,2015-12-01,"Attempting to balance your list of chores with your desire for excitement leads to an unsolvable dilemma today. Even if you're facing a difficult decision now, you're required to play by the existing rules. Thankfully, changing your attitude can change the name of the game, enabling you to maintain your integrity while also breaking out of your shell. Never underestimate the element of surprise. Take a walk on the wild side and let your freak flag fly."
aquarius,2015-12-01,"It may seem as if everyone is having more fun than you today, but this lopsided perception could be a figment of your imagination. You want to be part of the group, yet you also need to maintain your reputation as an outsider. Instead of comparing yourself to anyone else, decide what you want to do now based only on what would make your heart happiest. Then take a few small yet determined steps to set you off in the right direction. Following your dreams is a noble cause which will earn you the admiration of others."
pisces,2015-12-01,"You might come across more rebellious than you actually feel today since you don't realize how intimidating your words sound to your coworkers. Obviously, you are free to say whatever enters your mind without censoring your remarks. Nevertheless, someone may not take your message as lightly as you intend. Happily, you can prevent discord by going out of your way to respect the opinions of others, even if they are vastly different from yours. Diversity can be found in the art of thinking independently together."
aries,2015-12-02,"You assume all will turn out well, even if the dynamics at work are in a state of flux. Your ability to maintain a positive attitude could be tested today when someone starts to throw shade on your best ideas. Others may even go so far as to accuse you of ignoring the interpersonal complexity of the present moment. Naturally, an optimistic outlook is a healthy one as long as you're not trying to avoid the truth. Leave your ego at the door and address the concerns of others with an open mind and an honest heart."
taurus,2015-12-02,"You may be looking at the exact same things you saw yesterday, but now you can imagine potential that wasn't previously there. Lovely Venus lights up your life by showing you the silver lining to every dark cloud. However, you could have such unrealistic expectations that you need to adjust your perspective today. Injecting a shot of reality into your thinking enables you to create middle ground. You will be free to get on with the work at hand once you clearly see both sides of the picture."
gemini,2015-12-02,"You swiftly lose track of the mundane world today as visions of distant horizons seem close enough to reach out and touch. You are ready to jump on your unicorn and fly off into the rainbow-filled sky, but you don't have a clue as to which way to go. Interdimensional travel is best done without maps; let your infamous curiosity take you on a memorable ride. Give yourself a few days for this mind-bending excursion. Allow your thoughts to gradually drift down to Earth before trying to make your dreams come true."
cancer,2015-12-02,"You could fool yourself into believing that you have all the support you need to accomplish your goals today. But working extra hard may not be sufficient to get the job done. To make matters worse, your coworkers might disappear when the heavy lifting begins. It's not that others are lazy; it's just that they can't visualize the possibilities you do now, so they remain unmotivated. Instead of attempting to convince everyone that they should join your cause, scale back your expectations for a day or two and then try again."
leo,2015-12-02,"You exude a special kind of love that goes beyond your personal needs and your judgments of others. You can see people's shortcomings now, but you're happy to accept them as part of the package. You're also temporarily willing to work with the understanding that your desires are not being fully addressed. Although the novelty may fade, the truth is more satisfying than a dream based upon an impossible fantasy."
virgo,2015-12-02,"Try to finish as much as you can today, whether or not you are wrestling with a non-negotiable deadline. The cosmic energy patterns shift tonight, and you might not be able to continue your work on the same trajectory as before. The real danger is complacency; if you think that everything will turn out fine then you aren't as motivated now to take immediate action. Don't drop the ball; sometimes being your own taskmaster is the best way to reach your goals."
libra,2015-12-02,"It's time to reveal your dreams to those around you especially if you've recently been absent, wandering around lost in your fantasies. This disclosure might seem like a risk, but keeping things to yourself will only lead to further isolation. At least, if you tell others what you need now, you are giving them a chance to deliver the goods. But there's still a strong possibility that you won't be satisfied with what you receive today. Nevertheless, learning to be grateful for life's little blessings is a gift in itself."
scorpio,2015-12-02,"You might act as if you're at peace with whatever happens now. However, the truth is that your attractions are pulling you strongly in two opposing directions and you don't want to let go of either choice. Unfortunately, it's time to stop living under the illusion that you can follow divergent paths for much longer. You are at a fork in the road and you must make a final decision before moving forward. Calibrate your compass, say a little prayer, and trust your intuition to lead you down the right path."
sagittarius,2015-12-02,"You appear to have an extra dose of charm working in your favor today as flirtatious Venus hypnotizes loquacious Mercury in your sign. Although you might not feel any different now, people see you glowing  in a more captivating light. The cosmos is offering you a window of opportunity, whether you use it or not is up to you. But don't push your luck too far; instant karma will get you if you overstep your boundaries. Love is best given when nothing is expected in return."
capricorn,2015-12-02,"You may be required to take charge at work today, even if you're not the boss. It's just that you can spot what needs to be done and, thankfully, everyone trusts your judgment. Don't let your power go to your head. Even if you must reject someone's impractical idea or cut people from your project, listen to the advice of others before making your final decision. Careful considerations, not impulsive actions, will ensure your success without compromising your integrity."
aquarius,2015-12-02,"Although you've encountered resistance in your path recently, your true friends are finally riding to your rescue. Thankfully, their support arrives in the nick of time because you might seriously consider quitting today. You can still envision all the possibilities, but you just don't know if your well of energy is deep enough to sustain your efforts for much longer. At least, give your peeps a chance to change your mind before walking away. Their confidence in you acts as an elixir for your weary heart, leaving you refreshed and ready to take on the world."
pisces,2015-12-02,"Your dwindling resources make it nearly impossible to start a new relationship or project now. A lack of time complicates scheduling activities with a friend or potential partner. Meanwhile, finances can also play into the equation since it's harder to justify an extravagance if you don't have enough cash to cover your basic expenses. The rewards are priceless if you can learn how to get by on less. Paradoxically, it's your belief in the ultimate abundance of the universe that will bring prosperity into your life."
aries,2015-12-03,"You're tempted to inflate every trivial incident into a major event today. You think you are acting in a practical manner, even if you visualize unlimited potential everywhere you go. As mystic William Blake wrote, you can ""see infinity in a grain of sand."" However, reaching for the Moon doesn't mean that it's within your grasp. Nevertheless, extending yourself beyond your limits creates opportunities that can lead to a more fulfilling life."
taurus,2015-12-03,"No matter how motivated you are to finish what you start today, you might not be able to refuse an offer that sounds like music to your ears. But, thankfully, employing calculated logic enables you to maintain a bit of distance between you and someone who is pushing an ambitious agenda. Nevertheless, there's no need to withdraw completely; just stay aware of your priorities. There are consequences if you leave your work undone. Managing your time wisely allows you to wander off course while still maintaining your solid reputation."
gemini,2015-12-03,"It's as if you're riding on a mental tilt-a-whirl today and it can be tricky to keep your bearings. Surfing a wave of enthusiasm is fun, especially now that the Moon and Mercury are dancing with indulgent Jupiter. Nevertheless, there is also serious business that demands your attention. Fortunately, your analytical powers are strong as long as you remember to balance pleasure with practicality. But don't take any shortcuts; following the rules will pay off in the long run."
cancer,2015-12-03,"Your frustration builds if your emotions aren't in sync with your experiences today. Unfortunately, your impatience provokes you to justify reckless actions. Exuding self-confidence is one way to hide your concerns, but if you're not careful you might take this tactic too far. You could land in a pile of trouble if your actions are fueled by unsubstantiated facts. Thankfully, taking the time to double-check your logic may be enough to put everything back in perspective. A little objectivity saves the day."
leo,2015-12-03,"Your current predicament stems from needing to maintain a healthy balance between decisive action and cautious planning. Thankfully, your organizational skills are operating efficiently today, enabling you to process an extraordinary amount of information. Nevertheless, you still may attempt a risky strategy unless you heed the practical constraints on your time and energy. You will shine like the star you are if you exercise self-discipline before committing to more than you can deliver."
virgo,2015-12-03,"People see your enthusiasm bubbling over today, even if you are trying to show more self-restraint. But the Moon's approach to bombastic Jupiter in your 1st House of Personality could make you overly chatty. Don't squander your mental resources; using words sparingly gives them extra impact. Unfortunately, endlessly rambling on about your latest and greatest idea does not further your cause. A little less talk and a lot more action leaves the best impression."
libra,2015-12-03,"You're clear about your current responsibilities, but you don't necessarily want to fulfill your obligations today. Part of your problem is that you might think everything should be easier than it is now. But looking for a quick fix is a waste of time; the only way to reach your goal is by taking the tried and truth path. Rather than dreaming about your future or reminiscing over your past, follow through on your good intentions today."
scorpio,2015-12-03,"Steer clear of political or philosophical debates today because you could end up arguing only with yourself. Oddly enough, it might be difficult to tell which side you are on now. You're probably not vacillating on the issues; it's just that you are acutely aware there is more than one sensible solution to a lingering problem. Continue to gather facts and develop your ideas while waiting for your mental pendulum to come to a rest. Take a deep breath; the sense of urgency you feel is yours alone."
sagittarius,2015-12-03,"Your schedule is so packed today that you might not know where to start. Nevertheless, you need to jump in and get to work so others know you are holding up your end of the bargain. However, you could make your life more complicated by taking on too much while the Moon parties with excessive Jupiter in your 10th House of Public Status. Move through your day one step at a time, instead of being distracted by sparkly lights off in the distance. Managing what's right in front of your nose is more productive now than planning for the future."
capricorn,2015-12-03,"You are often seen as the champion of productivity because you can maintain a steady perspective under pressure. Normally, you strategically calculate what needs to be done to achieve your goals and then set your mind to doing it. However, your reality filter may be a bit wonky today as everything seems to have an inflated potential, making it wise to avoid spontaneous decisions. You've worked too long and too hard to risk throwing it all away over a fleeting fantasy. Don't let a momentary lapse of judgment unnecessarily hijack your dreams."
aquarius,2015-12-03,"You could set a coworker up for disappointment today if you don't establish clear limits on how much you are willing to help. Your current optimism tempts you to agree to almost anything just to sidestep an awkward conversation. Unfortunately, this kind of logic won't solve any problems. Express your concerns instead of looking for an easy way out. The real answers might not be the most rational ones now because they come from your heart and not from your head."
pisces,2015-12-03,"Everyone seems to have the perfect solution to your current career dilemma. You are in the process of establishing new priorities and may be struggling to set realistic goals. You are grateful that your friends and coworkers believe in your talents and encourage you to expand your thinking. Nevertheless, you don't want to court disaster by falling short of lofty objectives. Take the advice of others into consideration today, but ultimately, the only person you need to answer to is yourself."
aries,2015-12-04,"Big ideas at work aren't enough to ensure your success today, because once you make a plan you still have to execute it in a timely manner. Ironically, you must trust your intuition now rather than sticking to the dry facts when circumstances dictate a strategic change. But don't just give up when the going gets tough. Talking about a struggle as it unfolds helps you figure out what to do next as long as you share your story with a trustworthy ally who will tell you the unvarnished truth."
taurus,2015-12-04,"You no longer want to do things at work in the same old way. In fact, you may be obsessed with finding a better approach to any project now. Unfortunately, your coworkers and friends might not be so eager to support your rebellious nature. Although the idea of collaborating with others sounds ideal, you need to experiment on your own today. The exhilaration you experience from achieving your goal makes doing it alone worthwhile. Self-sufficiency offers you the freedom to do as you wish."
gemini,2015-12-04,"You may be so bored with your work routine that you want to check out for the weekend before the whistle blows. Unfortunately, you might have to stick around until the end of the day, even if you've already escaped to somewhere better in your mind. Thankfully, you can overcome your impatience by adopting a creative approach to meeting your responsibilities. Use your imagination to make your job more fun, instead of just wishing you were someplace else. Your unwillingness to settle for less is your greatest asset now if you keep your priorities straight."
cancer,2015-12-04,"Your friends are counting on you to show up and be the life of the party. Although you might prefer starting the weekend early, you must buckle down and finish your work before earning your independence. Ironically, by the time your day is done, you may just want to go home to unwind instead of heading out for a night on the town. Don't let anyone talk you into something you don't feel like doing now; you're entitled to spend your evening anyway you wish."
leo,2015-12-04,"You might begin the day with an unrealistic assessment of how much you can accomplish. However, your ambitious approach to your chores shifts as the changeable Moon moves into your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Don't worry about sticking to your previous plans. Choose excitement over routine to squeeze the most out of the present moment. Seize the day before it fades into the past."
virgo,2015-12-04,"Concentrating on your work is challenging this morning, making it impossible to finish anything you start. Fortunately, your mind sharpens as the day wears on, enabling you to successfully revisit a mentally daunting task. If your thoughts wander to greener pastures, gently remind yourself of your immediate goal. Dogged persistence is the key to getting the job done; keep your shoulder to the wheel until your chores are complete and your stellar reputation shines."
libra,2015-12-04,"You aren't satisfied with the status quo today and might be especially motivated to learn a new skill. The Moon's entry into your sign today shifts your focus from the rational world toward a more subjective perspective. Perhaps it's time to take up an intriguing course of study that satisfies a deepening curiosity in some unexplored area of art, psychology or metaphysics. Sometimes life is truly a beautiful mystery just waiting to be discovered."
scorpio,2015-12-04,"This is the perfect day to do some serious research if you believe you are missing a significant piece of information about money matters. Messenger Mercury squares inflationary Jupiter, indicating the heightened importance of communication. However, you could waste valuable time by following the wrong critter down a rabbit hole. Luckily, asking the right questions now should bring clear answers to your lingering doubts. Leave no stone unturned in your search for the truth."
sagittarius,2015-12-04,"You may be unsure of your current destination, but oddly enough your confusion won't stop you from continuing on a road to somewhere. Even if you begin without the luxury of a map, you will learn more about where you're heading as the day progresses. Trusting your intuition takes courage, especially now that your conclusions aren't supported by the obvious facts. Blazing your own trail is a more successful strategy now than following a path that is already well-worn by others."
capricorn,2015-12-04,"Setting lofty goals is a crucial component of ambition, but harboring unrealistic hopes can turn your day sour. An enthusiastic approach to your career motivates you to reach beyond your limits while logical Mercury aligns with excessive Jupiter. Thankfully, the Moon's shift into your 10th House of Social Responsibility brings an energetic boost, but it may be too little and too late. Simply acknowledging the circumstances that are out of your control minimizes your frustration and maximizes your productivity."
aquarius,2015-12-04,"Keeping your feet on the ground seems like a Herculean task today, even if you have very practical goals in mind. Hopefully, you can fulfill most of your obligations prior to softening your focus because you won't want to look back once you cut yourself loose from the ties of responsibility. There's nothing wrong with pursuing the excitement of an adrenaline rush as long as your work doesn't suffer in the process. Following your dreams is best when your conscience is clear."
pisces,2015-12-04,"Tending to your work-related duties may be a real struggle today because your imagination is running rampant. Instead of being content with perceiving things as they are, envision them in your mind's eye as you wish them to be. The power of your intention is so strong now that you can manifest nearly anything you believe to be true. However, reality won't necessarily support your fantasies unless you reinforce them with practical plans that produce tangible results."
aries,2015-12-05,"Your emotions burn hotter today with vulnerable Venus steaming up your 8th House of Intimacy, possibly making you slightly uncomfortable. It's not that you are unwilling to express your feelings; it's just the excessive intensity can overwhelm your agenda and pull you off track. This heart-centered planetary emphasis is signaling you to slow down and sink deeper into the dance. As the scientist Galileo wrote, ""Passion is the genesis of genius."""
taurus,2015-12-05,"Issues regarding matters of the heart may be a recurring topic of discussion now, even if the subject isn't light and easy. You grow more concerned with your most intimate relationships while loving Venus is sauntering through your 7th House of Others. You have little choice; it's time to delve into your subconscious so you can better handle the uncertainty of your changing feelings. Fortunately, opportunity is often delivered in the midst of confusion."
gemini,2015-12-05,"Although you're eager to pursue your share of lighthearted fun, additional needs are beginning to surface today. Your intuition is telling you to spend more time twirling around right where you are now, rather than tap dancing all over the place. Don't worry; you still can find plenty of enjoyment without completely changing your tune. Just be certain your fancy footwork is connected to your heart and not just your head. The music of love will lead you in the right direction."
cancer,2015-12-05,"You respond favorably to the intensity of the emotional connections you make today. It seems as if the cosmos is resonating with your psyche now that sweet Venus is sparkling in your 5th House of Romance. But you are not interested in settling for anything less than you need, even if you want more than anyone else is able to give now. Transforming your love life is possible if you're willing to dance with this paradox. Although you might not create relationship magic immediately, there's no urgency to solve this dilemma right away. Patience may be bitter, but its fruit is sweet."
leo,2015-12-05,"Your emotional needs may be more passionate than anyone realizes, especially if you hide your feelings when you are frustrated. Fortunately, you seem to fully appreciate your blessings today, but deeper down you hear your desires speaking from the recesses of your heart. Listen carefully to your inner voice because it can magically lead you to the happiness you seek. To quote Mahatma Gandhi, ""Where there is love there is life."""
virgo,2015-12-05,"Something could be bothering you today, even if you are busy indulging in the pleasures of life. Although your current malaise may not be strong enough to motivate initiating any significant changes, you still need to handle a surge of passion that has nowhere to go. Don't force resolution; delaying emotional decisions for a few days might be prudent. It's not easy to simply drop your guard on command. Honest communication requires radical trust from all parties involved."
libra,2015-12-05,"You are more socially aware than others because you inherently understand the balance needed for harmonious relationships. However, your patience wears thin today as Venus puts you in touch with your own non-negotiable needs. Even if your strong desires are irrepressible, rely on your logical analysis over irrational intuition for the next few days. Sometimes it's necessary to place your feelings on hold while you take care of the practical demands of the day."
scorpio,2015-12-05,"Honestly expressing your desires demands your full concentration today. Thankfully, you can make excellent use of charming Venus as she graces your emotionally charged sign, softening the sharp edges of your passions. Maintaining a healthy balance in relationships is easier than ever as long as you think about your delivery before putting your feelings on the line. Opening your heart sets off cosmic ripples that will transform your life."
sagittarius,2015-12-05,"Your romantic inclinations begin to turn spiritual as you adopt a more altruistic orientation. Your longings extend beyond rational walls now, and it's best not to restrain them in a materialistic box while lovely Venus hangs out in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness. The emotional payoff could be well worth taking a risk, not that you need much encouragement in that department. Think of it as a metaphysical adventure and follow your instincts; your heart knows things your mind can't explain."
capricorn,2015-12-05,"You may feel pressured to go along with the changing dynamics of an evolving relationship now. But you grow more anxious when you start to realize how much is actually beyond your control. Letting go of your agenda is easy if you are secure in your own world. But you could overreact out of fear today, attempting to keep your social calendar from falling apart. Thankfully, there's no reason to fret once you adjust your expectations. Too many assumptions can steal the joy of the moment."
aquarius,2015-12-05,"Receiving accolades for your work makes you feel extremely proud of your recent efforts. Nevertheless, you might still be left hungering for more recognition and support today. Ultimately, success has less to do with the judgment of others than your own sense of accomplishment. There's no need to be dependent on anyone else's approval now if your contribution to the greater good comes from your heart. It's okay to give yourself a pat on the back when you deserve it."
pisces,2015-12-05,"The fog is lifting and you find yourself standing out in the crystal clear sunlight of awareness. Your vision of the future is unobstructed now and you can see your destination in the distance. Unfortunately, not everything ahead is as stress free as you wish. You can't help but notice the uphill battle that's still between you and the lovely horizon. The good news is that it's always better to base decisions on the facts and not on illusions. Dreams don't come true unless you do the work."
aries,2015-12-06,"You are in no mood to be challenged today and may react defensively, even if you are not the target of someone's resistance. A lingering issue could push you dangerously close to an emotional meltdown. You can feel the heat rising from the bottom of the volcano and are driven to express your unresolved issues. Nevertheless, it works in your favor if you make your point in a constructive manner. Being sensitive to everyone else's feelings allows you to deliver your message in a way that is well received."
taurus,2015-12-06,"Your desire to stick to your routine today might create unnecessary tension, even if you truly believe your actions are justifiable. Obstinately hiding behind a wall without expressing your feelings can lead to resentment on all fronts. The current emotional waves may be intense, but surfing them is healthier than trying to hold back the tide. If initiating an honest dialogue doesn't heal the conflict, let the energy settle down a bit instead of trying the same defensive tactics again and again. A peaceful warrior knows when to advance and when to retreat."
gemini,2015-12-06,"Although everything might seem like a struggle today, don't let your fear prevent you from doing what you know is right. You may be worried about the changing dynamics of a relationship because you are being pressured by events that you can't control. You could be tempted to sidestep a potentially uncomfortable encounter, but it's wiser to face the music while it's still playing. Honor your truth no matter what; the easy way out does not ultimately take you where you want to go."
cancer,2015-12-06,"You can navigate through the challenges of the day with flying colors if you maintain your integrity and remember to treat everyone with respect and kindness. However, if you are holding onto an old grudge, any interaction might unexpectedly explode into an emotional confrontation. Ironically, your fear of losing control could be the catalyst that drags you into a melodramatic standoff. The key is not to get hooked by someone else's issues today. Choosing the high road enables you to avoid additional complications and paves the way to peace."
leo,2015-12-06,"Although a person, place or thing looked promising in the past, there is information coming to light now that could drastically change your opinion. Conflicts arise because your agenda is set in stone and you are driven to manifest your dreams. However, your ambitions seem to have a life of their own. Consider preemptively tempering your goals for the sake of harmony. Exercising a little flexibility today makes your life much easier in the present moment, and possibly even for weeks to come."
virgo,2015-12-06,"Someone is undermining your efforts today and the situation is so complex that it could weigh heavy on your mind. One obvious tactic is to analyze what you may have done to arouse such opposition. Much to your chagrin, it might be necessary to confront others about their behavior. However, it's to your advantage to alter your own course of action, too. You are blessed with an opportunity to resolve your emotional issues now; if you don't, the circumstantial resistance will just pop up again at a less convenient time. Stepping up to the challenge demonstrates your strength of character; trust your conscience to know what is right."
libra,2015-12-06,"A close friend or relative may be on your case today. You realize that a rapid response is necessary, but you're flummoxed as to how best to proceed. Talking about your various choices won't help you get what you want now, but a serious conversation could still be useful as long as you don't stop at idle conversation. You must be willing to fight for your convictions. Don't wait for the other shoe to drop before you do anything; take the initiative and run with it while you can."
scorpio,2015-12-06,"You're so supercharged with emotions that sometimes they can be more than you want to handle. Your two planetary rulers, warrior Mars and unrelenting Pluto, are dynamically squaring off in a cosmic battle of wills, cranking up your passions to record heights. Even if you manage to turn down the volume on your feelings during the day, you still must deal with them in the dark quiet of the night. If you happen to be at odds with someone, don't push the conflict too far. A fight to the finish will leave no winners. Take an experimental approach and channel your energy into something wildly constructive, instead."
sagittarius,2015-12-06,"Don't expect to get any rest and relaxation today. In fact, you can accomplish much more than you realize if you set your mind on a specific goal. Nevertheless, you still might encounter strong resistance from others who question your motives. You may be willing to do anything to prove your competence, so be careful not to exhaust yourself now by trying to achieve the impossible. Even if people are impressed with your positive attitude, you're better off saving some energy for the days ahead. Ultimately, your good intentions will shine through if your heart is in the right place."
capricorn,2015-12-06,"You're given a rare opportunity to conquer your fears now, especially if you're willing to re-experience the pain of an old emotional wound. Your natural tendency is to avoid the full power of your feelings by shifting the spotlight onto outer accomplishments, instead. But it's not about making a splash in the real world today; gratefully accept this cosmic gift by focusing on the spiritual transformation that can greatly improve your existence on this planet."
aquarius,2015-12-06,"It might appear as if you're engaging in a battle with your family and friends today, rather than working or playing with them. Although the circumstances may feel extreme, things are not really that black or white. Unfortunately, gray middle ground is difficult to find now because you're so close to the problem, but still can't fix it. Don't lose your sharp perspective, but relinquish your assumptions about the solution. The more flexibility you can demonstrate when interacting with others, the sooner the tension will pass. Hold onto your sense of humor and don't let go."
pisces,2015-12-06,"Your involvement in a surprising emotional showdown today could add unwanted turmoil to your life. Although it may seem as if the problem originates with others, at least half of this conflict is contained within the confines of your own mind. You can aim the dynamics toward a peaceful resolution by simply taking your fair share of the responsibility for the current unstable situation. Change yourself before attempting to change anyone else."
aries,2015-12-07,"You want to squeeze as much out of life now as you possibly can, and are willing to do whatever is necessary to maximize your experiences. Thankfully, your perceptions are razor sharp and you manage your time with great finesse today. But don't waste precious energy talking about your plans. The early bird gets the worm, so figure out which adventure is calling your name the loudest and quickly answer with a resounding yes."
taurus,2015-12-07,"You're not sure why everyone makes the simplest tasks so complicated today. It's much easier for you to function effectively when you can singularly focus on your work, prompting you to avoid unnecessary emotional drama. You might not have much to add to the conversation, but playing the strong-and-silent type doesn't work in your favor now. Without judgment or malice, kindly explain why you need to withdraw from the noise of the crowd. Taking the time for respectful communication minimizes the odds of offending anyone and gives you the best chance of establishing peace and quiet."
gemini,2015-12-07,"You possess the power to take charge of a situation today, even if everything seems to be running amok. It's not only that your words carry extra weight now; you can also immediately grasp the current complexities, formulate a viable plan and persuade others to do their part. Fortunately, adopting a practical approach enables your coworkers to trust your intentions. Although finishing a job is important, don't close your creativity off from the magic of your imagination. Your dreams often produce your greatest insights."
cancer,2015-12-07,"You might be a happier camper if only you could stay at home and turn off the phone today, but you'll feel more like yourself once you get out in the fresh air. In fact, you could be highly productive now if you temporarily set aside your desire for solitude. Don't worry; you can sneak in a bit of private time this evening to indulge in your fantasies. Taking care of business first enables you to cozy into your nest with a true sense of accomplishment later on."
leo,2015-12-07,"Set aside your childish ways and take yourself more seriously today. You might not have your feet as firmly planted on the ground tomorrow, so focus on practical matters while you have the chance. Set attainable goals and then channel all of your energy toward achieving them. Encountering uncertainty doesn't mean you're on the wrong track now; you just need to have enough faith in your skills to get you over this hump. Your sheer determination is the secret to your success."
virgo,2015-12-07,"Although you may have many things to do now, it's crucial to set clear priorities and eliminate all but the most essential tasks. Thankfully, you are well-equipped to cut through the fuzzy dreams, sort through the noise and hone in on the critical pieces of the puzzle. Fortunately, there's no urgency to complete everything today; you only need to decide what's most important and the rest will easily fall into place. Discernment is your friend in times of chaos and confusion."
libra,2015-12-07,"You might have stepped out of line recently or had to deal with someone who let you down. Either way, you must find the inspiration to put things back together today, with or without help from anyone else. You're not interested in achieving lofty goals now; accomplishing something that has an immediate impact on your life is more gratifying. It's better to hold your ground than idly dreaming about a destination that's totally out of reach. Establish sensible limits and your game plan can't fail."
scorpio,2015-12-07,"You wish everyone would just leave you to your own devices today, unless they have something constructive to offer that's pertinent to your current activities. However, you probably won't take the time to inform anyone of your plans because you're afraid to disperse your energy. Luckily, your attraction to your unexpressed dreams and your powerful intention to realize them is an unbeatable combination now. Choosing your goals wisely is your first step to lasting satisfaction."
sagittarius,2015-12-07,"A well-intended colleague may ask you what's wrong today because it seems as if you are acting out of character. Although you might not express the effusive warmth that people often expect from you, it's only because you're preoccupied with important matters now. Thankfully, you have enough sense to realize there is a narrow margin for error and your disinterest in trivial pursuits stems from your desire to give your very best performance. Perfection is both a blessing and a curse; the sooner you accept you're only human, the better."
capricorn,2015-12-07,"Your peers are perceptive enough to look right past your smile today because they can tell something's bothering you. Although you might attempt to give off a casual air at first, you begin to realize how much effort is required to sustain your cheerful facade. Fortunately, your logical thinking enables you to understand that others don't necessarily share your ambitions. Everyone can draw different conclusions from the same data. Honoring each individual perspective as valid is the only way to keep the peace."
aquarius,2015-12-07,"You attempt to steer clear of abstract thinking today, but keep getting pulled back into your orbit of dreams. Normally, you like to push the edges of the intellectual envelope, but you could take it too far now. Rather than becoming lost in fantastic concepts and unrealistic visions, bring every idea into sharp focus with the question, ""How can this be applied in the present moment?"" Don't worry about what anyone thinks of your unconventional methods; time will likely prove you right if you keep things real."
pisces,2015-12-07,"You're looking forward to stealing some time away from work to pursue an amazing adventure. Nevertheless, your impatience can get the best of you now because you have responsibilities to fulfill before you're allowed to escape. Embracing the order of things graciously makes the difference between happiness and frustration. Your methodical approach to your work early in the day all but guarantees that you'll be able to thoroughly enjoy your metaphysical exploits later on."
aries,2015-12-08,"One too many options today complicate your efforts to decide what to do first. You may be daydreaming about things that you don't normally let yourself imagine. Your nerves are on edge, waiting for the next thrilling experience to land in your lap. Nevertheless, don't attempt to tame this wild energy or you might explode. Find a healthy channel of expression that utilizes your adrenaline, such as physical exertion. Instead of trying to bottle this cosmic electricity for later, run with it for all it's worth."
taurus,2015-12-08,"You typically trust your senses more than your feelings, but your current emotions could overwhelm your rational thoughts. Your energy is tightly wired today and your jumpiness may set you off if you try to hold still. Occasionally, your cage benefits from being rattled -- especially when your relationships have grown too rigid. Nevertheless, don't wait for something unexpected to happen. Instead, stretch beyond your comfort zone and be more flexible in both body and mind."
gemini,2015-12-08,"Flirting with an emotional turning point gives you a total adrenaline rush today. You are looking for action and may be drawn toward the freedom of adventure. You are up for almost anything, but your current enthusiasm doesn't mean that it's okay to pursue every passing fancy. Your playful charm could attract someone who is different from your usual preference. The danger is only in how quickly and unconsciously you respond to your own triggers. Obviously, weighing the risks against the rewards slows your progress down a bit, but sorting it all out leads to wiser choices and happier endings."
cancer,2015-12-08,"It's a rare day when you're completely unconcerned about staying safe within your protective shell. But happily, you feel grounded enough now to step outside your own castle for a breath of fresh air. If you are suppressing your needs, this might be an opportune time to finally bring them out into the open. Although others may be caught off guard at first by your personal disclosure, ultimately they'll appreciate your spirit of authenticity and embrace you with open arms."
leo,2015-12-08,"You can get away with unorthodox behavior today without creating too much of a stir. It feels like the cosmos has granted you special permission to be weird and unpredictable. However, you might take your rebellious attitude too far if you believe you're being misunderstood. Rather than explaining your intentions, you could blow a gasket because you don't want to blindly accept the status quo. Fortunately, you can shine your light as brightly as you wish now as long as you take a few moments to consider the consequences of your actions."
virgo,2015-12-08,"You may grow anxious from an endless stream of erratic and eclectic thoughts today, especially if you don't have the calming perspective of immediate feedback from a trusted friend. Normally, your common sense prevails when issues of the heart are on the table; nevertheless, you might be a bit hot under the collar now. Ignoring your emotions sounds like a good idea, but your desires won't quiet down until you acknowledge them. Expressing your feelings through artistic pursuits enables you to fully engage the process without creating additional drama."
libra,2015-12-08,"Expressing yourself in a radically different manner becomes your top priority today. Although you might be conservative in your taste, you're still tempted to flirt with the edge now. You feel the need to make a bold statement to prevent others from putting you into a nice and tidy box. Your actions may surprise people who think they know you well, but don't let their reactions stifle your creativity. You often take your cues from someone else's direction, but it's time to throw all the old scripts away. Dance with the unknown and make it up as you go along."
scorpio,2015-12-08,"An unscheduled emotional meltdown could clear the air today. The good news is just as the thunder begins to rumble, the skies open up, freeing you from your mundane worries. Nevertheless, your desires are still a bit erratic as you are simultaneously drawn toward attachment and independence. A relationship that gives you the freedom to express whatever you feel is ideal. However, you can create more trouble than it's worth if you act on every whim that crosses your mind. Finding a happy medium between being naughty and nice is the trick to your satisfaction."
sagittarius,2015-12-08,"Sinking into the depths of your feelings may be necessary to release a negative charge that has turned into an unhealthy anchor. You might assume you can just cut an emotional tie that binds you and be free of it once and for all -- but it's never quite that simple. This unconventional strategy isn't about making a quick escape; instead, seek ways to add more passion into your life. Fortunately, you receive cosmic inspiration today from irrepressible Uranus as it invites you to explore life's mysteries. Spontaneous expression is your friend."
capricorn,2015-12-08,"You are standing at the edge of something big. Your natural response as a steadfast Goat is to err on the side of caution and back up to prevent an accidental fall. Although you wouldn't normally jump off a cliff, your inner cheerleader encourages you to throw caution to the wind now and fly. Believe it or not, it's safer than you think; take a leap of faith and push off into the unknown without looking back."
aquarius,2015-12-08,"A sudden shift of energy could change your social standing today when the radiant Sun beams its rays on your key planet Uranus. New connections create circumstances that revitalize your network of friends and associates. It's easy to get swept up in a wave of excitement and find yourself in over your head. Although your intuition is on fire now, don't ignore your common sense. All will turn out well if you remember to consider the potential rewards and losses before taking a calculated risk."
pisces,2015-12-08,"Your struggle for financial independence may grow into an annoying source of confusion now. The planets motivate you to put your imagination to work while developing new career objectives, but being hooked by a particular goal doesn't mean it is the most sensible direction. Keep in mind that you feel more inspired when you follow your heart. Integrating your long-term aspirations into your life will take time, but it's best to start the ball rolling as soon as possible."
aries,2015-12-09,"Obviously, you know that getting angry for no apparent reason is unproductive. Unfortunately, you can't always prevent your emotions from impacting your life by simply hiding them. Although burying your negativity might postpone a difficult interaction, denial makes matters worse in the long run. In the final analysis, it's best to acknowledge your feelings and bring them out into the open. Keep in mind that your compassionate attitude may be more important than the words you use to share your truth."
taurus,2015-12-09,"You wish your coworkers would support your ideas, but they don't understand your true intentions. You may be annoyed by your unsuccessful attempts to explain your motives, especially if an authority figure shuts you down before you get a chance to say anything. Unfortunately, an act of rebellion is a waste of time and energy now, since you probably won't overcome the external resistance overnight. Choose your battles wisely and don't resist the inevitable. Believe it or not, time is on your side."
gemini,2015-12-09,"People seem to crawl out of the woodwork today, anxious to share their plans for the future with you. Thankfully, most of them could be rather inspirational as the forward-thinking Sagittarius Sun illuminates your 7th House of Relationships. You can benefit greatly from your interactions with anyone who encourages you with their big ideas and emboldens you with their confidence. Nevertheless, you possess the power to turn the tables and act in a magnanimous manner in someone else's life. Be the catalyst you seek."
cancer,2015-12-09,"You excel when you're in charge today, even if you're operating on blind faith for a while. Unfortunately, the best situation can grow awkward  if you just pretend that everything is okay. Instead of covering up your uncertainty with foolish behavior, just be honest and let everyone know exactly where you stand. Thankfully, this straightforward strategy takes very little effort on your part now. The best leaders lead from their hearts."
leo,2015-12-09,"You're on the rebound now as new possibilities for fun and games pop up in your life. You might have struggled with maintaining your spirits recently, but the skies are brighter and the horizons are clearer today. Nevertheless, complications still lurk in the shadows and you may grow discouraged if your plans run amok. Ignoring reality only delays the inevitable. However, shining the light of your awareness into the darkness exposes negativity and transforms it into something positive. Life is what you make it."
virgo,2015-12-09,"You have a clear handle on what you must do today, but it's no simple matter to concentrate when your mind is wandering all over the place. Ignoring an intriguing person is impossible, even if you should focus on your work. Luckily, being aware of your feelings doesn't require you to act on them right away. However, your unacknowledged desires will just continue to resurface until you give them their just due. Integrating your emotions is less stressful than inadvertently empowering them to rule your life."
libra,2015-12-09,"You don't often commit to more than you can deliver, but you may say yes today when you should say no. Your irrational optimism might stir up a hornet's nest of trouble now, but you can dream up more escape routes than you need. Nevertheless, it's unwise to introduce too much freedom into your life all at once, or you will grow nervous with the number of choices. In the long run, practicing self-discipline is easier than having reality put you in your place."
scorpio,2015-12-09,"It might seem as if your emotional lights dim when the Moon leaves your sign this afternoon. However, there's no need to replace the passion with anything else if you experience a sense of emptiness now. You're not automatically required to take charge of the situation if your workmates are unreliable today. Nevertheless, you can choose to adapt to the changing circumstances, enabling you to handle the responsibility that falls in your lap. Saving the day looks good on your resume."
sagittarius,2015-12-09,"Your feelings may be hurt today as unkind words are thrown at you by someone who's trying to manipulate your loyalties. Normally, you would laugh, let this negativity go and move on. However, the Moon's return to your sign heightens your sensitivity, inspiring you to respond with sincerity even while maintaining a non-judgmental attitude. Meanwhile, Mercury shifts into cautious Capricorn tonight, teaching you an important lesson about the virtue of patience if you're willing to listen."
capricorn,2015-12-09,"Suppressing your artistic urges can be quite irritating today, and you grow increasingly unhappy if someone blocks your self-expression. You might even lash out if you think he or she is the source of your current creative stagnation. The problem is you could project your anger on the wrong person unless you thoroughly process your emotions. If you feel the shadows growing longer, consciously guide yourself out of the dark and back into the light."
aquarius,2015-12-09,"You could be bent out of shape by a series of meaningless social encounters since you're inexplicably drawn toward the center of the emotional volcano now. Paradoxically, digging into other people's hidden motivations can also become your own personal journey inward. But you'll miss an important piece of the puzzle today if you just intellectualize what you learn. Instead, let the process continue until your feelings reveal the truth you've been seeking all along. Sometimes the heart sees what is invisible to the eye."
pisces,2015-12-09,"Your workweek continues on its high-intensity path, revealing secrets from the shadowlands of your awareness. The adventurous Sagittarius Moon saunters into your 10th House of Career today, encouraging you to believe that no professional challenge is impossible. Although self-confidence can move mountains, unfounded optimism doesn't help at all. Do whatever is necessary to keep your feet on the ground. The stars are within reach if you're willing to keep it real."
aries,2015-12-10,"Encouraging someone to take direct action today may be your strategy to avoid initiating responsibility for your own behavior. You might attempt to downplay your power as you struggle with how your desire for independence impacts your need to be loved. An opposition from impulsive Mars to erratic Uranus could even create conflict in an otherwise stable relationship. Keep in mind that your sense of urgency may be greatly exaggerated, possibly leading you to overreact. Fortunately, you can make real progress if you build the future on positive intentions and mutual respect."
taurus,2015-12-10,"An upsetting breakdown of stability at work can be avoided if you continue to acknowledge the value of your common sense. No one is eager to confront difficult issues until it becomes absolutely necessary, but you can minimize trouble by maintaining your compose while addressing the problem before it erupts. Don't be afraid to start a discussion about a controversial topic. Resolving the current situation may require a bit of disruption just to grab everyone's attention. The squeaky wheel gets the grease."
gemini,2015-12-10,"None of your regular tricks seem to work today. You're usually clever enough to magically pull a solution right out of thin air. Much to your chagrin, every tactic you try now is met with an unexpected response. The uncertainty may be enough to foster self-doubt in your ability to communicate your message. Whatever you do, don't give up; your unrelenting persistence might pay off with success once you find an approach that reduces the tension."
cancer,2015-12-10,"Trusting your instincts might appear to the only way to stay on your path today. However, just because you intuitively know how to respond, this doesn't mean that every plan is practical enough to actually execute. In fact, your route to success may seem blocked no matter which way you turn. Don't worry if you're not comfortable enough to express your feelings at work. Office politics are complicated now, but your emotional self-restraint and clear communication prevent things from falling apart."
leo,2015-12-10,"Your plan may not unfold smoothly today, even if you took time to consider a variety of possible scenarios. You carefully practiced your lines and you know how to play your part better than anyone. Unfortunately, the plot seems to have changed and your memorized performance is no longer relevant. You might even feel as if the other players were given new scripts and no one bothered to tell you. Losing control of your feelings and acting like a diva only makes things worse. Let go of your preconceived agenda and adapt to the changing scenery as magnanimously as possible."
virgo,2015-12-10,"Your ability to logically analyze a complex situation is usually a source of great comfort; however, it just makes everything unbearable today. You see exactly what's wrong and, thankfully, you know what to do to fix it. Unfortunately, you're not the one in charge. The harder you work to stabilize the situation now, the crazier it becomes. The dynamics of a relationship may have to travel down a rough road before they are able to improve. It's the darkest part of night just before the dawn."
libra,2015-12-10,"You won't likely find the little pleasures in life today you peace-seeking Libras dream about. Making sense of an unstable relationship challenges your social and analytical skills. Forget about putting your world back into balance now; you will only grow more aggravated if you try. Concentrate on cooperating with others instead, and you might just sail through the day without encountering any rough water. Err on the side of love, and give peace a chance."
scorpio,2015-12-10,"Although you might cherish the idea of a romantic encounter, your need for self-determination is off the charts now. Paradoxically, you won't allow anyone to steer your car, even if you asked him or her to drive it. Logic doesn't apply to your current dilemma; you can't figure out the best course of action if you're conflicted over the choices. For now, just do what feels right in the moment without trying to focus on the distant destination just yet. Love doesn't operate on any timetable but its own."
sagittarius,2015-12-10,"The planetary excitement and cosmic tension affect nearly everyone today, yet you Archers seem to get away with pulling a few strings of your own bow. You can help someone work through a difficult situation while others only seem to make it worse. Thankfully, your advice has a powerful impact on people, but you'll be even more effective now if you refrain from pushing your needs onto anyone else. Listening with an open heart is your secret strategy for a successful hunt."
capricorn,2015-12-10,"No matter how much you prepare for an upcoming event, you might be better off throwing your agenda to the wind and starting all over. Thankfully, this radical approach isn't as overwhelming as it sounds. The real lesson of the day is about releasing hidden tensions and reestablishing lost integrity. Scrap your battle plan if necessary, but do not negotiate away your feelings of security. Your chances for healthy growth are greatest when you honor your own roots before reaching to the stars."
aquarius,2015-12-10,"People seem unreliable today, but nearly everything that's happening in the outer world is actually a projection of your own experiences. You might be anxious because you are stretched to a breaking point, without anywhere to go. Ironically, the only sensible solution is to shake up everything in your immediate environment even more by acting unpredictably. Don't resist the looming changes; be the protagonist instead of the victim."
pisces,2015-12-10,"An unexpected emotional encounter reactivates a long-standing difference in values that has increased the gulf between you and someone else. You're tempted to just throw your hands up in despair and walk away from a conflict, but it's much healthier in the long run to confront your fears instead of burying them. Your world is rapidly transforming and you must alter your basic assumptions about who you are and your place in the world. Show your courage by embracing change as the most direct path to reestablishing the stability you desire."
aries,2015-12-11,"Restlessly spinning your wheels does nothing to soothe your impatience today. You're ready to start a new project even if complications arise before you shift into second gear. The fiery Sagittarius New Moon invigorates your 9th House of Adventure, giving you the green light to go ahead. Unfortunately, demands on your time may prohibit you from making much progress now. Don't misinterpret the situation; a dense fog is not a reason to turn back. Put all your senses on alert and if it's safe, continue driving toward your goals. Confidence is your key to success."
taurus,2015-12-11,"You're drawn to explore unfamiliar issues that don't normally concern you. You grow excited about venturing into the mysteries of the mind, investigating new ideas as the philosophical Sagittarius New Moon conjures up intrigue in your 8th House of Transformation. Unfortunately, metaphysical interests pull you away from more practical concerns. However, you won't have to sacrifice real world efforts because you can simultaneously operate in both realms. Journeying to the most amazing places might not require going anywhere at all."
gemini,2015-12-11,"You imagine that people are expecting too much from you now. The cheerful Sagittarius New Moon rattles your 7th House of Partners, indicating your need to be seen in the most positive light by others. Seek ways to improve a significant relationship by taking it in a new direction; your willingness to become a better version of yourself initiates powerful personal growth. Delving deeper into your own psyche produces surprising results. Although it's tempting to scatter your energy, concentrate your attention on what matters most if you want to be taken seriously."
cancer,2015-12-11,"You believe you can eliminate old habits with a snap of your fingers. The truth is that wellness begins with acting on the simplest lifestyle decisions. The optimistic Sagittarius New Moon emphasizes your 6th House of Health, reminding you how easy it is to improve your diet by eliminating foods that offer empty calories with little nourishment value. In fact, just moderating your consumption of alcohol or sugar creates a positive difference. It's wiser to make small modifications that last rather than radically changing everything for a few days, only to have you settle back into a familiar routine as soon as you're given the chance."
leo,2015-12-11,"You might not be able to contain your energy today, especially if you're stuck at a desk in an office. Fortunately, you could ease your anxiety by participating in sports, even as an engaged spectator. You can temporarily forget about your current responsibilities while being totally absorbed in the heat of the competition, now that the fiery Sagittarius New Moon activates your 5th House of Fun and Games. Strenuous physical activity may have the most measurable positive results, but nearly anything that encourages you to be spontaneous is healthy."
virgo,2015-12-11,"A strong yearning to retreat into your past can distract you from the present moment. However, you're motivated to recover a memory that has particular relevance while the open-minded Sagittarius New Moon illuminates your 4th House of Roots today. Unfortunately, your thoughts might be so vague now that you wind up frustrated rather than comforted. Although looking in the rear-view mirror sounds appealing, focusing your intentions on the possibilities of the future is ultimately more constructive."
libra,2015-12-11,"Rambling philosophical discussions with close friends or associates take your mind off more serious problems today. The feisty Sagittarius New Moon stimulates your 3rd House of Communication, creating an anything goes atmosphere in your interactions with others. Unfortunately, these high-spirited conversations won't necessarily change anything right away. Nevertheless, verbal banter can enrich your life now, inspiring you to establish ambitious goals and then do whatever it takes to achieve them. Camaraderie is lovely, but you will still need to put in plenty of hard work to reach your destination."
scorpio,2015-12-11,"You may question the value of your contribution to a project at work as the excessive Sagittarius New Moon exaggerates the potential of your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. You might feel so overconfident about being successful one moment that you reach out too far and throw yourself off balance. However, maintaining your equilibrium is the surest way to lift your spirits and empower you to stretch a little further. You're wise not to over-commit your resources; small steps forward are better than none at all."
sagittarius,2015-12-11,"You're over the Moon with enthusiasm, even if you don't have any special plans scheduled today. You're cruising for excitement while the adventurous Sagittarius New Moon buzzes your 1st House of Self. However, it may be easier to conjure up an innovative idea than to turn it into tangible results now. Thankfully, you can increase your chances of getting what you need if you don't automatically assume you deserve it. A little self-control goes a long way, especially when combined with a dash of humility and a splash of grace."
capricorn,2015-12-11,"You're uncharacteristically eager to rush blindly into a new project before you know all the details. Nevertheless, you're probably missing pertinent facts now that the exuberant Sagittarius New Moon stirs up mischief in your 12th House of Secrets. There's no need to make any life-changing decisions today; in fact, intentionally slowing down your progress buys you more time to consider all the alternatives before making your next move. Although your impatience is driving you crazy, slow and steady really does win the race."
aquarius,2015-12-11,"You're irrepressibly excited about your plans for the rest of the year as the visionary Sagittarius New Moon wires your 11th House of Groups. The thought of making memories with friends and family emboldens you to fill your calendar with even more activities. However, you could grow so busy that you end up exhausted from all of the fun. Don't blame your bad decisions on anyone else if you discover you bit off more than you can chew. Pare back your social schedule before it's too late; a stitch in time saves nine."
pisces,2015-12-11,"New career trajectories are opening up for you, revealing the possibility of altering your life path. However, you might be struggling to let go of old dreams as the current ones grow in significance. The aspiring Sagittarius New Moon transforms your perspective of your 10th House of Status, showing you where you are blocked in your current professional development. But don't mistake a changed course of action for a shortcut. No matter how bright the future looks, your determination will make the difference between failure and success."
aries,2015-12-12,"You're ready to deliver on a recent promise and might be so intent on fulfilling your commitments today that you ignore your friends. Anyone who stands in your path may encounter your wrath, especially if he or she becomes the temporary target of your frustration. Your best move is to deconstruct a large job into smaller tasks that can be accomplished individually. Taking a few baby steps is more reliable now than blindly rushing ahead. Remember, blaming other people is a distraction from the real work at hand."
taurus,2015-12-12,"Although you have a firm grasp on your common sense today, your fantasies aren't going anywhere fast. In spite of your down-to-earth perspective, you're clinging to your dreams with more determination than ever. There's little time now for any emotional detours, so focus on your goals regardless of any temporary setbacks you experience along the way. Don't let this chance slip through your fingers; acting in the present moment is crucial for your success."
gemini,2015-12-12,"You're not very happy today if you have to face a complicated emotional issue that won't leave you alone. It's not that self-doubt is your problem; to the contrary, you could feel quite confident these days. However, you may try to keep the debate on an intellectual level, even when feelings continue to resurface. It's best to relax and let the conversations unfold naturally, since your attempts to avoid the intensity only add fuel to the fire. Nevertheless, living dangerously and sharing your fear of losing control might be all it takes to turn the dynamics in your favor."
cancer,2015-12-12,"You're often the overly emotional one of the group, but it's likely that someone else's feelings could destabilize an already complicated situation today. You prefer everyone to be more careful about saying things that might be hurtful. Your innate sensitivity enables you to see that a kind and respectful approach improves the chances of maintaining peace and harmony. Don't spend too much time resisting what you fear; once everything is out in the open, you should be able to deal with the depth of a problem with fierce compassion."
leo,2015-12-12,"You might insist that other members of your family hold up their end of the deal and do what they promised. You can be a stickler for details while the Moon works her way through your 6th House of Efficiency today. Just remember, your standards may be more exacting than anyone else's now, even if you believe that you're going easy on them. It's admirable to strive for perfection, but allowing room for everyone to be human does more good in the long run. Keep in mind there are many ways to measure success."
virgo,2015-12-12,"You are eager to kick back and enjoy yourself today once you have fulfilled your obligations. But don't passively wait for an invitation; do something that allows your creativity to shine. It's likely others will resist making commitments now, so don't count on them joining you on your escapade. It's wonderful to have a partner in crime along for the ride, but there's something thrilling about venturing out on your own. After all, you only live once."
libra,2015-12-12,"Although you are often known as the peacemaker of the zodiac, you may be the one who stirs up a bit of trouble today. Your anger could boil over now, especially if you think you're being taken for granted. Participating in an interactive process can certainly be gratifying, but not if others won't take the time to recognize your contribution to the group process. Nevertheless, having a major meltdown isn't the best way to get noticed. Ultimately, choosing a less dramatic path earns you the respect you seek."
scorpio,2015-12-12,"There's absolutely no reason to beat around the bush today. There are issues that need to be addressed, and any attempt to withhold your feelings just makes them harder to ignore. The Moon's conjunction with chatty Mercury emphasizes your 3rd House of Communication, inspiring you to express what's on your heart. Pick up the phone, write an email or fall back on the old-fashioned method of actually talking face to face. The method isn't as important as the message."
sagittarius,2015-12-12,"You may be required to handle an unpleasant situation today that brings up old self-esteem issues. Naturally, you're capable of demonstrating your confidence, but now your swagger is a convenient cover for a deep insecurity that you want to keep to yourself. Believe it or not, it takes a lot less energy to share what you're feeling than to hide it. Additionally, the subsequent conversations might bring you closer to someone you admire. Softening your defenses and revealing your vulnerability is a sign of strength, not weakness."
capricorn,2015-12-12,"You might feel the pressure of discordant emotions building like a smoldering volcano. You can try to intellectualize your plans, but it's not wise to keep your passions buried beneath the surface now. If you want to avoid the consequences of an uncontrollable eruption today, express yourself instead of slipping into denial. However, it's best to start slowly by letting off a little steam with a friendly audience. Self-revelation is never an easy process; nevertheless, improving a long-term relationship begins with brutally honest communication."
aquarius,2015-12-12,"It seems like reining in your imagination should be a simple task, but all the good intentions in the world won't turn off your fantasy generator today. You can't stop thinking, even if you don't like where your thoughts take you. Unfortunately, the more you try to shut out your dreams, the louder they grow. Your best strategy is to simply observe your inner process with as much objectivity as possible. Instead of courting frustration by attempting to ignore your outrageous ideas, just let them come and go on their own. You never know when you might discover a diamond in the rough."
pisces,2015-12-12,"You aren't necessarily looking for trouble today, but it might find you anyway. Retreating back into the privacy of your inner world seems like a clever way to sidestep an uncomfortable situation. However, you could end up internalizing your current anxiety unless you face it directly. Keeping your cool even when you are caught up in the drama of the moment offers a chance for the tension to quickly fade. The truth may be a tough pill to swallow; the only way out is the way through."
aries,2015-12-13,"You may be annoyed if circumstances don't go your way today, requiring you to jump in and handle an unexpected crisis. Although a twist in the plot isn't normally enough to stop you in your tracks, you are ready to call off the battle now so you can catch your breath. Intuitively, you know there are many ways to measure progress and not all of them matter. Your greatest satisfaction starts with a simple change in your attitude. Let go of your preconceived agenda and embrace the element of surprise."
taurus,2015-12-13,"It seems as if you're spinning around in circles without getting much done today. Thankfully, you can still meet your commitments as long as you don't throw in the towel too soon. Whether you're out running errands or just working around the house, concentrate on one task at a time. You may surprise yourself with how much you finish if you make a commitment to focus, rather than allowing yourself to be distracted by every little thing. The key to your current productivity comes from establishing priorities now and rewarding yourself with rest and relaxation later."
gemini,2015-12-13,"You are more than ready for the hectic pace of life to settle down today, but instead, you seem to face one irritating problem after another. Even if you can minimize the complications, your natural curiosity drives you to seek answers to an ever-growing list of questions. But your obsession for more information is an obstacle to your success. Fortunately, you can easily break this frustrating pattern once you realize that too many facts are almost as bad as no facts at all. Ironically, the apparent chaos was created by you and can be undone by your decision to live in the present moment."
cancer,2015-12-13,"You don't always like other people making decisions for you, but someone's interference might come as a welcome relief today. Take your cues from a trustworthy friend since he or she will steer you in the right direction. Unfortunately, your unfulfilled dreams could negatively influence your choices if you rely on your own instincts now. Just remember, heeding sound advice doesn't alleviate you of the final authority; ultimately, you're the one who must walk along the path you choose."
leo,2015-12-13,"It bothers you to be tied to one predetermined course of action, but you're wise enough to acknowledge when something is for your own good. Swallow your pride and play the role expected of you today, especially if you want to be known as a person who follows through on your promises. Instead of rambling on about your dreams now, get busy with the work at hand. There's little time to waste; the truth is you will be judged by your accomplishments and not your words."
virgo,2015-12-13,"Everyone seems to look to you for guidance because your practical outlook is exactly what they need now. Your friends and relatives beg for your assistance because they're doing everything they can to make up for previous inefficiency. You might be in the mood to enjoy a day of rest but, nevertheless, you are still likely to help the ones you love out of a sense of obligation. There is no point in begrudgingly doing what's expected of you. Act from your heart or don't do it at all."
libra,2015-12-13,"Family responsibilities may interfere with your ability to participate in other activities today, but you can do it all if you manage your time thoughtfully. You know that your loyalty to those you love trumps all the other items on your daily wish list, so you won't likely run out before you've done your duty. Just remember that approval from others isn't the only thing that matters, so follow your conscience when setting priorities. There's no stopping you if your actions are aligned with your heart."
scorpio,2015-12-13,"Establishing a steady rhythm today enables you to accomplish much more than you ever thought possible. Adhering to a set schedule works to your advantage, even if you're planning on a day of relaxation. No matter what, don't commit to more than is feasible, for the pressure you place on yourself will make you anxious. Thankfully, others appreciate your honesty even if it's awkward at first. Your willingness to tell the truth is more important than almost anything else now."
sagittarius,2015-12-13,"You appear to be a pillar of stability today, even in the face of uncertainty and unrest. Your current determination to meet your obligations may win the admiration of your family and friends. But it's not about how hard you work; it's about your uncharacteristic practicality. You don't need to conjure up any brilliant ideas or perform with great expertise. All you must do is stick to the acknowledged agenda the best you can now. There will be plenty of time to wander off the beaten path later on."
capricorn,2015-12-13,"Although you may be known as the champion of responsibility, your current success comes from your skill at blending your competence with a disarming emotional vulnerability. People find you extremely approachable today and are more likely to share their feelings with you. In return, you find it easy to present your softer side without sacrificing your strength. Even if you believe maintaining an air of authority is prudent, you will be happier now if you open your heart."
aquarius,2015-12-13,"You might not understand all the nuances to your feelings today, but this doesn't mean that you should try to bury them. Although you're quite capable of hiding your frustrations, denying your emotions isn't a healthy strategy. It's always wise to be more conscious of your unexpressed needs before responding to any complex situation. As the anti-guru Krishnamurti proclaimed, ""The highest form of human intelligence is to observe yourself without judgment."""
pisces,2015-12-13,"Your assistance on an emotional cleanup team could be required today, especially if you are guilty of creating the original mess. Your recent declarations may have offended someone and now you must smooth over any feelings that were inadvertently hurt in the process. Thankfully, your determination to speak your mind with compassion sets a good example for everyone else to follow. A  heartfelt ""I'm sorry"" works wonders when it comes to mending fences."
aries,2015-12-14,"You're not in total control of circumstances at work today. You could overcompensate by presenting an optimistic front, but you're not nearly as confident on the inside as you appear on the outside. Becoming more cognizant of your extreme emotions enables you to react with less fear. Although you can think on your feet better than most, it's still wiser to allow extra time for contemplation now rather than responding immediately. If your idea was good at first, it will be even better by tomorrow."
taurus,2015-12-14,"You want to share everything you feel in a big way now, but your desired level of disclosure might be too much for everyone else. Gigantic Jupiter in your 5th House of Play is pulled off center by the willful Sun, making it nearly impossible to express yourself objectively. You may claim you are protecting someone else from getting hurt, but you're also reducing the pressure on yourself. If you are going to dig in your heels about anything now, demonstrate your determination to grow from your current experiences. Communication is a two-way street."
gemini,2015-12-14,"You may not be the person who normally gets so caught up in a cause that you make a stand in public. However, you could become so attracted to a political ideology now that it plays on your need for emotional security. Luckily, if your intentions are honorable, almost nothing will be able to stop you, especially if you're willing to reveal your own shortcomings in the process. Nevertheless, possessing accurate information is absolutely crucial today, so familiarize yourself with all the issues before jumping on the bandwagon."
cancer,2015-12-14,"Surprisingly, your confidence is running on overdrive today, prompting you to believe that you can overcome nearly any obstacle. Every single invitation sounds like an exciting opportunity you simply can't refuse. However, you might say yes to so many potential adventures that you struggle to keep up with them. Good intentions only count for part of the battle; it's necessary to set sensible priorities before you even take your first step. If you attempt to do a little less, you will enjoy yourself a lot more."
leo,2015-12-14,"Your social life gets an extra boost from the cosmos today, yet the favorable attention you receive can outlast the moment if you continue to stay true to your own values. This admirable tactic isn't about resting on your laurels or remaining stuck in place. There could be very powerful forces at work now that you don't completely understand. It's better not to confront opposition head on just yet. Have faith that your intuition will know when it's time to act and trust the universe to provide you with the answers you need."
virgo,2015-12-14,"You often excel at logically discerning what's best at each intersection of life, but this innate skill doesn't stop you from making bad decisions sometimes. Unfortunately, you may make a choice today for all the wrong reasons. Don't put your career goals ahead of personal dreams you know to be good for you. Try to keep everything in perspective now; otherwise, you will likely take on more than you can handle. If you overextend, you'll just have to go back and start all over again. Learn the art of saying no before it's too late."
libra,2015-12-14,"Your heartfelt desire to do the right thing makes your life more complicated than you expected. However, you really don't have much of a choice when it comes to those you love. Today's Sun-Jupiter alignment tempts you to over-indulge, even if you are doing your best to avoid extremes. You need to do what resonates with your imagination now that your key planet Venus aligns with fantasy-prone Neptune. Demonstrate your courage and move confidently in the direction that you wish to go in your life."
scorpio,2015-12-14,"Finding a healthy balance is nearly impossible when you're captivated by so many intriguing possibilities. Your desire to create a sense of harmony in your life is extremely strong now, but you want to entertain all of your options, nonetheless. Honestly, you don't want to miss any of the social opportunities that pop up on your radar screen today. You can't be all that surprised if the serenity you seek seems elusive. Peace and quiet will arrive sooner than you think if you don't make so much noise searching for it."
sagittarius,2015-12-14,"You are highly motivated to make something positive happen today. However, your ability to think big is at once your strength and your weakness now, because you may be tempted to put your efforts toward a project that is better left undone. Unfortunately, your key planet Jupiter is so out of control that you could do something foolish. Thankfully, applying a healthy dose of common sense should be enough to do the trick. You can accomplish amazing feats if you keep both feet on the ground."
capricorn,2015-12-14,"You're worried about finishing everything that you accepted responsibility for doing today. But a few enticing distractions can change the landscape of your day as opportunities appear that look too good to be ignored. Normally, you can remain on track without much effort. However, your current lack of objectivity makes it difficult to determine what is most important. Keep in mind that bigger isn't always better when it comes to your plans for the future."
aquarius,2015-12-14,"Harnessing the power you possess might be more challenging today than it seems. Unfortunately, you may have to venture into less-than-comfortable emotional realms to make the most of the current cosmic gifts. Although processing your feelings isn't as straightforward as untangling your thoughts, this is where your true creativity is born. Loosening your grip on the reins of rationality allows your heart to express in a more natural manner. Fly, baby, fly."
pisces,2015-12-14,"Movers and shakers enter your life now, bringing a variety of ventures to your door. Unfortunately, you might harbor an unrealistic understanding of the current potential because your confidence is as high as your expectations. But there's no need to work yourself into a frenzy if your path ahead isn't clear. You won't likely solve this particular dilemma today; luckily, the most reliable opportunities won't require an immediate answer. Be as mellow as possible and see how things develop before making a final decision."
aries,2015-12-15,"You may grow weary of all the noise today, for it seems as though everyone has something to say. But it's not the volume of communication that bothers you; the problem is emotional conversations don't seem to move you any closer to your goals. Continuously getting things back on track is exhausting with so many interruptions. Although you naturally assume you don't have time for this level of powerful intensity, you might be in for a sweet surprise. Once you push through your resistance, a wonderful experience could be yours."
taurus,2015-12-15,"It's rather unsettling when you're trying to act professionally but don't appear to be in total control of your feelings. It's especially annoying now that people seem to infringe on your solitude with their problems. Ironically, you might be seeking something more in life today, even if you don't know what it is. Don't worry if you aren't satisfied with your current situation at work. There's no point in letting fleeting feelings determine your future when everything is in transition. Finding solace in spiritual pursuits is one way to discover your answers."
gemini,2015-12-15,"Although you might be one of the lucky ones who truly enjoy your work, stress can still plague you if your job doesn't offer you the security you need. Thankfully, the positive benefits probably outweigh your concerns of instability. Clinging to the past can prevent the next step of your future from unfolding. It's likely that your responsibilities are in flux and you'll feel more confident once you know your new direction. Fortune favors the bold."
cancer,2015-12-15,"You haven't the slightest idea which way to turn now because you can't resolve your need for emotional connection with a growing desire for independence. This unfamiliar ground can be frightening at first, since you usually feel more secure when you are in a fully committed relationship. Don't push your feelings away, even if they raise uncomfortable issues. There's no time like the present to face your fears; follow your heart wherever it leads."
leo,2015-12-15,"You yearn for more time to spend with your family now, but you're not keen on slipping into a familiar old routine. You want to experiment with new activities or, perhaps you even hope to start a major project today. Don't rush into anything too quickly or your off-the-cuff decision will lead you astray. Take what time can be carved out of your day and enjoy hanging out with those you love without any extra expectations. Home is where the heart is."
virgo,2015-12-15,"Your frustration level may rise if someone denies you the chance to try an innovative solution to a problem at work today. Thankfully, all should turn out well if you can master the art of patience. Temporarily relaxing your agenda and accepting that things won't always go your way is your secret to success. Paradoxically, your flexible attitude might shift the dynamics completely, allowing you to execute your original plan once the dust settles. Trusting in the wisdom of the universe serves you well."
libra,2015-12-15,"Maintaining control over your purse strings might be next to impossible today because you are overly attached to buying something that will make your heart purr with pleasure. Visualizing a variety of ways to indulge yourself is one thing, but chasing material dreams won't bring lasting satisfaction. You'll probably be much happier in the long run if you favor simplicity over anything else. Too much looking often blinds the eye that seeks but never finds."
scorpio,2015-12-15,"Although your closest friends and relatives already know how intense your emotions can be, they still might not expect the abruptness at which your attitude shifts today. You could even surprise yourself as your mood wavers and you reverse your position for no apparent reason. Fortunately, there's no need for detailed explanations now; your feelings won't change just because you think you should be rational. Those who truly matter will accept you without judgment as long as your intentions are honorable and you aim from the heart."
sagittarius,2015-12-15,"Your colleagues look to you for inspiration because you wear your independence so proudly. At first blush, it appears as if your choices are guided by lofty ideals and well-considered philosophical truths. But it's tough to act on your beliefs when your head and your heart are not in agreement. Nevertheless, don't go silent about your observations today; sharing your personal struggles makes you even more lovable than you already are. Your vulnerability is a gift that others will cherish."
capricorn,2015-12-15,"There's not much that can constrain you today, because you can see the unrealized potential in every situation. Nevertheless, you strive for a more balanced approach because you don't trust extreme emotions. But seeking moderation isn't the same as choosing based upon a personal preference. Instead of trying to maintain your objectivity now, bring your heart into the equation by asking yourself what you really want. Your willingness to be surprised by the answer may create the magic you were seeking all along."
aquarius,2015-12-15,"Although the changes you once dreamed about are already under way, you could seriously doubt that you are progressing toward your goals today. Fortunately, this uncertainty is part of a natural process and will dissipate on its own over the days ahead. In the meantime, visualize what your heart desires instead of focusing on what you don't want. The power of positive thinking is stronger than just saying no because you are worried about the consequences if you say yes. Let your faith be bigger than your fear."
pisces,2015-12-15,"There are many tasks that require your undivided attention today, yet you must be ready to change direction in a moment's notice. Responding in the wrong way to an unexpected event could quickly unravel your plans. Unfortunately, the situation might grow unmanageable if you attempt to push forward with your preconceived agenda. However, dealing with a simple twist of fate won't be much of a problem at all if you remain light on your feet. Hope for the best, prepare for the worst and expect nothing."
aries,2015-12-16,"You're eager to hitch your wagon to the nearest star today and simply hope for the best. Although you may grow discouraged, you're not ready to give up on your dreams. You believe good news is just around the next corner just waiting to override your current troubles. However, it's healthier to share your dissatisfaction now, because telling the truth can be the catalyst you need to escape the mundane realms. Shaking everything up might be enough to do the trick."
taurus,2015-12-16,"You may be surprised by the intensity of your negative reactions today, especially if you thought everything was progressing according to your plan. If you're participating in a group decision on a family matter, it might be impossible to keep your emotions hidden from everyone else. Don't bother  withholding your feelings; maintaining your integrity is more important than receiving approval from those you love. Taking the high road allows you to be compassionate while still being honest."
gemini,2015-12-16,"Expressing your personal freedom comes at a price today because you would prefer to pursue pleasure instead of meeting your professional obligations. Keep in mind that whatever you choose to do, the outcome won't be exactly what you expect. More importantly, escaping responsibilities might not be as much fun as it sounds, making it wise to postpone playtime for now. Thankfully, focusing on the practical aspects of your life provides a deeper sense of satisfaction when your work is done."
cancer,2015-12-16,"You might as well accept the fact you're going to run into some familiar obstacles today that get in the way of your personal plans. Perhaps you imagined a perfect scenario, only to find that your feelings aren't following the script in your head. Letting go of old expectations enables you to make unanticipated progress on the home front. Sometimes the scenic route, complete with detours and delays, turns out to be the road that leads to happiness."
leo,2015-12-16,"Previously made promises must be acknowledged now, even if there are still too many pieces of the puzzle missing. Nevertheless, it's tough to know how to handle the current situation until you have all the facts at your disposal. Unfortunately, you can't get away with doing nothing today even if you're not ready to respond. The truth is you might know more than you realize. You won't go wrong if you take the time to listen to your heart. Trust your instincts when all else fails."
virgo,2015-12-16,"You're anticipating something special today, but the big news might be that nothing very exciting happens. Even if you are lucky enough to partake in pleasurable delights now, your outward response could be somewhat subdued. Unfortunately, you may pay a price for withholding your reactions and displaying an even-keeled front. Although keeping cool sounds like the safest strategy, your emotional detachment creates waves of its own. Expressing your feelings is risky business, but the potential rewards make it worthwhile."
libra,2015-12-16,"A change in your daily routine can bring an unexpected sense of exhilaration as you are temporarily released from the drudgery of your work. Unfortunately, you may run into trouble determining your new course of action, tempting you to settle back into your regularly scheduled activities. Don't worry about what you should or shouldn't be doing today; let your heart -- and not other people's expectations -- guide your choices throughout the day."
scorpio,2015-12-16,"Your intuition tells you that a creative burst of energy could turn a simple day into something special. Unfortunately, the lightning might not strike at all, leaving you emotionally deflated and confused now. Meanwhile, an unexpected chore may be dropped into your lap and you must spend your spare time working, rather than playing. Don't waste energy fighting against the inevitable or you'll be too tired to kick up your heels when the opportunity finally arrives. As Tom Petty sings, ""Some days are diamonds, some days are rocks."""
sagittarius,2015-12-16,"You might not be your regular cheery self today, making others wonder if they did something to upset you. The truth is you aren't eagerly looking forward to the rest of the workweek. You don't want things to continue in the same old way; you may even wish to turn your routine upside down for the sake of change. However, it's not a good time to push the envelope too aggressively. Hold onto your hat until tomorrow. Stop focusing on the negatives, adjust your attitude by counting your blessings, instead."
capricorn,2015-12-16,"Your responsibilities are complicated by overlapping promises you made to different people. Although you're often a pro at simplifying chaos, it's not so easy to reduce the current complexity into a viable plan. The first step is acknowledging you can't be everything to everyone. Set new priorities and inform others of your limitations before it's too late. Ultimately, you'll be more appreciated for your honesty than your productivity if you deliver your message with care."
aquarius,2015-12-16,"Your impulsive decisions could rattle the cages of your friends or associates today, temporarily turning allies into enemies. But don't act on your fears and fight back now, or things will just become even more convoluted. Thankfully, success can be yours if you sidestep direct confrontation for a while longer. Placing distance between you and the situation provides everyone with a much-needed fresh perspective. Hopefully, time heals all wounds."
pisces,2015-12-16,"You're unclear how to best express yourself within the context of relationships today, especially if someone seems to be withholding his or her true emotions. Although tense situations sometimes require extreme reactions, losing your temper now won't solve anything. Be as diplomatic as possible in your approach; your attempts at making everyone's life a little easier will also improve your own."
aries,2015-12-17,"Everyone is counting on you to follow through with your end of the deal, but crossing off the tasks on your list is just the start. Jumping through all the hoops isn't going to be enough to prove your devotion today; you must perform your duties with heartfelt conviction. Go the extra mile by showing up and giving it all you got. Raising the bar of excellence demonstrates your intentions more effectively than words ever could."
taurus,2015-12-17,"You refuse to gloss over a sticky issue today because you believe that digging beneath the surface will eventually create the intimacy you seek. But the current situation isn't about quick answers or transient pleasures; the hidden magic won't be part of your experience unless you are committed to going deeper. Luckily, there's no need to rush the process when it's more interesting to let things unfold organically. It's not surprising that the longer you sustain a meaningful connection, the better it gets."
gemini,2015-12-17,"You can't simply ignore the presence of others in your space because they have something important to teach you today. Unfortunately, an interaction might not seem like a lot of fun at first, but the dynamics quickly improve if you show your more vulnerable side instead of posturing in a defensive manner. Listen without feeling the need to respond immediately. Don't allow your clever charm circumvent the chance of deepening a significant relationship. When in doubt, err on the side of your heart."
cancer,2015-12-17,"You really don't want to deal with anyone's negativity today, especially if it's directed at you. Nevertheless, it might feel as if people are on your case now, tempting you to dismiss their words without any regard for what they are trying to tell you. Fortunately, you can push through a barrier that seems to be standing between you and a potential adversary if you're willing to reveal your true feelings. But make sure to give the other party plenty of time to explain their intentions. Total honesty is the first step toward establishing an atmosphere of respect and harmony."
leo,2015-12-17,"Your current secrecy at work makes perfect sense because you don't want your feelings to impede your efficiency. In fact, you prefer to lock your emotions inside until a more appropriate moment, such as when you're alone with a close friend or partner. Unfortunately, you still might appear more transparent than you realize, prompting others to wonder why you are pretending all is well. There's no reason to share your whole story yet, but it may be quite useful to acknowledge your dilemma with someone you can truly trust."
virgo,2015-12-17,"Your pragmatic approach to life helps you manage the powerful emotions that are simmering on the surface today, even if they are just below the threshold of expression. You don't need to tell everyone what's on your mind; your feelings are yours, alone. However, suppressing your desires is not the healthiest of long-term strategies. Start by giving yourself free rein to explore your unexpressed fears and unfulfilled dreams. Thankfully, bringing them out of the shadows lessens their intensity, allowing you to move on to more practical concerns."
libra,2015-12-17,"Not surprisingly, your prosperity grows as your self-image improves and your doubt transforms into certainty. You could make significant financial gains today as powerful Pluto forms a supportive sextile with resourceful Venus while she travels through your 2nd House of Money. But your current success might not manifest as you  expect. Dream bigger than a modest raise or promotion; following your heart can transform your life. However, your patience is required because the process of metamorphosis does not happen overnight."
scorpio,2015-12-17,"Your needs are undeniably strong and may be so complex now that you don't want to address them. Seductive Venus channels her energy into dark Pluto today, reminding you not to open a can of emotional worms for anyone who hasn't already proven his or her trustworthiness. There is nothing wrong with being selective about your audience; keep conversations on the casual side until someone earns your respect by showing a willingness to swim in dangerous waters. People with great passion can make the impossible happen."
sagittarius,2015-12-17,"Your unexpressed desires lead you on a wild goose chase today as you seek an elusive resolution to a dilemma. You strive to be honest, but you also want to keep the mood lighthearted. Unfortunately, you might need to jump directly into the confusing realm of your conflicted feelings to sort things out. Magically, once you begin to reveal your secret dreams, they don't seem as problematic. Shining the bright light of your awareness into the unknown changes everything for the better."
capricorn,2015-12-17,"Your previous efforts pay off today as colleagues assist you in ways you might not expect. Friendly Venus makes herself comfortable in your 11th House of Networking, enabling you to disarm people with your special blend of charm and authority. Those who know how serious you are when it comes to business will vouch for your authenticity. There's no reason to let pride stand in your way; don't resist help from your peers when it's offered. Everyone benefits when others feel invested in your success."
aquarius,2015-12-17,"There's so much activity occurring behind closed doors or in the confines of your mind today that it's impossible for others to know your true intentions. Thankfully, your associates might assume the best and approve of your apparent direction, even if they don't yet possess all the facts. But don't waste energy rationalizing your goals when you need to concentrate on moving toward your ultimate destination. There will be plenty of time to explain everything after your success is already won."
pisces,2015-12-17,"You are slowly regaining clarity about your plans for the future, but it's still too soon to put your ideas into words. In fact, your friends and associates might not be interested in what you have to say now. They want tangible results, not just idle promises. However, it may take several days for your current actions to bear fruit, so keep your immediate expectations to a minimum. Attempts to force resolution are counterproductive and will only slow down your progress. The only person you need to prove anything to is yourself."
aries,2015-12-18,"Trailing behind the pack isn't your usual style, but today you find odd satisfaction in letting others take the lead. However, the longer you're not first in line, the more restless you grow. The Moon's afternoon shift into your action-packed sign is your cue to reassert your command. Unfortunately, you can come on so strong that you encounter push-back. Focus less on reclaiming the seat of control and put more effort into minding your own business, instead. Others will follow you when they witness your productivity, not when you're racing out in front."
taurus,2015-12-18,"There is a welcome sense of contentment in the air as your workmates acknowledge your contributions today. However, their words of appreciation might only whet your appetite for more recognition. Unfortunately, you can become stuck on your desire for fame or fortune now, prompting others to withhold further support. You could feel as if you've gone from top cat to the dog house in the blink of an eye. Don't panic; instead, quietly channeling your passion into your work gives everyone a reason to sing your praises again."
gemini,2015-12-18,"Keeping up a steady pace at work can be a challenge for you flighty Twins, especially if you feel emotionally detached from your family and loved ones. Your weariness may be taking its toll on your outlook, especially if you've been pushing yourself too hard recently. Don't slack off on meeting your obligations today, even if you're ready to throw in the towel. Accomplishing your goals now means you'll be ready to ride the incoming wave of energy that serves to revitalize you over the weekend."
cancer,2015-12-18,"You're finding your groove in the workflow today, but little annoyances keep surfacing that distract you from your appointed tasks. At first, it's easy to take all the interruptions in stride; your positive attitude is your saving grace. But like the straw that broke the camel's back, you too have your limit. Tread carefully, or your emotions might lead you right to the edge if you let them. Thankfully, you can employ logic to help you focus on your work rather than the trivialities that pull you off course. As Albert Einstein wrote, ""ninety-nine percent of genius is knowing what's important."""
leo,2015-12-18,"Your optimistic nature prompts you to take on more responsibility than is wise today. Although you hit the ground running, it quickly becomes apparent that you might be losing ground instead of gaining on your goals. Nevertheless, your confidence level makes a big difference in how much you actually accomplish. Set aside any concerns about failure versus success; there's no place for false pride now. If you just show up and do your absolute best, others can't help but be impressed."
virgo,2015-12-18,"Satisfaction is elusive today because it seems as if people keep moving the finish line as soon as you have it in sight. You think you're progressing toward an agreed-upon goal, only to discover that the destination has been changed without your knowledge. Just know that none of your efforts are wasted, even if you take a circuitous route to completing a job. In a day or two, you will see the silver lining in the cloud when you look back at your current frustration. Sometimes a little perspective is all that's necessary to put things in their proper order."
libra,2015-12-18,"You might be slightly disappointed when your ideas are unsupported at work today. Nevertheless, you can make great progress working alone behind the scenes. Although you often prefer the companionship of collaboration, a solo performance now prompts great reviews later on. Set aside your personal feelings and nagging insecurities. Put your shoulder to the wheel and demonstrate to the world what you can accomplish when you set your mind to it."
scorpio,2015-12-18,"This workweek began on a positive note and ends on another one just for good measure. You're riding a creative high while the imaginative Pisces Moon completes her visit to your 5th House of Self-Expression. Thankfully, your associates are currently more accepting of your special skills and give you the leeway to attack a project in your own unique manner. Your colleagues' support inspires you to even greater heights. Even if you feel a bit letdown later this evening, this whirlwind journey will produce surprising results that are well worth your effort."
sagittarius,2015-12-18,"Although it's nearly impossible to sustain a high level of enthusiasm all day, no one will notice that you're experiencing doubt. Still, you don't want anyone to know you're covering up a dance with low self-esteem today. Nevertheless, you feel vulnerable while the Sun in your optimistic sign squares the elusive Pisces Moon as she hides out in your 4th House of Security. The irony is that your friends and associates are likely to  stand by you now no matter what. Taking a risk and sharing your concerns could foster the nurturing environment that you need."
capricorn,2015-12-18,"It's confusing when everyone seems to be saying different things at the same time; you don't know what to make of it all. You thrive when you're working with the facts and standing on solid ground, but today the truth is hard to find and the earth beneath your feet feels like quicksand. Paradoxically, your clash with reality is less about your external world than about your internal terrain. The tide begins to turn in your favor once you stop struggling. Nevertheless, a totally smooth sea never made a skillful sailor."
aquarius,2015-12-18,"You might feel like an outcast today because your values seem vastly different from those of your coworkers. But focusing on the gulf that appears to be growing between you and your peers doesn't lead anywhere useful; it only adds to the discord and mayhem. Instead of magnifying the conflicts, seek common ground wherever you can. Setting mutually beneficial goals creates a cooperative environment rather than an unsupportive one. United you stand; divided you fall."
pisces,2015-12-18,"Your sensitivity may get the best of you today, especially if you can't find ways to establish boundaries when needed. It's a gift to be so compassionate that you always want to help others. But there's a point at which this blessing can become a curse -- and it's up to you to learn how to navigate around this delicate edge. Fortunately, practice makes perfect; don't expect a major epiphany to change your attitude overnight. Just lean into the place of discomfort and use it as a bird leans into the wind to gain momentum. Difficult roads lead to beautiful destinations."
aries,2015-12-19,"Your words are packed with so much punch today that the powerful effect they have on people may surprise you. It's difficult to step out of your own shoes to experience how you come across to others, but the truth is you might not like what you would hear. There's no reason to speak condescendingly or to be purposefully abrasive; you can deliver your point without making an enemy. Instead of trying to gain dominance of a situation by exercising your authority, demonstrate your willingness to meet others halfway. Compromise is your friend, whether you like it or not."
taurus,2015-12-19,"You might wake up believing you are in possession of the ultimate solution to save the world, but you can't seem to get anyone to listen. The perceptive Mercury-Pluto conjunction intensifies your 9th House of Higher Thought, luring you to join like-minded people in a fight for a higher cause. But even if you think the momentum is growing, you may get hot under the collar if your altruistic behavior is misconstrued. The trick is to honor your point of view without trying to inflict it on everyone else. It's helpful to remember the universe is biased toward supporting multiple truths just like a mountain has many trails to the top."
gemini,2015-12-19,"You don't have the time or energy to engage in lighthearted chit-chat today. Although you're often seen as the life of the party, there isn't a valid reason to provide the comic relief when you're currently wrestling with more serious matters. However, your position on an issue may not be as set in stone as you believe, and you won't win any friends by sidestepping an uncomfortable discussion. It's more advantageous to aim for the center of the black hole so you can put this conversation to rest once and for all."
cancer,2015-12-19,"Making loud claims about your flexibility now is not the same as actually remaining open to changes in your environment. The problem is that it takes two to tango and not everyone is in the mood to dance. By the same token, someone else's rigidity is outside of your direct control. Nevertheless, you might be so stuck on a specific destination now that all you can see is the person blocking your path. Remember, there are plenty of stars out there and countless ways to reach them."
leo,2015-12-19,"You are excited about all the creative endeavors  in front of you today. However, reality closes in pretty quickly and reminds you of the commitments you already made for the weekend. You cannot escape your chores while your 6th House of Work and Service is under siege by a ruthless Mercury-Pluto conjunction. Some struggles are just not worth it, but it's entirely up to you to decide how to best allocate your resources. Energy flows where attention goes, so think very carefully about how you spend your time."
virgo,2015-12-19,"Clear your calendar of all distractions today -- even for a short while. A pragmatic approach to an artistic project may bring you to the edge of a breakthrough in your work, but only if you give it enough time. There is a delicate dance between personal expression and your awareness of other people's needs. Moving too far in either direction has negative consequences so be prepared to take an extra minute or two to temper your actions before doing something you might soon regret. However, finding your sweet spot enables you to take your creativity to the next level."
libra,2015-12-19,"People mean well today, but their unpredictable behavior is enough to drive you crazy. You want to rely on the stability of your environment, but things continue to change, nonetheless. Stop trying to fix things that are not yours to fix. As sages throughout history have told us: the outside is merely a reflection of the inner realms. When you blame someone else, you're also inadvertently blaming yourself. Focusing on your spiritual development empowers you to produce the most dramatic improvements."
scorpio,2015-12-19,"No matter how hard you try, you can't stick to your schedule today because nothing seems to be happening on time. It might even feel as if the cosmos has thrown a little chaos into your day just to keep you on your toes. You could obsess about the way things were supposed to go, but lingering over your regrets doesn't lead anywhere constructive. Unfortunately, letting go of your preconceived expectations is more challenging than it sounds. Nevertheless, it can be done. In fact, nearly anything is possible now once you put your mind to it."
sagittarius,2015-12-19,"You are standing at a critical intersection and must rely on your core values to make a significant decision today. Thankfully, you possess the staying power to get the job done while the single-minded Mercury-Pluto conjunction falls in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. Unfortunately, it might be necessary to sacrifice a bit of spontaneity in order to handle your current dilemma. In fact, the more you plan and prepare now, the better the results."
capricorn,2015-12-19,"You are working with a personal agenda today and woe to anyone who stands between you and your mission. Thankfully, no one can win an argument with you since your facts are in order and your delivery is strong. It's almost as if you possess superpowers while Messenger Mercury aligns with unrelenting Pluto in your 1st House of Self. Your persuasive words are backed up by your authoritative manner. But you must use your gift with care since your sterling reputation leads others to believe almost anything you say. Taking yourself a little less seriously helps everyone  relax. Finding the humor in the situation makes your message more palatable to your audience."
aquarius,2015-12-19,"You prefer to downplay your point of view today so you don't have to defend it in public. But your strategy might backfire if you grow resentful of others who impose their beliefs on you. Even simple family dynamics could become complicated if you reach the point where you need to step back in to reassert your control. Fortunately, you can prevent a worse-case scenario from developing by being more forthcoming right from the start. No matter how the day unfolds, sharing your truth sets a fine example for everyone else to follow."
pisces,2015-12-19,"You want to establish a secure place in your social network and will do nearly anything to make sure you're not left out of the action. Unfortunately, you might be so eager to be included now that you sacrifice your integrity along the way. Reassess your values and decide your limits before you make another move. There are beliefs that shouldn't be denied just for the sake of acceptance by your peers. Being your authentic self is the only option that makes any sense if you expect your friendships to stand up to the test of time."
aries,2015-12-20,"Sharing the details of your busy calendar with family and friends may be necessary to keep everything running smoothly today, but you don't have to over-explain your every move. Others are already experiencing information overload and they don't need you to add more noise to the existing mix. Instead of justifying your plans to everyone else now, channel your energy into managing your own time in a constructive manner. Creating a more peaceful existence also has a calming effect on those around you. Find your center and don't stray too far from there."
taurus,2015-12-20,"You're overdue for some respite from the hectic pace of your daily life, but you might not experience any relief today. It's tempting to blame the high intensity on the holiday season, but it's really more about the breakneck speed at which your mind is operating now. Unfortunately, you may feel slightly isolated if you can't connect your thoughts to everything happening around you. But don't try too hard to fit in with the crowd; you can use this time on your own to explore your brilliant ideas. Thankfully, the energy will begin to shift by tomorrow, giving you a chance to catch your breath."
gemini,2015-12-20,"Your social life may be causing you anguish today because everything seems to be more complicated than you expected. Although mischievous Mercury might be wreaking havoc on your life now, it probably feels worse than it actually is. In fact, it's likely that something awesome will come of a breakdown in communication or if your plans fall apart. Don't tenaciously cling to your previous expectations when life has so many surprises in store for you. Open your mind and allow the universe to work its magic."
cancer,2015-12-20,"You plan on keeping your opinions to yourself today, but things that you wouldn't normally say might suddenly slip off your tongue with ease. Although your disclosure could create static in the present moment by upsetting a friend, it may be useful in the long run to clear the air of unexpressed feelings. Believe it or not, everyone will likely feel relieved once the previously hidden issues are finally out in the open. Better the devil you know than the devil you don't."
leo,2015-12-20,"You have certain ideas about how things should be done today and you may feel the urge to tell everyone to back off and leave you alone. But it's not that you want to be isolated from your loved ones; it's just you need to be your own boss now. Remember, your strength of conviction is a double-edged sword; it's admirable to be so passionate about your beliefs, but too much rigidity can stand between you and your current happiness. A little compromise here and there shows that your heart is in the right place."
virgo,2015-12-20,"You're pulled in opposite directions today and struggle to find middle ground. On one hand, your ruling planet Mercury is yelling fire, filling your head with one brilliant thought after another. On the other hand, quicksilver Mercury's alignment with shocking Uranus makes it nearly impossible to focus. Trying to narrow your choices is an exercise in futility now, so just let your ideas flow naturally. You can always return to the most innovative ones to review their merits once your nervous system returns to normal."
libra,2015-12-20,"It takes every ounce of your concentration to see both sides of an important issue today. Your opinions may be uncharacteristically intense now, but there's no reason to express your thoughts unless they add something constructive to the conversation. Nevertheless, you feel so strongly that you're sure your words will make an immediate difference. However, it's wise to wait and see what happens before saying anything at all because you're likely to change your mind as the day progresses. A moment of patience saves you from many moments of regret."
scorpio,2015-12-20,"It's easy to mistake a clever-but-shallow idea for a life-changing deep thought today, but the two are wildly different. Trickster Mercury may nudge you into thinking that a radical new idea is amazing enough to save the world or, at least, to save yourself. But innovative solutions that sound wonderful at first might not stand up to the test of time. Cool your jets and see how your recent epiphany holds up for a few days before proclaiming it to be the best thing since sliced bread."
sagittarius,2015-12-20,"You might grow annoyed today because everyone seems to be moving so quickly that you can't establish an even pace. Just as you sink into a meaningful conversation with someone, there's a new topic on the table or a knock at the door. Unfortunately, your attempts to alter the energetic flow only generate more frustration. Instead of trying to control reality to your liking, take your cues from external sources now and swim where the tides carry you. As Eckhart Tolle wrote, ""Whatever you fight you strengthen, and what you resist, persists."""
capricorn,2015-12-20,"You can tell that your momentum is building, but your excitement could get the best of you today. Obviously, you don't want to miss a significant opportunity, but it may not be fading as quickly as you think. In fact, using your day to get all your ducks in order is smarter than attempting to execute a specific strategy right away. Thankfully, you are blessed with more patience than others, so continue to remind yourself that you don't have to be in a hurry when it comes to matters of importance."
aquarius,2015-12-20,"You may be exhilarated by the buzz of everyone's enthusiasm today, but it's not wise to fall into the trap of hitching your happiness to external events. Rather than making your satisfaction dependent on people's reactions, cut yourself loose from the expectation game. You might not be very productive now, but you can enjoy the freedom that the unsettled energy brings. Give yourself permission to be creative for no other reason than how good it makes you feel on the inside."
pisces,2015-12-20,"You're not sure if it's in your best interest to reveal your thoughts today, especially if you're worried that your dreams are out of sync with everyone else's. Normally, you might respond to this kind of potential conflict by withdrawing to channel your inner hermit. However, something keeps pulling you back toward your friends now. Don't fight your intuition if you are drawn to share your heart. Happiness often sneaks in a door that you didn't even realize was open."
aries,2015-12-21,"You're not in the mood to suffer fools gladly today, since you are committed to a specific agenda at work and are unlikely to be stopped. Although  contemplating your life's purpose has been a valuable detour, you're ready to shift gears and refocus on the present. Obviously, reconsidering your long-term goals can directly impact your trajectory. Nevertheless, even a minor crisis could instantaneously change everything while you balance your panoramic view of the distant horizon with whatever is on your plate. Don't let your career ambitions drown out the sweetness of the current moment."
taurus,2015-12-21,"Although you tend to be more methodical in your methods than most, it's still possible to overlook an important detail today. You can be so proud of your accomplishments that you set your sights even higher. Unfortunately, your single-minded determination could prevent you from hearing the sound advice offered by someone else. Scaling back your worldly commitments gives you time to reconsider your priorities. No matter what you think you know now, rest assured that you do not have all the answers. The wisest of humans are acutely aware of how much more there is to learn."
gemini,2015-12-21,"You may be seeking to cultivate relationships with those who challenge you with opinions that are different from yours. But it's not necessary to change your mind and simply agree with anyone else's point of view. However, you could go to the other extreme and fight fiercely for your position, but there's nothing to be gained by winning an argument now. Instead, just engage passionately and keep an open mind at all times. Life is a much more interesting ride when you leave room for surprise."
cancer,2015-12-21,"Failure is not an option today as you need to explain your intentions to others as concisely as possible. Thankfully, you receive a considerable amount of cosmic help while conversational Mercury is hanging out in your 7th House of Relationships. It's easier than you realize to initiate a discussion on a difficult matter because your thoughts gain clarity as soon as you begin to verbalize your position. Just don't try to share everything all at once; start now and bit by bit you can tell your story to those who care enough to listen."
leo,2015-12-21,"Time is running out on your dreams, or so it feels. You have a pretty good idea of what you want in both the romance and business departments, but life grows more complicated when others don't share your same long-term goals. You are willing to go the distance now, yet someone appears to fall short of your expectations. Even if you are experiencing disappointment in the moment, don't settle for anything less than what you know you deserve."
virgo,2015-12-21,"You could be convinced that you're one of the most pragmatic people on the planet. Nevertheless, you're probably turning molehills into mountains so adeptly now that others are willing to embark on a hard climb to the summit with you. However, this is shaky territory because you don't have all your facts in order yet. Meanwhile, the truth will become apparent sooner or later; if you inflated reality to sell your cause to the crowd, you may be left on the hillside to fend for yourself."
libra,2015-12-21,"An emotionally challenging situation at home may set the stage for an experience that is beneficial for all involved. The opportunity for growth, however, is not likely to arrive in a stress-free environment. Instead of avoiding the bigger issues that surface now, face them head on. Even if there is some discomfort, you won't be disappointed with the results if everyone is honest in the process."
scorpio,2015-12-21,"Although relationships seem to be on an upward trajectory now, the long shadows of hidden agendas and unexpressed feelings can darken your day. You might be concerned that the light of awareness is fading, but you receive an emotional boost from the Moon's sweet trine to potent Pluto. It's in your best interest to transform leftover negativity into positive potential. Ultimately, it isn't about what happens to you; it's about how you respond. Showing your best self leaves no place for your heart to hide."
sagittarius,2015-12-21,"It's nearly impossible to tap dance around the intensity today; ultimately you must go directly through the center, even if your reactions make your life more complicated than necessary. Paradoxically, the more you attempt to control your feelings now, the less predictable the outcome. Fortunately, you can sustain your overall progress if you make only minor adjustments to your responses along the way. Ultimately, things should work out for the best as long as you stay true to yourself while still remaining kind to others."
capricorn,2015-12-21,"Keeping secrets isn't such a good idea now, for your suppressed feelings will likely blast their way out into the open, whether you like it or not. Withholding information can create an energetic blockage, or even a backlash, prompting someone else to step in and manipulate the situation to his or her advantage. Methodically uncovering hidden facts keeps the energy moving in a positive direction. Opening your heart inspires others to do the same."
aquarius,2015-12-21,"It appears as if you're forthcoming with your feelings but appearances can be quite deceiving now. You might even choose to retreat into your shell because you don't want to waste energy expressing anything less than positive. Your current penchant for remaining silent can be awkward for others, especially if they don't know what you think about their plans. Rather than worrying about anyone else's ideas today, focus on your own priorities and honor what's most important to you."
pisces,2015-12-21,"A series of irritating issues may come to an unexpected head today as your patience finally runs out. It might feel as if the current situation is a last-chance opportunity to resolve a lingering problem once and for all. However, you're eager to keep things above board and remain civil in your interactions. If you don't get the ball rolling now, things could quickly spin out of control. Take direct action while you can; he who hesitates is lost."
aries,2015-12-22,"A natural lack of patience is often your undoing but, fortunately, you have the good sense to check your impulses today. You can hear sweet times calling you to escape from your duties, but you're unprepared to face the harsh consequences of unmet obligations. The most intelligent strategy starts with setting a rhythm that won't wear you out before you're done. A steady work pace enables you to reach your goals, so you can surf the fresh wave of energy blowing into your life later this evening."
taurus,2015-12-22,"You possess an unflappable dedication, making it possible to achieve almost anything you can imagine now. Nevertheless, simply stating your intention is fruitless unless you are willing to follow through with a resolute execution of your plan. Your commitment may be steadfast, but you still might need some assistance getting motivated today. It's a mistake to try to do everything on your own; ask an associate to work with you until you gain sufficient momentum. Inspiration is likely to be found wherever you look."
gemini,2015-12-22,"You may be processing strange messages from the cosmos that you downloaded recently, and trying to decipher them could mess with your sense of reality today. The energy seems copacetic until something reminds you of all the parts you still don't understand. But rather than getting lost in unsolvable mysteries while the Moon hides in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness, concentrate on the mundane tasks right in front of your nose. Believe it or not, the simple satisfaction of completing a job will bring more pleasure now than anything else."
cancer,2015-12-22,"Spirited interactions with intriguing people stimulate your creativity today. However, exploring your active imagination doesn't mean that you wish to share your current ideas with anyone else just yet. Your innovative thinking may lead you into exciting realms, but you prefer to remain quiet until you have something tangible to show for your thoughts. Don't let your reluctance to discuss your plans turn into a dance with self-doubt. Be up front about your motives; telling others why you want to wait enables them to be the steady pillars that you need at this time."
leo,2015-12-22,"Don't waste precious energy second-guessing yourself today because your intuition is likely right on target. Unfortunately, overreacting to someone else's doubt could quickly lead you into an argument as you attempt to justify your position without the necessary facts at your disposal. However, it doesn't matter whether others understand why you chose your current path. Just give your very best performance and your friends will eventually see the wisdom in what you do."
virgo,2015-12-22,"As odd as it sounds, setting your goals too high  can actually make you less productive. It's more important to reach your destination now than to exhaust your resources by attempting to go too far. Your natural wisdom comes from your sense of practicality, which means working less today and enjoying yourself more. Don't worry if your current productivity doesn't quite meet your original expectations; there's more going on than meets the eye and you'll easily make up for lost time in the days ahead."
libra,2015-12-22,"You're driven by a strong desire for pleasure today, especially within the safe boundaries of your family or an intimate relationship. Ironically, your wish to experience joy could motivate you to work extra hard, especially if you can imagine the rewards you will receive later for your current efforts. Oddly enough, people might see you as acting selfishly. Just remember that taking care of your own needs is sometimes the best way to replenish your vitality. You have even more to give to those you love when you feel personally fulfilled."
scorpio,2015-12-22,"A close friend might matter-of-factly tell you exactly what he or she thinks you need to know today. However, you may feel as if everyone is turning a simple problem into a convoluted one. People who know you well won't question your ability to overcome an obstacle, but it's still challenging to maintain a healthy perspective. Don't assume a defensive posture or your indignation will only add to the stress. Keep your mind open, no matter what nonsense you hear. A down-to-earth approach now all but guarantees your success."
sagittarius,2015-12-22,"Your ability to see a situation from a more global perspective is one of your greatest strengths. However, the Moon's current visit to your 6th House of Health has you visualizing the improvements you can make to your daily regimen. Although you're tempted to dream big, little incremental steps are more efficient now than setting larger changes into motion. Don't set yourself up for failure by taking on too much. For once, size does matter and thinking small is better than falsely believing that you're capable of fixing everything all at once."
capricorn,2015-12-22,"Your world seems to be in order today and you are relatively optimistic about your life. However, you might avoid making specific plans while jolly Jupiter contacts the Moon as she meanders through your 5th House of Fun and Games. Unfortunately, you could grow lazy as you continue to justify your lack of initiative, but this evasive approach isn't helpful in the long run. Take advantage of this magical moment by mapping out your future while your creativity is running wild and free. Make hay while the Sun still shines."
aquarius,2015-12-22,"Sometimes when you reflect back on your life you only remember the plan that went wrong or a time you failed to meet someone's expectations. Thankfully, you can relive past experiences that bring a smile to your face today as you replay the good times over in your imagination. Regardless of your workload now, the Moon's presence in your 4th House of Roots invites you to take a sentimental journey that could be quite therapeutic. A quick trip down Memory Lane allows you to return to the present moment with a grateful perspective and a lighter heart."
pisces,2015-12-22,"A casual acquaintance could surprise you by stepping up and offering you the support you need to feel safe and secure. The Moon's visit to your 3rd House of Immediate Surroundings indicates that those closest to you might play a more active role in your life now. But don't push these connections too far or you may sour the sweet process that's unfolding. If you try too hard, you could inadvertently create a gulf between you and a true friend. Happily, adopting a more relaxed approach builds bridges over troubled waters."
aries,2015-12-23,"You might quickly work yourself into an emotional frenzy today by following one captivating distraction after another. In a perfect world, you could flit from task to task without completing anything you start. But don't be surprised if your boss demands that you finish one project before you head off to the next. In spite of your natural tendencies, you can do things right the first time around by exercising a little self-discipline. Act in a responsible manner and no one will have a valid reason to question your intentions or criticize your work."
taurus,2015-12-23,"You believe everything is under control as you glide through your day smoothly, maximizing your productivity with clever ingenuity. However, an unexpected turn of events may raise self-doubt about your recent choices. The truth is you can't undo what's happened in the past, but you can make the most of the present. Fortunately, you should be able to maintain your promised delivery schedule if you don't waste too much time replaying your previous performance. Albert Einstein wrote, ""The distinction between the past, the present, and the future is only a stubbornly persistent illusion."""
gemini,2015-12-23,"The buzz factor is off the charts today and you're so excited about your future prospects that your impatience can make you crazy. Unfortunately, bouncing off walls isn't necessarily conducive to accomplishing your goals, even if you like the thrill of it. Your current exuberance leads to trouble unless you allow extra time to complete the work at hand. Try not to make too many plans while promising too much. Make the magic last by pacing yourself to sustain your output until the wild energy settles down."
cancer,2015-12-23,"Your fantasies are more active today than anyone realizes because you're capable of counterbalancing them with measurable productivity. Keeping your daydreams under wraps goes a long way to convince others that your feet are actually on the ground when you're really floating in the clouds. Nevertheless, a sudden shift in the winds of fate could reveal your secret life in a flash. Happily, there's no reason to hide the truth once your work is done."
leo,2015-12-23,"Finding your groove at work is a piece of cake today, enabling you to feel great about your accomplishments. Just keep in mind that whatever you do now has a lasting impact on your future. However, everything is not as breezy and easy as it seems. Serious issues must be addressed and the sooner you deal with them the better. The bad news is your self-expression is so spontaneous that you could overreact in the moment. Ask your friends or colleagues for their advice before you fly off the handle and say something you regret. A drama-free existence improves your productivity."
virgo,2015-12-23,"You're driven to act in a pragmatic and decisive manner, but it's challenging to make practical use of your colorful thoughts today. You might even feel as if you're suspended in another dimension, watching the world below you with bemusement. Obviously, this otherworldly sensation doesn't allow you to get the traction you need to reach your goals. Rather than trying to make the impossible happen, explore all your options without choosing one course of action yet. You can pick a long-term strategy when you land back on your feet in a few days."
libra,2015-12-23,"Your recent commitment to work hard and stabilize your life are still part of your current plans, but you're also itching for a bit of guilt-free fun today. You might even convince yourself that you're just making up for lost time as you reconnect with your inner child or your adult adventurer. Nevertheless, you can't ignore the pressing responsibilities that still need your attention. Fortunately, you are the champion of balance and can moderate your impatience when necessary. Don't give up what you want most for what you want now."
scorpio,2015-12-23,"Your pent-up tension continues to build today, motivating you to search for a healthy way to express your adrenaline. It's tempting to just act out your feelings willy-nilly, but reconnecting with your spiritual center creates ripples of compassion and positivity. Instead of distracting yourself with social events or strenuous exercise now, consider spending some quality time alone with your thoughts. You don't have to do anything at all except increase your awareness. Changing your perspective changes everything."
sagittarius,2015-12-23,"People continue to catch your eye and pique your curiosity today, but your emotional connections may be limited to a superficial basis. Even if you like the idea of building profound relationships, it's more fun to just drop in and out of discussions as your attention waxes and wanes. There's no need to judge yourself harshly now if your energy is scattered and you feel pulled one way and then another. Thankfully, you'll have plenty of time to dig deeper in a few days when you can focus on one person at a time."
capricorn,2015-12-23,"You may worry so much about being stuck in a situation at work that you forget to enjoy the present moment. But it's impossible to interact with your coworkers if you spend so much time in your mind planning your escape. Honor the part of you that wants to explore a variety of other interests now, whether or not you can. There's nothing wrong with remaining open to what the world has to offer. On the other hand, don't let your dreams of the future stand in the way of experiencing the magic that's already at your feet."
aquarius,2015-12-23,"A playful interlude with a good friend or lover is just the thing you need today to regain your healthy perspective on life. Although you may be up to your eyeballs in work or have a long list of errands to run, don't skip this chance to pursue pleasure, even for just a little while. You can always finish up with your responsibilities tomorrow with a big smile on your face and a bounce to your step. You can't always wait for the perfect time when the opportunity is now."
pisces,2015-12-23,"A business or personal connection may be a source of awkward tension now, especially if someone is trying to extract a commitment from you that you're not prepared to give. Share your concerns with the other person if your fears about a negative outcome begin to create doubt. But don't shift the discussion to hypothetical scenarios in the future. Instead of worrying about what could go wrong, keep bringing the conversation back to the present moment. Honest communication is the key to relationship success."
aries,2015-12-24,"Your day starts off quietly enough, but the pace picks up quickly and you can't help but enjoy the buzz. Nearly all the possibilities seem enticing and so many thoughts are racing through your mind now that it's tricky to discern which ones are actually worth pursuing. It's fantastic when you feel this level of enthusiasm, but make sure to finish your work before you rush out the door in search of fun and frivolity. Pride in your accomplishments is a gift you can give yourself."
taurus,2015-12-24,"You get so stuck in your ways sometimes that you drive your friends and associates nuts. However, today's energy is different and you're busy sharing big ideas faster than anyone can assimilate them. Delectable Venus is channeling the boundless energy of jovial Jupiter, inviting you to participate in a cosmic party of pleasure. There's no reason to downplay your current optimism. Freely express whatever visions of abundance and joy that pop into your awareness now. Magic is afoot if only you believe."
gemini,2015-12-24,"Your spirits are soaring today, but the Moon's current visit to your lighthearted sign can also bring strong longings of restlessness. Your moods swing rapidly now, rising and falling and rising again. Others might not get a clear read on you because each time they think they know what you're feeling, your attitude shifts. Don't be overly concerned about other people's expectations; increase your chances for happiness by letting your emotions continue to run their natural course. Sometimes you have no choice but to follow your heart."
cancer,2015-12-24,"This is not a day to keep secrets, even if you normally excel at maintaining clear boundaries. It's not that you want to agitate uncomfortable feelings or betray anyone's trust; you just find it challenging to hold back your emotions now if you feel close to someone. Nevertheless, taking a disclosure too far certainly won't improve a relationship. In fact, it could jeopardize whatever trust is already established. Be conscious of everything you say so that you don't accidentally break your promise of silence. Your word is your wand."
leo,2015-12-24,"Although you're emotionally open today, you still might be inclined to protect yourself if your defenses begin to soften. The good news is people will likely notice the shift in your behavior if you are genuinely interested in cultivating a deeper connection. Retreat is unnecessary when the feelings are mutual; bask in the admiration now, even if it makes you feel vulnerable. Letting your love light shine is a gift to everyone around you."
virgo,2015-12-24,"You may be the one that everyone depends on to put things in order because you're normally quite organized when you're in charge. However, your energy could be a bit scattered today, making it tough to live up to everyone's expectations. Don't worry if there isn't enough time in the day to finish everything on your to-do list. Just attack the most important chores, leaving other less critical tasks to complete when you aren't feeling so rushed. Perfection isn't all that it's cracked up to be, especially when love is all that really matters."
libra,2015-12-24,"If you want everything to be in perfect harmony, you may need to assert yourself more aggressively today than you prefer. Your anxiety increases when you think about all there is to do, but thankfully, you are capable of rising to the occasion. The clever Gemini Moon's presence in your 9th House of Big Ideas is supported by energetic Mars, enabling you to power your way through nearly any resistance you encounter. Happily, you might even surprise yourself with how gracefully you perform under pressure."
scorpio,2015-12-24,"You feel as if everything is going to go as planned today as long as you continue to stay in motion. Maintaining a high level of activity is a key to your current success; nevertheless, conflicting thoughts may distract you from being in the moment as soon as you start to slow down. Although it might hinder your productivity for a while, stopping long enough to reconnect with the spirit of the holidays will bring you more joy in the long run."
sagittarius,2015-12-24,"Everyone seems to be running on a different frequency than you, yet you're not motivated to catch up with them now. However, you can't just take yourself out of the game and expect your friends to willingly play without you. The most effective solution to this dilemma is to simply share your feelings. Engaging in an honest dialogue will take all of you to common ground where you can operate without any unexpressed agendas. Being true to yourself encourages others to do the same."
capricorn,2015-12-24,"Your coworkers seem to be missing the point today and there isn't a subtle way to give them the facts. Unfortunately, you can't go on the offense to set others straight or they will think you're  pushing your own agenda. However, no one will realize there's more to your story if you don't say anything at all. Rather than trying to change anyone's mind, just gently share your perspective and then let each person form their own opinion. The interpersonal dynamics will flow much smoother if you avoid the assumption that you  are the only one with all the answers."
aquarius,2015-12-24,"You're in an extra playful mood today, yet your commitments won't necessarily allow you to drop everything for the sake of fun and games. Nevertheless, complaining about your obligations is a total waste of your time and energy. Instead, resign yourself to fulfilling your current responsibilities as expediently as possible. Time is on your side; you will still have the chance to partake in activities that make you smile later on. Whistle while you work and everyone will sing along."
pisces,2015-12-24,"A family squabble may require your immediate attention now that the Moon is camping out in your 4th House of Domestic Matters. Luckily, you can see all the angles of a complex issue today; unfortunately, your desire to be fair-minded brings uncertainty about which solution is the best one. Your wisest strategy is to avoid taking sides until your clarity returns later in the day. No one can force you to choose your course of action until you're good and ready. Let there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with you."
aries,2015-12-25,"Your entire life path seems up for grabs today. The Cancer Full Moon brightens your 4th House of Home and Family, causing you to wonder how to balance your domesticity with your place in the world. You're trying to figure out how much emotional safety you need before you attempt to reach your goals. Asking important questions now can propel you into action. Although others might see you as acting too aggressively, do whatever it takes to get back on track. Using your powers of concentration empowers you to thrive in a situation that anyone else would call unwinnable."
taurus,2015-12-25,"Loved ones come to the rescue today, encouraging you to shrug off any self-limiting thoughts. Although you might be insecure about your ability to communicate while the hypersensitive Cancer Full Moon shines in your 3rd House of Information, your words can produce a powerful impact. It's not what others say about you that matters the most; the critical component is how you feel about yourself. Nothing is likely to bring you down now if you continue to cultivate a healthy self-esteem."
gemini,2015-12-25,"Your thoughts might be moving so fast today that you can't keep up with every idea. You may have a very sensible plan in mind, but you can still ruin your chances of realizing a goal if you diffuse your energy. The Cancer Full Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Values is a cosmic reminder to focus on what is most important and allow the trivial matters to fall away. The truth is you have your limits just like anyone else. Don't talk about your dreams until you find the right audience. Taking yourself more seriously encourages others to do the same."
cancer,2015-12-25,"You expect people to acknowledge and respect your desire for emotional safety. The evocative Full Moon spotlighting your sensitive sign might send you over the edge today, prompting you to worry that your intentions are misunderstood. However, your needs may be based upon old insecurities -- and no one can fix this if you fear rejection or change. You can't solve this dilemma overnight, but discussing your concerns with someone you love helps you feel more hopeful about the current circumstances. A burden is much lighter once shared."
leo,2015-12-25,"You really want to hold up your end of the bargain but the Cancer Full Moon is sneaking around in  your 12th House of Secrets, prompting you to struggle in ways no one else notices. You know there are specific things you can do to help those you love, but you're already too busy trying to fulfill your previous commitments. You can't do everything you planned, yet your high expectations  make it difficult for you to let go. Nevertheless, everyone will appreciate your generosity if you don't promise more than you can deliver. Love is the gift that keeps giving back."
virgo,2015-12-25,"You fully intend to accomplish your goals today, even if it temporarily means that your needs come first. However, everyone can tell that you want some space because actions really do speak louder than words. But the introspective Cancer Full Moon highlights your 11th House of Friends, encouraging you to retreat into your cozy cocoon for a while. Nevertheless, a social context is still the best place to demonstrate your generosity of spirit. Compromise is key to making everyone happy, including yourself."
libra,2015-12-25,"Knowing what's best is not a simple task, even if today's issues seem vaguely familiar. You might not want to put up with the same level of domestic-related stress now that the moody Cancer Full Moon floods your 10th House of Authority. If you are withholding your feelings, take a deep breath and release them out into the open. Just remember to be kind in your delivery process, even if a power struggle ensues. Ultimately, others will appreciate you going out on a limb to clear the air if you are just as anxious to listen as you are to speak."
scorpio,2015-12-25,"Internal frustration seems to intensify today while direct communication helps to dissipate the energy. However, the emotionally powerful Cancer Full Moon rocks your 9th House of Truth, making it nearly impossible to disengage from a disagreement until it's resolved. Endless fighting doesn't lead to peace of mind; take your old wounds out of the picture and examine the situation from a fresh perspective. If you can create meaning in the midst of the current chaos, then everyone emerges as a winner."
sagittarius,2015-12-25,"You won't run from your feelings today, even if you wish you could walk away from an unpleasant situation. However, your current passion prevents you from just dropping an issue that's important to you. Although you possess realistic expectations now, the protective Cancer Full Moon illuminates your 8th House of Deep Sharing, cautioning you to withhold some of your darker emotions. Proceeding with patient persistence prevents encountering disappointment in the immediate future. Your unwavering optimism saves the day."
capricorn,2015-12-25,"Your acute sense of reality may be tested today as you confront one of your most fundamental fears. The needy Cancer Full Moon stimulates your 7th House of Others, raising concerns that a relationship might draw you into an emotional abyss. More than anything, you don't want to fall victim to irrationality as you attempt to stay on the safe path of logic. Thankfully, you can step beyond your concerns to participate in the holiday festivities and still land safely back on Earth in the days ahead."
aquarius,2015-12-25,"You might not feel so self-assured today because the supersensitive Cancer Full Moon lights up your 6th House of Service, filling you with angst about your current role. But keeping your emotions under wraps leaves everyone wondering why you're acting more distant now. Nevertheless, you don't want to share your experiences, even if someone asks. Temporarily shifting your attention away from your feelings to something more constructive is a clever deflection. Focus on the needs of those you love as you wait for your heart to sort itself out."
pisces,2015-12-25,"You may grow concerned if the uncontrollable swirl of complex emotions is moving too quickly. However, these are well-traveled waters for you Fish and it helps to remember that you are swimming in safe territory. Thankfully, the nurturing Cancer Full Moon brightens your 5th House of Creativity today, inspiring you to feel more positive -- even if you are also overwhelmed. Luckily, success is likely if you allow time for the right situation to gel organically, instead of pushing things ahead too soon. Trust in the magic of the universe and everything will work out fine."
aries,2015-12-26,"Jump-starting a project may be a bigger challenge than you expected today, especially if you previously postponed similar creative tasks. You might even feel as if you hesitated too long, however, there is nothing to be gained by beating yourself up. Be satisfied  with whatever you accomplish now, even if it is less than you promised. You can make up for lost time tomorrow once your key planet, Mars, is freed from the grips of Saturn. No one can fault you if you're doing your best."
taurus,2015-12-26,"Previous obligations to loved ones may have impeded your progress on personal projects in recent months, and  once again they consume a large share of your energy. Naturally, you want to do what is expected of you and make everyone happy, but not at the expense of your own well being. Don't panic and overreact today, even if you can't see an obvious resolution in sight. Channel your frustration into increased effort. You will generate positive results and feel more empowered in the process."
gemini,2015-12-26,"It's often difficult for you speedy Geminis to slow down long enough to follow big plans through to their completion. Unfortunately, a simple project may have morphed into more than you expected. Now it's time for you to get closure on anything you might still have simmering on the back burner. Stick with your original goals for another few days and then reevaluate your recent progress before moving on. Sometimes the best things take a while to marinate before there is sweet success."
cancer,2015-12-26,"You may feel disheartened today if too many responsibilities prevent you from participating in social activities. But there's no reason to throw a pity party for yourself; you can either whine about your current dilemma or do something about it. Instead of trying to change things that are beyond your control, consider where your efforts will have the most immediate impact. You have more power to wield than you realize as long as you don't waste energy on the wrong goals. Choose your battles carefully, show everyone what you can do, and then reward yourself by joining in the fun."
leo,2015-12-26,"Your efforts to make progress at home may be thwarted now, no matter how hard you apply yourself. It could seem as if creating change is as impossible as rolling bowling balls up a hill. In fact, you might hit rock bottom and wonder if it's really worth the trouble. Regardless of your lack of forward movement today, it's crucial to keep working, for you are setting the stage for larger opportunities that will come to fruition over the next year. Your faith is your saving grace."
virgo,2015-12-26,"You might have to shelve that big remodel or the plans to restructure a budget -- at least for a while. If you feel the tendrils of stress sneaking up on you, it's advisable to close your windows and lock your doors. Less action and more understanding is your mantra now. Place your big expectations a few months into the distance and your budding anxiety will vanish. No one is asking you to surrender your dreams, but taking a timeout gives everyone a chance to catch their breath. All is not lost; downshift and be ready to hit the gas when the next opportunity rolls around."
libra,2015-12-26,"Your friends and relatives are not supporting you in the way that you wish today. However, appearances can be deceiving, especially if you are feeling insecure. Thankfully, no one is conspiring against you or judging your every move. In fact, you're all on the same team, even if it doesn't seem that way now. Instead of trying to guilt anyone into joining your cause, release everyone from any favors. If others jump in to help, it will be of their own free will instead of from a sense of obligation."
scorpio,2015-12-26,"There's no time like the present to take a long hard look at the most persistent patterns of resistance in your life. In particular, search for an authority figure (Saturn) who is stirring up trouble, possibly eliciting feelings of anger and resentment (Mars). Reexamine your intentions with an objective eye, but don't push the issues now. Although there might be very little progress made today, the most problematic situation will likely resolve on its own. Change is your friend."
sagittarius,2015-12-26,"A steady hand might be required today as you pursue artsy or crafty activities since your energy is skipping all over the place. Naturally, you prefer to be playing on a tropical island or embarking on a spiritual quest, but there will be plenty of time for adventure at a later date. Continue to place one foot ahead of the other for now. Start a small project you can finish instead of a giant one that is left undone. Creativity plus practicality equals success."
capricorn,2015-12-26,"Normally you possess the good sense to be aware of the motives behind your actions, and sometimes you even know the results before anyone else. However, you may be feeling a bit lost today without your moral compass navigating the way. Your recent goals might have been so far out of line that you are receiving an overdue reality check. It's one thing to reflect back on all the ground you've covered, but things are not panning out to your expectations. Patience, grasshopper; your life is a glorious work in progress."
aquarius,2015-12-26,"Making choices between your personal life and your career is growing more stressful as time wears on. There is another factor in the mix now that confuses your decision-making process even more. Someone may be resisting your efforts while someone else is encouraging you to fight back. Unfortunately, outright conflict doesn't help you reach your goals any faster. Lay low for a bit before pushing forward. Keeping your options open enables you to continue soliciting advice and gathering information. Better safe than sorry."
pisces,2015-12-26,"Your schedule has grown so complex that it feels like you are losing control of the details. You might even believe that you can't honor all your commitments in the limited amount of time allotted. If you somehow managed to over-extended your resources, it's better to explain yourself and cut back now than to wait until it's too late. Setting priorities and establishing boundaries today create a healthier balance in your life tomorrow."
aries,2015-12-27,"You are raring to go now and you're eager to tell everyone about your upcoming creative projects while the Moon is kicking up her heels in your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, instead of receiving the applause you expect today, your plans may fall on deaf ears. An unappreciative audience could send you back to the drawing board, requiring you to rethink your big ideas. But don't view this delay as a defeat: use it as opportunity to improve your chances for success."
taurus,2015-12-27,"Taking care of the chores you should have done yesterday will be less burdensome once you actually shift into gear. However, you may feel as if cosmic forces are working against you now, preventing you from initiating action. Unfortunately, finding the source of these elusive pockets of resistance is challenging. It's tough to change your attitude once you realize completing even a simple task is complicated today. Thankfully, your persistence will open doors that were previously locked."
gemini,2015-12-27,"People seem to enter your life today for the express purpose of encouraging you to take the next step on your journey. But this support may come with a mixed message because following someone else's advice isn't very straightforward now. You're tempted to impetuously rush ahead, but complicated logistics and unwieldy red tape are likely to hinder your progress. Slow down and tend to details that need handling one more time. One can't succeed on inspiration alone."
cancer,2015-12-27,"It's nearly impossible to stick to your plans today, even if you believe that your abundant physical energy and unwavering willpower are enough to power you through any unexpected obstacles. Unfortunately, brute strength won't be sufficient; you must work smarter, not harder. Start by recognizing the limits of your knowledge; faking it will only damage the trust others place in you. Expressing your vulnerability can deepen the bonds between you and those you love."
leo,2015-12-27,"Be wary if anyone attempts to convince you that he or she is right and you are wrong. Other people's arguments may be so persuasive now that you might be tempted to drop your agenda for theirs. Unfortunately, your disdain for details can have you moving so fast that you overlook an important fact or two. Give yourself time to think through any change in plans before you find yourself backed into a corner. A dose of common sense prevents an unnecessary headache later on."
virgo,2015-12-27,"You are leaning towards jumping into a project or organizing a social event, but you might be afraid of someone's negative judgment today. You prefer to do things your way but may not have as much say in the matter as you wish. Your decision doesn't allow for any ambiguity now, requiring a yes-or-no answer. Think very carefully about your desired outcome before choosing whether or not you're willing to sacrifice your freedom. Sometimes the path of integrity is a lonely one."
libra,2015-12-27,"You might not get as much time to yourself today as you were hoping while the Moon shines in your 11th House of Social Networking. Everything and everyone that passes your way is just another bundle of possibilities, making it challenging to turn down any invitations for business or pleasure. Instead of  attempting to limit your options now, follow the course of least resistance. If you stop trying to control the outcome, you could discover something wonderful right in front of your nose."
scorpio,2015-12-27,"You are super-jazzed about turning a corner and starting a new chapter with your work and family, yet you could end up spending too much time trying to keep everyone happy now. You might not be able to work on the larger shift until you open up more free time, especially if you're juggling a number of mundane issues and projects today. In the meantime, balance your anticipation for something different with the constancy of familiar routines. Maintaining a tight schedule is key; timing is everything."
sagittarius,2015-12-27,"You act as if you have all the answers today as you supply family and friends with a constant stream of political and philosophical repartee. But in spite of all your bravado, you just want to emotionally connect with those closest to you. Unfortunately, you could get carried away in an argument about a topic that's not even important to you. You aren't fooling anyone; admit what you don't know and engage others on the basis of honest interactions about subjects that really matter."
capricorn,2015-12-27,"You may discover a few new interesting things to do with your time at home today, enabling you to retreat behind your castle walls without growing bored. It's fun when there are so many possibilities available, but it can be tricky to narrow your choices and just pick one to pursue now. Don't blame your indecisiveness on anyone else. You will feel more like yourself again once you choose a path and begin following the whims of your heart."
aquarius,2015-12-27,"You're feeling quite positive about your current opportunities now, but your friends might not see things in the same light. Although everyone seems to have a different idea of how your life should unfold, it's pointless arguing with anyone else about subjects that are your own personal business. Instead of escalating a war of words, politely excuse yourself from the conversation. Setting clear boundaries gives all those involved a chance to cool off before you revisit the topic at a later date. Maintain the peace at all costs."
pisces,2015-12-27,"If you recently started to put a big idea into motion, today's bold Leo Moon gives your momentum another boost. Although you possess plenty of energy now, it still could be challenging to sustain it over an extended period of time. Even if you're ready to take on the world in a moment, don't burn up your resources all at once. Operate in a methodical manner so you can finish what you start with a smile on your face."
aries,2015-12-28,"You could hold such idealistic expectations today that nothing in the real world will satisfy your ambitions. Fortunately, your fate is in your own hands because you can change the game now by changing your mind about what you want. You don't have to settle for anything less if you simply re-frame your idea of what makes you happy. Touching people with your generous heart is more meaningful than making sure everything goes exactly as planned. Giving the gift of love will add the magic back into your life."
taurus,2015-12-28,"Putting on a winning performance for your friends or family seems like a wonderful way to continue the holiday festivities. But you might inadvertently create unnecessary waves by taking over and doing everything your way. Considering someone's preferences may not be enough to smooth over any ruffled feathers now. The real lesson is that this doesn't need to be a one-person show. Instead, involving others in the planning process from the start fosters the spirit of the season that's beyond the reach of any individual."
gemini,2015-12-28,"You may be running around in circles preparing for a social gathering, but you're also seeking a more spiritual approach to the holiday season. You're often the life of the party because of your witty  conversation, but now you're searching for something more than sparkly lights and transient smiles. You can transform this time by slowing down and focusing on the heart connections between people instead of making everyone laugh with your clever stories. Magic is yours for the making."
cancer,2015-12-28,"Spending lots of money is not the only way to show others how much you care. However, the demonstrative Leo Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Money might tempt you to spring for an extravagant display anyhow. Nevertheless, if you want to be taken seriously today, don't give in to an overly dramatic gesture of affection. Obviously, the bright lights could draw an extra round of applause, but acting thoughtfully will earn you the appreciation and respect you desire. The gifts that matter the most come from the heart."
leo,2015-12-28,"Your resolute follow-through is your ticket to success today because fantastic ideas about entertaining coworkers or celebrating with your family won't be sufficient unless you deliver something special. It's essential to plan every detail out in  advance, since there are too many variables in the mix now. Of course, there will always be factors outside of your control; honestly, you are the only one who expects perfection. Luckily, if ""Plan A"" doesn't work, there are twenty-five more letters in the alphabet."
virgo,2015-12-28,"Your cool ability to minimize the end-of-the-year excitement might make others wonder if your behavior is Scrooge-like. However, closer examination reveals that you're simply saving the best celebration for last. You're happy to ride a building wave of anticipation right into the New Year. Instead of talking about your intentions today, let your actions speak for themselves. Open up your heart and demonstrate your affection while you have the chance. Tomorrow is another day."
libra,2015-12-28,"Hanging out with those you love is more fun than anything else now. However, it may be challenging to reconcile your desire to break free of some holiday traditions this year while still remaining open to what the rest of the group wants. Although you might not see a clear solution to your dilemma, remember there's no single correct path to take today. Being flexible enough to go along with the flow will probably make everyone happier in the long run."
scorpio,2015-12-28,"There may be an established schedule of events today and everyone is depending on you to adhere to the plan. Unfortunately, there's a small margin for error today because the fixed Leo Moon in your 10th House of Responsibility gives you a very specific notion of what you need to do. But even if you suddenly have a different impulse, it's wiser now to just let it pass. Save your ideas for another day when others will be more amenable to a radical point of view. In the meantime, demonstrating your ability to be a team player adds to everyone's satisfaction, including your own."
sagittarius,2015-12-28,"There are many ways to ensure the holidays are a memorable experience for all, yet they will be over so fast that you need to fine-tune your options quickly. Fortunately, you are an instant inspiration to your friends and family because your joyful attitude is so contagious. Although you may have already handed out traditional tokens of affection, you can still create a positive impact by shifting your focus onto establishing lasting emotional connections. Gifts of emotional and spiritual intention are the ones that outlast the others."
capricorn,2015-12-28,"You're weary of being the one who always takes charge when no one else steps up to the plate. But no one seems to realize how much this external pressure weighs on you. However, you almost don't care that others are relying on now. Instead of just burying your feelings, talk to someone you trust. Your anxiety will be less of a nuisance if you can get your concerns off your chest. Surrounding yourself with those who love you, rather than those who love what you do, is the best way to enjoy yourself today."
aquarius,2015-12-28,"You may experience a perplexing series of conflicting desires today. The big-hearted Leo Moon is hanging out in your 7th House of Others, reflecting your need to be actively involved in your relationships now. But several planets in hardworking Capricorn are traveling through your 12th House of Secrets, urging you to stay out of sight. Although wanting to be seen and being invisible are mutually exclusive, you can still find clever ways to honor both extremes."
pisces,2015-12-28,"You don't mind jumping in and helping your family, friends, or community as long as you feel like you're a valuable member of a team. But you might not be as eager to contribute to the cause if you are sitting on the sidelines. Fortunately, others seem to go out of their way to include you today, making it more fun for you to participate. Focusing on an altruistic goal allows you to enjoy a true sense of camaraderie. Consider this a gentle cosmic reminder of how much you receive when you give."
aries,2015-12-29,"You won't have much of an opportunity to rest today if you left too many tasks undone yesterday. Nothing is to be gained by worrying about the outcome; instead, just get busy with your chores right off the bat. But even if you don't have any pressing obligations to fulfill now, you might still be too serious-minded to completely chill out. Thankfully, there will be plenty of time to play later on when you're in the mood. The math is simple; the sooner you get started with what's on your plate, the more likely you are to finish."
taurus,2015-12-29,"Although you're distracted by the pursuit of pleasure now, you might need to wait until a later date to actually obtain your object of desire. In the meantime, it's prudent to direct your attention to more mundane tasks. You're better off setting a measurable goal early in the day and then diligently tracking your progress. Even if you would be happier doing something else today, you can still derive sweet satisfaction from your list of accomplishments. Save the fun and games for when you can play without guilt."
gemini,2015-12-29,"Of course, you know that you should be grateful for the many blessings in your life, but you can't avoid feeling annoyed if you're blocked from chasing your dreams today. Your natural tendency is to sow your ideas like Johnny Appleseed; however, it's more useful now to keep them to yourself until you are certain you have found fertile ground. Even after testing the soil and waiting for the right temperature, take your time to share your thoughts and carefully nurture them until they reach fruition."
cancer,2015-12-29,"You could be overly protective of those you love as you attempt to balance your concerns with their needs. You might not even notice that you have overstepped your role in your haste to do the right thing. Although you want to initiate action for someone else's benefit, consider that your interference may not be in their interest. Sometimes a temporary setback or emotional hurt is the best teacher even if it is hard to witness. Taking responsibility for your actions inspires others to do the same."
leo,2015-12-29,"Your life may already be in a state of flux now that a significant cycle is reaching a turning point. You know you need to narrow your focus, but you're receiving mixed signals from the cosmos. Instead of closing down your mind in fear of making the wrong choice, visualize all the things that make your heart happy. You don't have to do anything at all about your fantasies today if you commit to executing your new strategy tomorrow. Your dreams are the roots of your future."
virgo,2015-12-29,"Your creative juices are flowing and your drive for self-expression is strong, but you might not be confident enough to fully trust your impulses today. Instead of taking an unnecessary risk, play things more conservatively for now. After all, you're not interested in an easy come, easy go solution. Demonstrate your wisdom by building on your previous accomplishments while still progressing on your long-term goals."
libra,2015-12-29,"Although you're quite adept at balancing work and play, relaxing can be challenging today until you complete your unfinished business. Free-floating anxiety may throw you off schedule now, especially if you believe that you are running out of time. Fortunately, an impending deadline is more flexible than you think; instead of wasting your energy on panic and despair, just breathe deeply and continue doing the very best job you can. A moment or two of meditation is the fastest trick to regaining your center."
scorpio,2015-12-29,"People may be making too many demands on your time these days. They might not think twice before asking you for what they want, even if their neediness poses a major inconvenience. It's hard to tell if your associates are aware of the impact of their behavior, so you can't really accuse them of being selfish. However, your loyalty runs deep enough that if a friend requests your help now, you will be there in an instant. Follow your instincts today, but remember that setting healthy boundaries won't detract from supporting those you love."
sagittarius,2015-12-29,"You're so concerned now about what others think of you today that you tiptoe around deciding what is appropriate in your current social sphere. However, you're not any less confident of your judgment just because it differs from the crowd. But you really want to be a team player and will sacrifice some of your personal needs now for the good of the family, group, or community. Honorable intentions bring positive results."
capricorn,2015-12-29,"You might be feeling a bit ornery today, especially if an acquaintance is pushing your buttons. You're short on patience, especially when it comes to situations that aren't your immediate concern. You're not willing to waste your time on trivial matters just because someone else does. But don't be too quick to judge others; politely playing within the rules of social etiquette now will serve you well. Kindness is key."
aquarius,2015-12-29,"You're likely to jump to conclusions now, unless you consciously slow down your mental process. But there's a special trick to making this proactive strategy work; you don't have to change the speed of your thinking. Instead, just increase the amount of time between a thought and the moment you respond. You'll be surprised with the difference you can make if you slowly count to ten before saying a word. A moment of patience in the height of emotion saves many moments of regret."
pisces,2015-12-29,"Someone you admire may stubbornly stand in the way of your satisfaction today, and you might not even have a clue as to their motives. Your first impulse is to ignore the whole situation or just laugh it off to reduce the pressure. But instead of making light of a potential problem, find the courage to initiate a conversation in a nonthreatening manner. Nearly all complicated dynamics are easier to resolve once you commit to handling it together. Just remember that it takes two willing participants to tango."
aries,2015-12-30,"There may be danger ahead if everything appears to glitter like gold in the sunlight. Nevertheless, it's still best to imagine the positive possibilities instead of focusing on the negative contingencies. Affirmations are extremely potent today, yet acknowledging what could go wrong enables you to recognize a problem before it becomes critical. Addressing the weakest part of your plan does not have to turn you into a pessimist. You create your future with every word you utter and every action you take."
taurus,2015-12-30,"Receiving long-overdue recognition from your coworkers or your boss is a sweet reward today. To add icing to the cake, a delayed raise or promotion could finally come through as you had hoped. Obviously, being appreciated for your contributions is heartwarming, but accepting praise might also be challenging now as your key planet Venus stumbles into suspicious Pluto. Nevertheless, succumbing to fear of success is a waste of your talent. Brush off your uncertainty, smile and proudly celebrate your accomplishments."
gemini,2015-12-30,"It's as easy as pie to start the day off right by conjuring up a fantastic plan, and then keep making it even bigger and better by increments. Unfortunately, your current desire to inflate nearly everything could turn a very sensible idea into a strategy that becomes so grandiose that it's impractical. A healthy helping of self-restraint is your key to satisfaction. Less is more is your mantra now, whether you like it or not."
cancer,2015-12-30,"You're so intuitive today that you can accidentally confuse an idealistic fantasy with reality. It requires constant vigilance to remain objective now, even if you have a plethora of facts at your disposal. But don't believe for a moment that you own a corner on the truth; even the most unbiased data can become tinted with subjective emotions. Color outside the lines when you dream about your ideal future. Just be sure to also pay close attention to your heart in the present moment."
leo,2015-12-30,"Distinguishing the real world from your subconscious mind is tricky today because the Moon's opposition to magical Neptune means the veil that separates these two worlds is very thin now. You are entering a creative zone, but the spirit realm feels so close that you could bump into a few ghosts of your own. At first, your visions might seem to have little in common with reality, but don't dismiss them prematurely. Ignoring your dreams can stifle your self-expression, while allowing your imagination to flow naturally should be enough to keep you inspired for weeks."
virgo,2015-12-30,"You might not be able to complete everything that you start today, even if you planned to work hard and stay late. Unfortunately, you may underestimate the time and resources necessary to finish your assignments. Managing your own disappointment will be challenging enough if you don't deliver what you promise, but dealing with others now is even harder. Thankfully, you can rely on your intuition while the Moon is in your sign. Stay alert like a fox, and don't make any commitments you can't keep."
libra,2015-12-30,"You are still walking a fine line, trying to juggle serious responsibilities with your optimistic hopes and dreams. However, you might be afraid of exhausting yourself now, since you know there's still more work coming your way. Perhaps you would be wise to squeeze in a bit of downtime while you can. Just remember, denial isn't a useful strategy, so be aware of the consequences of your choices before you land in trouble. You may not be able to plan for every contingency, but with a little luck you can shift the odds in your favor."
scorpio,2015-12-30,"Step back from your regular routine today so you can reevaluate your overall fiscal condition. Venus is traveling through your 2nd House of Personal Resources, giving you an opportunity to put your finances in order. But don't procrastinate, for it will take time to see the results of your current actions. At least make sure that your accounts are in order, bills are paid and you're ready for any unexpected expenses that may come your way. A little preparation now comes in handy on a rainy day."
sagittarius,2015-12-30,"Others don't know what to make of you when you're socially withdrawn, yet a recent contemplative phase is coming to a close. Vivacious Venus saunters into your sassy fire sign today for a three-week visit, boosting your charisma and emphasizing interpersonal dynamics. But your emotional intensity might be too much for others to handle. Thankfully, your feelings will become more manageable over the next week. Nevertheless, don't try to hide your changing moods; ultimately, expressing the truth as you experience it is all anyone can ask."
capricorn,2015-12-30,"Expecting too much from a coworker or loved one today can set the stage for major disappointment. Nevertheless, you probably won't be the one to drop the ball if you realistically assess what you can do before you begin. Even if you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings, over-committing isn't nice in the long run. Being totally honest is kinder on all involved than having to clean up a mess you make by promising the stars. Keep things simple and adopt an attitude of gratitude right from the start."
aquarius,2015-12-30,"Others see you as a positive force in their lives while charming Venus sets up camp in your 11th House of Social Networks. Even if you struggle with people's interference in your personal affairs, you can still project a cheerful image. Your friends are happy to see you doing so well now, but they don't know the entire story. Sharing your uncertainties may feel like a risky venture, but it can also remove barriers to cultivating deeper emotional connections. Strike while the iron is hot."
pisces,2015-12-30,"You might grow uneasy today if you're running into trouble maintaining meaningful boundaries. The Moon is shining her light in your 7th House of Relationships, attracting you to the emotional comfort of a partnership, but you also need your freedom, too. Don't be afraid to reassert your independence as long as you aren't trying to avoid an important issue. Consciously flowing with the currents should help to reduce the resistance to your opinions. Love is best given with no strings attached."
aries,2015-12-31,"Although you might not do anything special today, you will likely keep busy imagining the biggest and wildest party ever. Your visions can take you anywhere today as irrepressible Uranus excites pleasure-oriented Venus in your 9th House of Infinite Possibilities. But you may be able to satisfy your restlessness without all the fuss and drama, so don't risk everything trying to make your dreams come true yet. Knowing when to turn a fantasy into reality can make the difference between disappointment and happiness. Believe it or not, joy is within your grasp."
taurus,2015-12-31,"Your big ideas regarding a hot romance sound intriguing on paper, but they may quickly fade if you end up engaging in an emotional conflict with your love interest. You prefer an easygoing exchange of pleasantries before there's any mention of feelings, but you could be confronted with a radically different point of view today. Fortunately, you might just receive the intimate connection you are seeking if you possess the courage to stick around and stay present in the conversation.
