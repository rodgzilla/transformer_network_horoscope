SIGN,DATE,TEXT
aries,2011-01-01,"You are ready for the New Year and have great hopes for what's ahead. Although things may not take off right away, you can still turn this day into an exciting one. Even if you have made social commitments, be flexible enough to change your plans if something better comes your way. But it's not sufficient to only have a good time; you'll be happier if you can find an activity that also gives you a sense of purpose."
taurus,2011-01-01,"Keep your senses sharp today so you can distinguish between the exciting buzz that's growing in your life and your current temptation to jump into the future. But it's disconcerting if you cannot put your finger on the source of your current upbeat mood and your anticipation of what's ahead may be rather distracting. No matter how eager you are for something to happen, you still need to be patient. Discover the joy of the present moment, instead of waiting for the next event that rocks your world."
gemini,2011-01-01,"Although today is a holiday for most people, you might be moving so fast that you run into yourself returning from some destination you haven't yet reached. However, this type of altered reality isn't very useful, even if it allows you to amuse yourself with your cleverness. Ultimately, you are better off now by being a little more practical and a lot less of a trickster."
cancer,2011-01-01,"You are agitated today because you don't want to be constrained by your social obligations. Unfortunately, it's very hard now to focus on the tasks at hand. There may actually be too much happening in your life these days, which can leave you feeling overwhelmed. Remember, your emotional response can deplete your energy unless you are willing, on occasion, to address your own needs first."
leo,2011-01-01,"You're feeling quite creative, but you might be more interested in watching a football game today than doing something productive. Nevertheless, it's difficult for you to just let go of your routine responsibilities. Once you step beyond your current world, your life becomes more fun because anything can happen. However, the window of opportunity won't stay open long; jump out while you can."
virgo,2011-01-01,"Your thoughts are scattered today, yet fortunately, it's easy to hide your nervous energy. You are tempted to voice your opinion and let everyone know why you're unwilling to go along with the plan. However, you'll be happier now if you can let go of your compulsive need to be in control. Instead, focus on whatever task seems to be the highest priority. When you're done with that, consider what comes next. Baby steps will lead to success."
libra,2011-01-01,"Although you still have a number of chores at home to finish today, your positive approach will likely help you to reduce your workload. But you might not be able to stay focused on your agenda because everyone else's plans seem to be more interesting. Nevertheless, the grass is not always greener on the other side of the fence; continuing with your priorities should make for a workable strategy."
scorpio,2011-01-01,"Your thoughts can definitely have a direct impact on your finances today. But contrary to some New Age theories, visualizing your new car or house isn't sufficient to make one appear. However, there is a direct relationship between your self-esteem and your earning potential, so find time to uncover any emotional blocks that are still in the way of your prosperity."
sagittarius,2011-01-01,"Your current self-confidence may not last forever, but you still can use it today to put critical events into motion. Your eclectic approach to a difficult situation may lead to some of your acquaintances disapproving of your lifestyle choices. However, if you can learn to trust your own instincts, rather than worrying about peer feedback, you could be thrilled by the results."
capricorn,2011-01-01,"You may be so entrenched in your current lifestyle that it takes a sudden surprise to wake you from your sleep. If you have grown rigid about what you want to do, it might be time now for serious reevaluation. Self-examination won't be easy, but it's worthwhile if you learn to shed the limitations you've placed on yourself. Fasten your seatbelt; your income potential is on the rise and your life is about to change."
aquarius,2011-01-01,"You can be so distracted by your involvement in the lives of others that you inadvertently let your own obligations slip. But nothing is to be gained at this time by placing your needs subservient to the common good. This type of community-oriented thinking is admirable, but now it stands between you and your personal growth. Being a little selfish today can be quite beneficial to others in the future."
pisces,2011-01-01,"You may feel as if others aren't noticing you today, and it's doubly frustrating because you have something important to say. However, your current feeling of invisibility may be due to your lack of assertion. Push through your fears of rejection, even if it seems like no one appreciates your extra effort. Sometimes taking care of everyone else can leave you exhausted. Don't rely on getting approval for your actions; just listen to your instincts and do what feels natural."
aries,2011-01-02,"You may be eager to start a new project, but it's crucial that your impulsiveness doesn't tempt you to jump the gun. It's better to wait a while before you take your best shot. Don't worry about falling behind; instead, use your time to build a stronger foundation on which your future work can stand. Progress may be slow now, but today's efforts will be appreciated in a week or two."
taurus,2011-01-02,"You are balancing two different strategies today. You know that rushing forward isn't a smart idea now, and you are willing to wait longer before taking your plans to the next level. However, you are seeing signs that indicate taking immediate action is better than doing nothing, in spite of being hesitant about plowing ahead. Even if you're tempted to throw caution to the wind, patience is still your key to success. There's no need to be in such a hurry."
gemini,2011-01-02,"You may set your pace early in the day, but everyone seems to be telling you to move faster. Meanwhile, your intuition is advising you to slow down. Paradoxically, you won't require more time to reach your goal if you don't work so quickly now. Sometimes finding your own rhythm is more efficient than speeding your way through your chores and then having to redo them later."
cancer,2011-01-02,"You normally don't want to be involved in a conflict if someone is trying to outsmart you with logic. However, you may need to be more assertive today if others attempt to make decisions for you. You are completely capable of arriving at a sensible conclusion without help from anyone else, and acquiescing power could undermine your authority later on. Grandiose gestures are in style now, so don't limit your thinking. If you must set boundaries to keep people out of your personal life, do it in a respectful and kind manner."
leo,2011-01-02,"You can continue on your creative roll today, but you must watch your current tendency to overindulge your senses. It's absolutely crucial now to think about what you are going to say before you blurt out your thoughts. Self-restraint may not sound like a lot of fun, but an awkward situation could throw a monkey wrench into the works if you don't practice moderation."
virgo,2011-01-02,"You may face another round of an all too familiar issue today as your ability to wait until the right moment is tested. Thankfully, your pragmatic perspective won't fail you now. You instinctively know to steer clear of opportunities with no downside. It's better to experience the shadow (or, at least, to recognize that one is lurking nearby) than to mistakenly believe that all is well. A serious reality check should save you from any disillusionment tomorrow."
libra,2011-01-02,"You can feel that something exciting is right around the next corner. You are ready for some sort of catalyst to shake your life loose, but may not know what it is yet. Needless to say, this makes it difficult, if not impossible, to prepare for what's coming up. Your best strategy is to keep reminding yourself to stay in the present moment so that you don't miss opportunity knocking at your door."
scorpio,2011-01-02,"Hard work doesn't intimidate you, and you might even be looking forward to showing others what you can do now. Luckily, you have an ace up your sleeve and could surprise anyone who thinks you might fail. You are capable of being productive beyond everyone's expectations today. Don't be concerned about receiving positive feedback; the rewards will be well worth the wait."
sagittarius,2011-01-02,"Everyone seems okay about moving into new territory today, yet your natural impatience makes you happiest when you are running ahead of the pack. Although you haven't been here before, you're not willing to slow down enough to let logic be your guide. Even if you're working on pure instinct now, don't close yourself off to valuable advice if it comes your way."
capricorn,2011-01-02,"You may be sad that the holidays are coming to an end, especially if you are uncertain about the upcoming year. One strategy is to bolt ahead as if you know where you're going. Another approach may be to slow down or even coast while you figure it all out. Set your discouragement aside and focus on the most amazing outcome possible. Even if you aren't progressing as fast as you wish, rest assured you are moving toward your goals and will reach them sooner than you think."
aquarius,2011-01-02,"You may feel disappointed now, yet you don't want to share your thoughts with anyone else. It's not that you're a pessimist; it's just that you are able to anticipate potential problems and this perspective can be discouraging. Nevertheless, there's no need to fritter your energy away by expressing negativity. Do your best to analyze the current situation, make any necessary changes and then move along. There's no point in wasting time when there are so many positive things you can do."
pisces,2011-01-02,"You are standing at the edge of a canyon and there's no apparent way across to the other side. Nevertheless, your vivid imagination is running on overdrive now and you may believe that jumping or flying is a viable option. Fortunately, you have the sense not to get carried away with an unrealistic dream. Instead of rushing the looming transition, return to your checklist and go over the details one last time before blasting ahead."
aries,2011-01-03,"You often will wait until the last minute and then squeak in under a deadline. But every moment counts now, so you would be wise to make an effort to find your stride early on today. The sooner you begin a project, the longer you'll be able to sustain your high level of productivity. Starting off quickly makes sense only if you're then willing to slow down and work steadily toward your goal."
taurus,2011-01-03,"You are ready for your next great adventure, and the lessons you learn today can be very helpful later on. There are few limits on what is possible now once you make up your mind to initiate action. There's no need to fear big thinking as long as you're willing to bring your ideas down to a very practical level."
gemini,2011-01-03,"You are determined to get to the bottom of a mystery that's intrigued you for a while. But this isn't about a passing whim; you are fully committed to understanding your feelings, even if it takes longer than you expect. Although you could be motivated by unrealistic values, you don't have to let go of what's meaningful to you. Set your priorities and then bring your most important ideals down to earth."
cancer,2011-01-03,"Your boss or some other authority may be critical of your easygoing approach to work today. However, you're wise to listen carefully to what you are told, even if you're tempted to ignore the feedback. Learning a lesson from someone who is a harsh taskmaster can be challenging because you might want to withdraw and avoid what feels like a personal attack. Nevertheless, staying open to others now can teach you how to improve your game and be even more productive."
leo,2011-01-03,"Although you may be tempted to escape into a lovely fantasy now, you need to be more focused than ever. Your unfettered dreams can help you be more confident, but they are also a distraction from the serious work at hand. You might not want to pay attention to the details, but overcoming your own resistance is the first step toward reaching your goals in the weeks ahead."
virgo,2011-01-03,"Establishing a consistent work pace is crucial now, for uneven progress can set you up for failure. Luckily, your perceptions are quite sharp and you can accurately estimate the time and resources required to finish a task. Prioritizing your goals is a good place to start. Once you have a practical strategy, you won't need to hold yourself back. Effective planning will allow you to reach your dreams sooner than you think."
libra,2011-01-03,"You are certain about your goals now because you have a strong sense of purpose. You know what you want to do and a few obstacles won't prevent you from reaching your destination. Still, you'll need to be careful so unrealistic fantasies don't lure you off the main path. Avoid complexity; the simpler your plan, the more you'll be able to trust your intuition."
scorpio,2011-01-03,"Your ideas can be so outrageous today that it's difficult to tell if they are based on reality or fantasy. It's important to distinguish between the two, for you must temporarily set aside your unrealizable dreams so you can accomplish something that has lasting value now. Creating an action plan is not enough; you must take the next step and do something about it. However, it's not helpful to attempt too much all at once. Many manageable steps are better than one spontaneous leap forward."
sagittarius,2011-01-03,"It may be easy for you to assume a significant amount of control today, but over-managing a situation could lead to a mess. Instead, loosening the reins will encourage others to play a more significant role in the decision-making process. Allowing your co-workers to share leadership responsibilities can make tough obstacles easier to overcome. Slow down and proceed with caution until you get the green light."
capricorn,2011-01-03,"Nothing is simple now with so many planets traveling through your hardworking sign. The weight of the world is sitting on your shoulders and you're growing weary of supporting everyone else. However, you don't have to accept the authoritative role that's being placed on you. Show your wisdom by encouraging others to discover their own paths to success. Even if you think that you know best, it will be even better when everyone is motivated to work together."
aquarius,2011-01-03,"Your dreams are steering you toward practical solutions today as the serious Capricorn Moon visits your 12th House of Imagination, bringing your fantasies down to earth. But trying to hold on to old assumptions could stand between you and any future success. Practice trusting your intuition now, for it will guide you toward your new destination."
pisces,2011-01-03,"The Moon's entry into your 11th House of Long-Term Goals tempts you to dream about the distant future instead of focusing on important events right now. But this isn't time to kick back and let your imagination take you on a magic carpet ride. Instead, be proactive and seize the moment. You have an opportunity to rebuild your life one concrete step at a time. Planning is useful as long as you are willing to get to work right away."
aries,2011-01-04,"Unexpected developments at work lead to a whole new set of possibilities as today's Solar Eclipse rattles your 10th House of Career. You are ready to take on a big challenge, partly because you might underestimate the amount of work that will be required to complete a project. However, if you can keep your fantasies from distorting the facts, you will have an excellent chance to make your dreams come true. Reach outside the box, but don't lose your common sense."
taurus,2011-01-04,"A co-worker may oppose your efforts today as the Solar Eclipse stirs up resistance in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Instead of stubbornly fighting back to deal with the obstacles that surface now, try working with others to improve your plan. You have an opportunity to break out of a rut, but you won't be able to do it alone. Cooperation, not conflict, will lead to success."
gemini,2011-01-04,"You mean business today and, fortunately, have a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your sound logic and emotional depth. Others won't be able to marginalize your ideas, especially if they are well thought out and built on sound assumptions. Taking a calculated risk can bring rewards beyond your wildest expectations, but you'll still have to work hard to receive the payoff."
cancer,2011-01-04,"A relationship that usually seems safe may test your limits today as you struggle to redefine your boundaries. Normally, you don't like feeling insecure, but you may enjoy the adrenaline rush now, especially if you're riding a wave of self-confidence. Blind optimism will surely land you in trouble, so make sure that you balance your hopes and dreams with the common sense and advice that others bring to you."
leo,2011-01-04,"You are quite serious about setting new goals today and you probably think that there isn't anything that can distract you from your self-appointed path. Fortunately, good ideas roll though your mind now like waves crashing on a beach. Nevertheless, you can grow so enamored with one amazing thought after another that you are hypnotized by all that's possible. Visionary thinking may be uplifting yet unsatisfying, unless you keep reminding yourself to be productive in the process."
virgo,2011-01-04,"You have a lot to do today and you are eager to jump in and get started. The ambitious Capricorn Solar Eclipse creates movement in your 5th House of Self-Expression, encouraging you to show others how your artistic skills can lend support to an important project or business venture. Don't be surprised if someone likes your work so much that he or she becomes your greatest supporter. Try not to make assumptions about the roles that your allies can play. If another person wants to help, graciously accept the offer with a smile."
libra,2011-01-04,"Your key planet Venus has been adding intensity to your life as she travels through passionate Scorpio -- maybe even creating too much drama for your preferred even-keeled manner. Today, however, Venus empowers you with a magical trine to independent Uranus and confident Jupiter. Taking the proverbial bull by the horns might sound like a crazy idea, but it just may be the strategy you need at this moment."
scorpio,2011-01-04,"Your attempts to slow the pace of communication today may be too little and too late. A recurring conversation could feel like a runaway rollercoaster car, but you may not notice how far off track it's going until you try to stop the ride so you can get off. Panic feeds fear, but, thankfully, deep breathing can bring you back to your center. Be aware that every word you speak resonates with more intention than you realize."
sagittarius,2011-01-04,"Don't try to shift the responsibility for your unhappiness onto an unstable situation at home. Your key planet Jupiter joins futuristic Uranus in your 4th House of Roots to blast you out of the status quo. Consider what you want and express your needs with honesty and kindness now. You should get an energetic boost from the New Moon Eclipse in your 2nd House of Self-Worth, provoking you to take a risk to achieve something that's important to you."
capricorn,2011-01-04,"It's difficult now for you to escape the same dynamic changes that you successfully already postponed once or twice before. But today's Solar Eclipse in your sign is dynamically squaring your ruling planet, Saturn the Taskmaster, extracting an extra share of blood, sweat and tears. No matter what, you have to work very hard now for everything you want. Although you may be very successful, your efforts might not pay off the way you expect."
aquarius,2011-01-04,"Your key planet Uranus is erratic and sometimes irrepressible. Today, it's conjunction with expansive Jupiter in your 2nd House of Money suggests a possible windfall or a sudden change of fortune. But even if good news comes your way in the form of a financial reward, the benefits might not last if you're careless. Avoid the easy-come, easy-go trap by moderating your spending patterns. Although you cannot buy your way to happiness, you can create emotional prosperity by sharing your ideas with your friends."
pisces,2011-01-04,"Sensuous Venus aspects both of your key planets, Jupiter and Neptune, today, increasing your optimism while tempting you to escape into a fantasy world. Meanwhile, the dutiful Capricorn Solar Eclipse in your 11th House of Future Goals requires a cautious and conservative approach to all social and professional interactions. Fortunately, you are flexible enough to maintain your composure in the middle of this dynamic time."
aries,2011-01-05,"You might try a variety of tactics to achieve your goals today, yet you still may be frustrated that things don't happen as fast as you wish. Surrounding yourself with supportive colleagues and loyal friends can help you to keep your energy positive. Although relying on others isn't necessarily a permanent solution, losing yourself in a group of like-minded people can temporarily reduce your self-made pressure to succeed."
taurus,2011-01-05,"You may be quite enamored with the idea of going back to school to open your eyes to a new way of thinking. However, even studying something like philosophy must have a more practical side, too, or it won't keep your interest. Instead of making a long-term commitment, you might be satisfied by traveling to someplace new. Anything that takes your mind far away now can add more meaning to your life."
gemini,2011-01-05,"You are the curious type, yet now your need for more information can become an obsession about a foreign destination or a radical world view. These subjects have a common thread in that they can pull you out beyond the edges of your present worries. Nevertheless, escaping your current obligations won't come without a personal cost. Although you may want to commit to a lifelong dream, make sure you finish something tangible today, too."
cancer,2011-01-05,"You are very realistic today, but this won't stop you from creating opportunities out of a chance meeting. If someone opens a door for you, don't be afraid to walk through to the other side. Even if a co-worker criticizes you, make sure to closely listen to what is being said so you can respond accordingly. But this is not only about having a good time; find an adventure that encourages your growth without wasting your energy on a wild goose chase."
leo,2011-01-05,"It's all about everyone else in your life now that the Moon is in your 7th House of Relationships. You don't exist in a void; there must be an easy rhythm to your life, so you can dance through your day with a partner. But progress could be very slow; don't worry if it seems like you're not gaining any ground. The leap ahead will happen before you know it."
virgo,2011-01-05,"You are the King or Queen of Paradoxes today because you are very positive about the potential of any scenario now, no matter what the circumstances. Fortunately, you're not willing to follow someone into a nebulous fantasy that originates from sloppy thinking. Ultimately, your commitment to the truth cannot be set aside. Consider all the possibilities, make a choice and then live with your decision."
libra,2011-01-05,"It's difficult for you to understand where your great inspiration comes from today, yet a fresh wind is blowing in this new year. Your muse may be encouraging you to manifest something beautiful, but you could still struggle with the act of creation. No matter how out of place you might feel, take the ideas that come to you now and work them into everything you create."
scorpio,2011-01-05,"You may be feeling very protective of your feelings now. With a pile of planets clustered in your subjective 3rd and 4th houses today, it may be challenging to take what you learn and turn it into something productive. Even if your attitude begins to improve this afternoon, it's still wise to take it easy instead of doing work, work and more work."
sagittarius,2011-01-05,"You may spend a lot of time questioning your own emotionally-detached style of intellectual inquiry today. Your current stress can motivate you to turn your ideas into a new source of income and blissfully do what you love to do most. Act as fluidly as you can because the cosmic weather is shifting. Still, it's more comfortable to go with the flow for a while than attempting to hold on to your predetermined course."
capricorn,2011-01-05,"Your best ideas are being co-opted by a group of very smart people, and you may need to fight for your point of view every step of the way now. Holding on to the status quo may seem more important than looking forward to what is next. Keep in mind that fear of the future is not a healthy motivator. If you are frightened of the intensity, work on transforming negativity into hope and love."
aquarius,2011-01-05,"You are optimistic about your future, even if you feel as if there's still a lot of hard work to do. But your inner fears and complex changes could remain invisible to others; they may not even realize that you're going through a powerful process unless you go out of your way to tell them. Save your meaningful self-disclosure until you know exactly where you are going."
pisces,2011-01-05,"You may receive an income boost today and, thankfully, every little bit helps. Fortunately, this isn't an ethereal buzz that materializes from a different dimension. Financial advice that can have an immediate and positive impact on your day comes to you in the form of a concrete suggestion from someone you know. But don't be content to stick with one approach. It makes good sense now to keep a few extra irons in the fire."
aries,2011-01-06,"Undertaking a new activity is often your idea of a fun time. Even if you feel the need to get something accomplished today, you are still in a relatively expansive period. You may not be panicking because the deadlines aren't close enough yet. Don't become overly complacent; a systematic narrowing of your field of vision could help you focus on what needs to happen next."
taurus,2011-01-06,"It's rather straightforward for you to draw the line today as you set clear boundaries and make plans for your future. However, you have such an inflated idea about what you want to do that you can get carried away with your own enthusiasm. Even if everything seems to be in order, the trouble starts when you realize that you may be overshooting your mark. Working harder now won't make you more successful, so you might just as well ease up and relax."
gemini,2011-01-06,"Even if you are thinking about what you need to do at work today, a lack of time could force you to scale back your plans. Still, your communication with someone who is opposed to your strategy can reveal the weakest links in your ideas. You can, however, stay on top of everything if you remember that your fuse is short. Losing your temper won't get you any closer to your goals."
cancer,2011-01-06,"You may convince yourself not to share your feelings now, but this isn't a viable long-term strategy. Sometimes, it's just easier to keep everything to yourself. But this isn't about taking the course of least resistance, because anything that isn't said now will only strengthen in intensity. You will still need to deal with your feelings eventually; if you keep your emotions hidden, they will just turn up as a projection. Your smartest defense is to react honestly and kindly in the present moment."
leo,2011-01-06,"Your attempts to be emotionally open could backfire on you in a frustrating manner today, especially if you realize that you were overly optimistic. Perhaps you missed a signal or simply didn't want to acknowledge someone's pessimism, especially when you were feeling so good. Balance your desires with a realistic perspective in order to prevent disappointment in the upcoming days."
virgo,2011-01-06,"Although you may think that you are concentrating on your work, you're probably having a hard time preventing your thoughts from being carried away by the crazy schemes of your friends or coworkers. In fact, your attraction to the most outrageous ideas could actually be a reflection of your current boredom. Don't pretend that everything's fine if it isn't. Seek constructive ways to shake up your routine before you feel really stuck."
libra,2011-01-06,"You may be feeling quite confident today which could make you slightly careless in your actions. However, you can minimize your chances of making a mistake by remembering to concentrate on your work as you are doing it. If you are certain that everything you start now will be great, it won't be. But if you maintain humility, your creative powers are free to manifest at a very productive level."
scorpio,2011-01-06,"You may believe that an opportunity for a friendship should be allowed to float by without any action on your part. Even if you are worried about feeling unnecessary emotional pain now, it's still worth overcoming your fears, taking a risk and reaching out. Your silence will ultimately be more painful than any vulnerability you might feel in the moment."
sagittarius,2011-01-06,"An unstable situation at home is beginning to settle down. But someone might just do something so out of character today that you don't know how to respond. You might choose to withdraw now and take care of some personal issues that have needed your attention for a while. Do what must be done, but don't fall into the trap of taking on so much that you don't produce the quality of work that you prefer to deliver."
capricorn,2011-01-06,"This is a very serious time in your life, and you aren't willing to let others define who you are and where you're going. Unfortunately, in standing up for yourself, you may upset someone more than you realize. Everything might be blown out of proportion today, making you believe that you have more at stake than you actually do. Nevertheless, a little risk-taking will be positively rewarded."
aquarius,2011-01-06,"Boisterous Jupiter is still within range of its conjunction with your key planet Uranus, provoking you to forget about your long-term goals and to take immediate action to get fast results. However, the problem is that you're working on something big that may need more time yet to reach fruition. Don't hurry the process. Let things unfold naturally."
pisces,2011-01-06,"You appear a bit less stable than you actually are these days with Jupiter, your traditional ruling planet, conjunct outrageous Uranus. But your unorthodox behavior may only be superficial because down deep you know that the rules and regulations of Saturn must be acknowledged and obeyed. Nevertheless, you must be careful now; if you inadvertently step over the line of acceptability, you'll need to make amends quickly."
aries,2011-01-07,"Although you are eager to start planning for a new adventure, you need to learn a tough lesson before you bolt ahead. Instead of turning this into a major problem by fighting against the inevitable, slow down and take the time to consider why you may be running into obstacles now. Don't try to overpower the facts with your good intentions. Once you accept the truth, you'll be allowed to move forward."
taurus,2011-01-07,"Your key planet Venus tempts you with a taste of what's possible, but you might not be able to proceed as quickly as you would like. There's nothing wrong with letting your desires motivate you as long as they are realistic. But you may be under a lot of pressure if you have underestimated the amount of time that you'll need to complete a job. Don't make any promises you cannot keep; it's better to disappoint someone with the honest truth today than to be the source of disappointment later on."
gemini,2011-01-07,"You may be able to talk a serious game today, but when push comes to shove, you're not as interested in following through with the necessary actions. Nevertheless, it's a smart idea to think about the consequences of irresponsible behavior before you try to tap dance your way out of an uncomfortable position. Fortunately, expressing your feelings in a mature manner can turn an uncomfortable situation into a positive one."
cancer,2011-01-07,"You might not be very gung-ho about the potential of a current relationship, yet your avoidance of the truth will only complicate matters. Granted, one strategy is to go ahead and focus on the unrealized potential, but gambling on the future won't resolve the tension in the present. Sharing what's on your mind with kindness can open the door to a much-needed conversation and a new level of intimacy."
leo,2011-01-07,"You may have a lot of work on your plate today, yet unforeseen events pull your attention away from your goals and impede your progress. The pressure to finish your tasks can create additional stress if you do fall behind schedule. Nevertheless, your fear of what others might say is more disruptive to your productivity than anything else. Rest assured that doing your best now will be more than good enough."
virgo,2011-01-07,"You've been riding a wave of creative energy that continues to be difficult to manifest. It's as if your productive ideas are blocked by circumstances that are beyond your control. But don't give up. Instead of logically trying to analyze all your options, let your imagination be your guide. For now, dreaming your way into the future is more powerful than scripting it."
libra,2011-01-07,"You could be your own worst enemy today, succumbing to feelings of self-doubt, even if they are unwarranted. This isn't to suggest that all criticism should be ignored; it's just that your heightened sensitivity can make things seem worse than they actually are. Instead of fantasizing about what could go wrong, direct your mind to visualize what could go right."
scorpio,2011-01-07,"The most intelligent way to assure that you'll get everything done today is to write down all your appointments and responsibilities and then juggle everything into a schedule that maximizes your efficiency. But no matter how well you plan your day, you still need to leave room for things taking longer than you expect. Although you are able to work hard, it's also important to know when to toss in the towel. If something goes awry, you can always come back to fix it later on."
sagittarius,2011-01-07,"Sweet Venus is your ally today as she enters your confident sign to help ameliorate somber Saturn's temporary hold on you. But this isn't about slipping into denial to avoid a hard lesson or extra work; it's about motivating yourself to act in a positive manner while still acknowledging the constraints that are placed on you by judgmental friends or a lack of resources. Instead of aiming for an unrealistic goal, choose a destination that's within reach."
capricorn,2011-01-07,"The willful Sun runs into a square with your key planet Saturn today, testing your ability to live up to your commitments. It's easy to get so excited that you believe you can defend your actions, but the ends don't justify the means. Your good intentions won't be sufficient now to overcome a bad judgment call or a misdirected use of authority. Forget about taking any shortcuts; instead, do what's expected of you with determination and grace."
aquarius,2011-01-07,"There's little margin for error today, so don't let your changing moods influence your actions. Acknowledging your feelings is one thing, but allowing your emotions to control your behavior now is not a good idea. Taking a few deep breaths before you do anything impulsively should give you sufficient time to rationally analyze your next move."
pisces,2011-01-07,"You might believe that it's in your best interest to avoid a discussion about your feelings today, but it's better to face the truth head-on than let it gnaw away at your confidence. You can broach nearly any subject if you approach it with kindness. However, with your imagination so active, it's crucial to stick with the facts. Save the dreaming for another day when there's not so much at stake."
aries,2011-01-08,"Today you have more options than usual because you're not restrained by reality. Although your fantasies might seem far out to others, you are capable of extraordinary accomplishments if you can concentrate on your ambitions. Nevertheless, it is wiser to include a practical perspective. Keeping your feet on the ground will give you the necessary traction to reach for the stars."
taurus,2011-01-08,"You may feel anxious today as your desires pull you into new territory while your common sense holds you in your current position. You're motivated by emotional and financial security, but you are still intrigued by a distant horizon. Even if you decide to further explore the unknown, don't abandon your present routine. Thankfully, you don't need to turn your life upside down in order to progress toward the future."
gemini,2011-01-08,"You may feel quite clever today, as if you took a smart pill that boosted your intelligence quotient. However, it's not a good idea to become too attached to your ability to think your way through any problem because rational thinking is a trap of its own. Don't rely on logic now; instead, try a different path into the future by allowing your intuition to take you for a ride."
cancer,2011-01-08,"You may be tempted to retreat into a fantasy world today as your thoughts float into imaginative realms where you are not bound by facts. Although anything is possible in your dreams, you can't avoid your closest friends and family who keep guiding you back to the present moment, making it impossible for you to fully escape. Accept that you must live in two worlds now and seek balance between objective circumstances and your subjective inner life."
leo,2011-01-08,"You may have a cool and detached attitude now that enables you to see the world differently. Although your interpersonal connections can be a source of anxiety, you don't need to let this lead you down a path of self-doubt. Stepping outside of your normal subjectivity gives you a new perspective. But don't make any significant changes yet; instead, be content with assimilating your current lessons into what you already know."
virgo,2011-01-08,"You may be thinking about improving your daily regimen, but could get sidetracked by worrying about the impact your lifestyle changes can have on someone else. Being sensitive to those close to you is important. Instead of just imagining the consequences of your actions, make a list of all the ways -- pros and cons -- that others could respond to your actions. Preemptively discussing the most significant potential problems could be enough to minimize any possible negativity before it manifests."
libra,2011-01-08,"You may have clarity around which chores you should do today, but this doesn't mean that you'll actually get them done. Even if you were planning on starting a project around the house, you could end up deciding that it's more important to give yourself a day off. Nevertheless, it's better if you're able to get into a creative flow and be productive in some way. If you have trouble settling down, engage in physical exercise to expend your excess energy."
scorpio,2011-01-08,"The intensity in your relationships continues to settle down today, but you cannot totally control all your reactions to what happens in your immediate environment. Although you're not looking for a melodrama, you don't want to hide the facts as you see them. Unfortunately, your unwillingness to play games now could make you seem less compassionate. Don't judge yourself harshly if you prefer nothing but the truth."
sagittarius,2011-01-08,"You may be feeling less certain about a recent decision, as today's events test your ability to maintain your integrity. You may feel like you know what's right in your heart, even if it doesn't necessarily agree with your logical conclusion. Making a choice can be stressful now. However, going along with the majority is easier if you feel like part of the family or group. Determine what works best for you and then stick with it."
capricorn,2011-01-08,"The spacey Pisces Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication this weekend, encouraging you to ramble on about whatever's on your mind. Although you might think that you're being sensitive to the needs of others, you're tempted to railroad right over their protests without even realizing what you're doing. It's great if you are eager to share your thoughts as long as you know when to quit. Conversations are fine, but all talk and no action doesn't really get you anywhere."
aquarius,2011-01-08,"Although you can be quite clever, don't put too much stock in finding a verbal solution to a social situation today. Your ability to turn on the charm now is a mixed blessing, for it also allows you to evade an important issue by dancing around it. Acknowledging your vulnerability with someone you trust is much better than acting like a know-it-all. When you admit that you don't have all the answers, then others feel like they have something to offer you for a change."
pisces,2011-01-08,"The Moon's return to your sensitive sign enables you to be a kinder and gentler person. However, it also can bring on self-doubt as you see a gulf between your current situation and your ideal life. Thankfully, the choice is yours; practice compassion or allow discouragement to stop you from opening your heart. As you choose your response, remember that you're also choosing your future."
aries,2011-01-09,"Although you may be discouraged today, you're not ready to give up hope. You believe that good news is just around the next corner and it will override whatever troubles you're now encountering. But don't try to hide your current dissatisfaction, because telling the truth can be the catalyst you need that breaks you out of a rut. Shaking things up might be exactly what the doctor ordered."
taurus,2011-01-09,"You could be surprised by the power of your reactions today because you thought you were okay with the way everything was progressing. If you are involved in a family matter or a group decision, it may be impossible to keep your emotions hidden from everyone else. Don't try to withhold your feelings, even if it means that you could be marginalized or even excluded by others. Remember, maintaining your integrity is always more important than receiving peer approval."
gemini,2011-01-09,"It's challenging for you to express your freedom today because meeting your obligations now is more critical than pursuing pleasure. Keep in mind that whatever you choose to do, the outcome won't be exactly what you expect. Ultimately, escaping responsibilities for the day won't be as much fun as you think, so it's wise to postpone playtime for now."
cancer,2011-01-09,"You might as well accept the fact that you're going to run into some old and familiar obstacles today that can get in the way of your personal plans. You may have imagined a perfect scenario for the day, only to find that your feelings aren't following the logical agenda created in your head. However, if you're flexible and can let go of your previous expectations, you should be able to make real progress on the home front."
leo,2011-01-09,"If you made promises to someone, they must be acknowledged now, even if there are pieces of the puzzle that are still missing. It's hard to know how to manage the current situation until you've gathered all the facts. Unfortunately, even if you're not ready, you can't get away with doing nothing today, so be prepared to make a choice based on the information you already have. You can always change your mind later if you learn something new."
virgo,2011-01-09,"You may be expecting a surprise, but the real news is that nothing very exciting happens today. Fortunately, you can have a good time anyway, but your emotions will be somewhat subdued. Withholding your reactions and displaying an even-keeled front so as not to interfere with your plans can be a successful strategy now, as long as you also pay attention to your changing moods."
libra,2011-01-09,"A break in your routine can bring you a sense of exhilaration as you are released from the boredom of your work. Unfortunately, you may have a tough time determining a new course of action, rather than continuing your regularly scheduled activities. Don't worry too much about what you should be doing; let your heart, not other people's expectations, guide you through the day."
scorpio,2011-01-09,"You may be anticipating a creative burst of energy to turn your day into something special today. But the lightning might not strike until tomorrow, leaving you unsatisfied for now. Meanwhile, an unexpected chore could be dropped in your lap and you'll have to spend your extra time working, rather than playing. Don't waste too much energy fighting against the inevitable or you'll be too tired to enjoy yourself when the time finally does arrive."
sagittarius,2011-01-09,"You might not be a lot of fun today, making others wonder if they did something to upset you. The truth is that you aren't looking forward to the work week. You don't want things to continue in the same old way; you may even want to shake up your routine simply for the sake of change. However, it's not a good time to push the envelope too quickly. You're better off being patient until tomorrow."
capricorn,2011-01-09,"Your responsibilities may be complicated by contradictory obligations that you've made to different people. Although you're often able to simplify chaos, today it's not so easy to reduce the complexity into a manageable course of action. Acknowledge that you cannot be everything to everyone. Set new priorities and let others know what you can and cannot do. Ultimately, you'll be more appreciated for your honesty than your productivity."
aquarius,2011-01-09,"Your impulsive decisions will likely upset someone enough that he or she could turn from an ally into an enemy. But don't fight back or things will just become even more complicated. Thankfully, you can be successful if you avoid direct confrontation for a little while longer. Distancing yourself from the situation will provide you with a much-needed fresh perspective."
pisces,2011-01-09,"You may be unsure of how to express yourself within the context of relationships today, especially if others are withholding their emotions. Although tense situations sometimes require extreme reactions, losing your temper won't solve anything now. Be as diplomatic as possible in your approach; making everyone's life easier will also improve your own."
aries,2011-01-10,"The dark skies suddenly clear today and you are ready to rock and roll. Although the Moon's return to your sign can infuse you with confidence, it's still a good idea to think before you swing into action. Being sure of yourself is better than feeling discouraged, but it could provoke you to take a foolish risk when you're better off waiting for a more reliable opportunity."
taurus,2011-01-10,"You have more going on today than meets the eye. Paradoxically, you may feel as if you're being forthright, but there's a lot you are still not saying. Or, the words you're using to describe your inner process are so vague that no one really knows what's going on for you now. There's nothing to be gained by being evasive, so you might as well go the extra mile and clearly express what's on your mind."
gemini,2011-01-10,"Your key planet Mercury raises the stakes today as it heightens your anxiety and oddly enough also soothes your nerves. Unfortunately, you might not be satisfied with experiencing the tension and relaxation at the same time. Nevertheless, if you can find some comfort while your thoughts are bouncing around all over the place, then you'll be okay wherever you are."
cancer,2011-01-10,"Everything is popping at work today and you are enthusiastic about your role in what's happening. However, it's challenging to know which thoughts are vital to your next project because you are coming up with so many ideas that you lose the ability to prioritize them. Although you may feel inspired to be more spontaneous now, balancing your current need for action with your long-term goals is a smarter strategy."
leo,2011-01-10,"It's challenging for you to pay enough attention to your feelings so that you don't slip into denial today. But it's not that you're unaware of your emotions; you're just not sufficiently comfortable to completely let go of your past. Once you are able to accept your personal history, it will be easier for you to create your future."
virgo,2011-01-10,"Trickster Mercury is your key planet and today he's simultaneously stirring the cosmic energy in different directions. Mercury's sextile to dreamy Neptune enables you to express your vision poetically or artistically. However, Mercury's high-anxiety square with erratic Uranus symbolizes emotional instability. Don't make commitments now if you aren't clear about the consequences."
libra,2011-01-10,"Relationships can be on very tricky ground today as you are required to react with your feelings before you apply any logic to the situation. You may be feeling more confident now about others, but you still aren't so sure of yourself that you'll risk what you've already gained. Nevertheless, if you aren't willing to gamble with your heart, you'll never discover the potential that is yours."
scorpio,2011-01-10,"Your daily routine can get out of hand today because there are so many new facets to your schedule. Unfortunately, you cannot make any of your chores disappear; you must find time for each and every one. A radical approach to an old familiar job can be so exciting that it ends up costing you time and money. Fooling yourself can be just as bad as fooling someone else."
sagittarius,2011-01-10,"You can justify nearly anything that sounds like fun today, but you aren't motivated to deliver any diplomatic dissertations. Rather than becoming all hot under the collar and ranting about your pet peeve, apply your energy toward your own personal retreat. You might miss the excitement of a social engagement or a party, but the satisfaction of personal growth will prove to be an enduring memory."
capricorn,2011-01-10,"Although you may be tempted to jump today because you believe that your wings will appear just in time, blind faith is not a very smart strategy. Fantasies based upon your ideas often help you push a little further and reach a bit higher, but they can also set you up for disappointment. Keep your most extreme feelings to yourself in order to minimize any discouragement."
aquarius,2011-01-10,"You are overwhelmed with new ideas today, and it may not be so easy to integrate thoughts that are on the cutting edge. But instead of paving well-worn streets to make them smoother, you are exploring where there are no roads at all. Don't worry about trying to get all the pieces of the puzzle to fit together seamlessly. Instead, think of yourself as a scout, out in front of the pack. Just let others know what you see and then let them put it all together into a tidy package."
pisces,2011-01-10,"You may have a new way to look at an existing problem at work today, but be careful about misleading yourself with a solution that's too good to be true. Although you might understand how the big picture works, it's still not easy to put all the details in order. Attempting to find the right answer is a good start as long as you don't try to do everything all at once."
aries,2011-01-11,"You are no stranger to overextending your energy, and you could fall into this familiar trap today unless you take the necessary precautions. Fortunately, avoiding problems now is easy if you're just willing to scale back on your promises and your plans before you're in over your head. However, it's much harder to find your way back to a manageable place if you wait until you're already exhausted."
taurus,2011-01-11,"You can talk a big game today, but playing it according to your plan won't be as straightforward as you think. It's easy to gloss over important details, but they will come back to haunt you before you're able to fulfill your promises. Recognizing that everything appears better than it actually is now may be enough to prevent an uncomfortable situation later in the day."
gemini,2011-01-11,"Your ruling planet, Mercury the Communicator, is still stirring up trouble for you, especially if you believe everything you hear. Of course, it's never wise to shoot the messenger, especially when he's bearing good news. However, don't reward him either, for that will only encourage the delivery of more exaggerated information. The truth is being stretched now, but you can save yourself from getting a headache by verifying all the facts."
cancer,2011-01-11,"It's not that the problems in your life have disappeared; it's just that they appear to be more manageable now. Your current willingness to take a risk certainly increases your options, but more alternatives don't necessarily mean that any of them will be the right one. Although you're able to defend your point of view successfully, it's smarter to act sooner than later to avoid potential conflict."
leo,2011-01-11,"If you are eager to involve others in your drama today, make certain that you are motivated by good intentions, rather than just wanting to garner attention. Your little crisis really does need to be solved, and, thankfully, someone may ask questions that can actually focus your thoughts. Your visions won't steer you wrong now, but you'll still need to bring them down to earth."
virgo,2011-01-11,"Your ruling planet Mercury squares big old Jupiter today, luring you down a slippery path of inflated confidence. Your current business savvy is admirable, but it can turn you into someone who can find justification for anything you do. Instead of wasting so much time trying to rationalize your choices, pay attention to the feedback you receive and adjust your course of action as necessary."
libra,2011-01-11,"You really don't like to argue with anyone, but you might just stand up and give someone a piece of your mind today. Be careful, for you're likely to get caught up in a whirlwind of intense energies that can spin you up to the jet streams and carry you far from home. Luckily, you should be about to talk your way in to or out of nearly anything now. Relying on your charm and cleverness works in your favor when you need it most."
scorpio,2011-01-11,"Overspending in order to impress someone you love won't be as appreciated as much as you wish. In fact, your feelings cannot be accurately expressed by buying anything material. Instead of putting yourself in a precarious position by going over budget on something that's unnecessary, try saying what you're feeling with as few words as possible. Your message will be more powerful if you speak from the heart."
sagittarius,2011-01-11,"You could feel like a bee that's drunk on pollen in a field of blooming wildflowers. Every good idea you have leads to another one and the supply seems endless as clever Mercury squares bountiful Jupiter. But everyone else may not agree with your positive assessments; they might even think that your optimism is blind. Remember, everything isn't as wonderful as it seems today, so wait a day or two before making any final decisions."
capricorn,2011-01-11,"You're still in an overconfident phase, but you should get a chance today to put your perspective back in balance. You can maintain a spiritual point of view based on the idea that everything is just as it should be. But don't use this line of reasoning as a justification for inaction. Ultimately, working toward your goals will make you feel better, even if you don't see any progress yet."
aquarius,2011-01-11,"You could lose focus today because it's naturally easier for you to imagine your future than to live in the present moment. Unfortunately, placing all your eggs in the basket of hope shifts your attention away from what you need to be doing now. Dreaming about the possibilities of what may be is often useful, but it can also get in the way of the hard work that's right in front of you."
pisces,2011-01-11,"It may feel as if you have one more chance to reach for the golden ring and your time is quickly running out. However, the sense of urgency that you're experiencing is based on a false assumption. Your current actions seem to wield more power than usual, but pushing too hard in the present moment can stir up more resistance than you need."
aries,2011-01-12,"Your ruling planet Mars comes to your assistance today as he aligns with brilliant Uranus, turning you into a hero at work. Your refusal to take no for an answer now leads you to find an original solution to a lingering problem. But you must stay fully aware of your goals or you could be tempted to set aside your responsibilities in favor of seeking fun. Don't give up; the satisfaction you'll receive by creating something lasting is much better than the possibility of momentary pleasure."
taurus,2011-01-12,"A subtle connection from passionate Pluto to your key planet Venus can remind you that your emotions don't always fit into the regular routine of your life. Your feelings aren't necessarily rational, especially if friends unexpectedly invite you to join them on a social outing. You might think that you don't have the time for such frivolity, but it may be a good idea to go ahead and do it anyway. You don't need to run away from your obligations; they will still be waiting for you when you return."
gemini,2011-01-12,"You may be able to talk yourself into following the group's plan, but you'll still probably change your mind during the day and do something on your own. Although you could try to blame your shift on the current situation, it's better to take responsibility for your decision. Acknowledge that you are feeling stifled and need immediate action. Luckily, there's no reason to hold yourself back because your impulsive tendencies will likely be rewarded today."
cancer,2011-01-12,"You may be provoked to take action at work today by someone who is goading you into stepping beyond your normal limits. Even if an outrageous plan sounds enticing, the very idea of doing anything so unconventional makes you anxious. Thankfully, you should receive support from the most unlikely people. Go ahead and try something new now; you'll be glad you did."
leo,2011-01-12,"You are on the verge of doing something you might regret, so take your time and consider your actions carefully before following an impulsive whim. Luckily, there are many shades of gray, so you don't have to make an all-or-nothing choice. Exercising a bit of caution still allows you to have your fair share of fun."
virgo,2011-01-12,"You appear to be more serious than you actually are today. You are doing a pretty good job of hiding your excitement, even if you're more restless than anyone realizes. Be careful; if someone close to you is ready for action, you might just cut loose and join in. As long as you are aware of your obligations, you should be able to slip away for some fun and get back before anyone notices that you're gone."
libra,2011-01-12,"You could work yourself up into an anxious state as you compare your ideal fantasies with the actual day ahead. You really don't want to repeat the same old routines in the exact way you did them before. You're intrigued by doing things differently today, and anything that's unconventional is attractive to you now. However, just because you can dream it, doesn't mean that you should make it real."
scorpio,2011-01-12,"Although your day may be flowing smoothly, you still want more freedom today. Thankfully, your workday might allow you more opportunity than usual to try something new. If you take a risk and let others know what you need, you might be pleasantly surprised with the outcome. Don't close yourself off to unrealized possibilities before you even explore your options."
sagittarius,2011-01-12,"Today may bring fun and games, but the excitement level could be a bit too much. Your feelings are inconsistent now, and whatever you do, it might seem as if you should be doing something else. Nevertheless, the lack of stability increases your attraction to the thrill of the uncertainty. Enjoy the buzz while it lasts, for things will begin to settle back down in a couple of days."
capricorn,2011-01-12,"You might not be comfortable with the current emotional turmoil and, unfortunately, nothing you do seems to calm the turbulence. You are better off now to let go and ride the rough waves instead of trying to control your direction. Thankfully, the anxiety begins to dissipate once you concentrate on maintaining balance, rather than trying to manage all the variables in your environment at once."
aquarius,2011-01-12,"It's not as simple as it should be today, because you don't want to share your feelings with everyone. Fortunately, you know what you want and where you are going, but don't want to involve others in the process yet. Your impatience could tempt you to jump the gun and impulsively do something foolish, so move carefully and think twice before making any decisions. Rest assured you have a lot more time than you realize."
pisces,2011-01-12,"You are eager to try something that is outside your usual comfort zone today, and this can take others by surprise. Unfortunately, they may judge you unkindly for your erratic behavior and might accuse you of being immature and irresponsible. However, this is your moment of truth, regardless of anyone else's expectations. Act with confidence and express who you are and what you want."
aries,2011-01-13,"Normally, too much restraint would make you feel restless, but today it probably won't cause you much concern. In fact, you may be eager to meet all your obligations because that would separate you from the pack and show others what you can do. Additionally, once you finish your chores, you'll be able to justify doing something that's more pleasurable and no one will be able to find fault with your plans."
taurus,2011-01-13,"It's challenging to settle down today, even though the Moon is back in your sign. You may be on edge because you're processing more information than you prefer. You might start feeling better if you plan a quick vacation getaway in the next few weeks. Stepping back from the intense demands that are being placed on you will help you regain your stability. Even if you cannot take a few days off, at least give yourself time to integrate what you've learned with your sense of reality."
gemini,2011-01-13,"You might resist your responsibilities today as your key planet Mercury enters conservative Capricorn. You know that you should stick to the script now, but it's not so easy to turn off your thinking. Current opportunities appear real enough that you are tempted to explore them even if it's not the best use of your time. There's nothing wrong with broadening your horizons, but you'll be better off if you finish what you've already started before distracting yourself with something new."
cancer,2011-01-13,"This can be a relatively easygoing day, but you may become annoyed by someone who wants to control what you're doing when you're planning your future. It's not that you mind setting boundaries to establish your independence; it's just that you have more important things to do and don't want to waste your energy. Nevertheless, taking life one step at a time now makes more sense than looking too far ahead."
leo,2011-01-13,"Today feels like a day overflowing with opportunities, yet you may find it difficult to keep your opinions to yourself. Even if you're leaning toward a positive assessment of the potential, it's hard to make something tangible happen. Be careful, for you can become overbearing if you don't monitor your own feelings. You cannot manifest every great idea, so practice letting your dreams and fantasies freely float away. The most important visions will return with even more vivid detail."
virgo,2011-01-13,"You believe that your logic is sound today, but you still could be overly optimistic as the super strong will of Mars combines with confident Jupiter to lead you astray. Fortunately, you intuitively know that whatever you begin now can be brought to fruition as long as you maintain a realistic attitude. There is a lot to do and there isn't a better time than this moment to get started."
libra,2011-01-13,"You may be feeling stressed out today because the peace you want seems so elusive. Unfortunately, your dreaming cannot make the external drama disappear. One intelligent strategy is to closely watch your interactions with close friends and family, because your tendency now is to narrow your thinking. Choose your own destination and then slowly work your way in that direction."
scorpio,2011-01-13,"The pressure to do something creative continues to build and you are motivated to take a risk to make something big happen. But instead of trying to shift gears and change into a production artist overnight, it may be to smarter now to fulfill your obligations and stick with your current course of action. You can always find ways to express your originality without turning your life upside down."
sagittarius,2011-01-13,"Your ruling planet, Jupiter, focuses its optimistic lens on whatever is most exciting in your life today. It may be difficult to squelch your eager anticipation, yet, thankfully, it shouldn't turn into a problem. Your enthusiasm is contagious and can motivate others to live up to their potential as well. Now's the time to get involved with those who can help you save the world one person at a time."
capricorn,2011-01-13,"You may be seeking a leadership position, but you don't want to take on additional responsibilities at this time. Even if you have been restless, trickster Mercury enters your sign today, forcing you to stay grounded. No one wants to hear you talk about your professional aspirations today. Instead, they want to know what's in your heart. Luckily, you are able to make a decision, but rest assured it doesn't have to be written in stone. You can change your mind later if you must."
aquarius,2011-01-13,"You are unable to suppress your enthusiasm now, yet you're not quite ready to swing into action. There's a lot at stake today and you may be overwhelmed by it all. Fortunately, you should be able to deliver on your commitments, so don't talk yourself out of participating. Ultimately, you will feel good about your contribution if you don't hold anything back."
pisces,2011-01-13,"You are standing right at the edge of a profound breakthrough, making it vital for you to maintain a positive attitude. However, being confident doesn't mean that you're fearless; it simply means that you are willing to face your fears. Ultimately, the forces of optimism and good luck can overcome most obstacles today, so continue pushing forward while it still matters."
aries,2011-01-14,"If you are waiting for the best time to start a new project, don't miss your chance to take advantage of the stabilizing effects of today's Taurus Moon. Although this isn't about zipping along toward your goals, it's great for making methodical progress on your long-term plan. Don't even think about trying to reach the finish line right now. Simply look out toward the distant horizon, aim your intentions carefully and inch closer to your destination with determination."
taurus,2011-01-14,"The Moon's visit to your sign can help you to reestablish your center of gravity, especially if you are feeling lost. There isn't anything wrong with a vivid imagination, but your fantasies may fade just enough to enable you to see the difference between fact and fancy. Although a more pragmatic approach can be comforting, don't run away from your dreams."
gemini,2011-01-14,"You can see opportunities at work through a very practical lens, but may not be able to make much progress if you stay stuck in the past. You might be reluctant to share your fears with others because you believe that self-doubt grows if you give it voice. There's no need to push too hard right now; you'll do best if you slow your pace so you can put your ingenuity to work."
cancer,2011-01-14,"You may be a bit lighter on your feet today as an ongoing conflict between two sides of your nature begins to subside. However, being released from one set of worries can quickly make room for new concerns as you question if you'll be able to carry out your plan. Don't waste mind power judging yourself harshly before you even start. Your journey may take a long while, so don't give up if you're not seeing the progress you expect."
leo,2011-01-14,"Today's Moon in your 10th House of Career has you wondering what business opportunities may come your way this year. However, it's not the best time to think too far into the future or you'll surely miss something critical in the present moment. Making plans is a constructive activity, but you should also pay attention to current circumstances. If you're looking too far ahead now, you could miss a teacher or helper who is standing right next to you."
virgo,2011-01-14,"Blind optimism has been a significant part of your personal story these days, and you are quite hopeful that things will get better. Fortunately, you can see a path that will lead you to your preferred destination as the Moon moves through sensible Taurus. Pay careful attention to your actions; the less energy you waste today, the better your chances of reaching your goal."
libra,2011-01-14,"You are determined to uncover the source of someone's mistrust, but something's shifting in your energy field and your schedule. You are ready to show your creative side and are eager to be seen in a positive light. Luckily, it's easier to find the happiness you seek without much extra effort on your part. Trust your instincts and be ready to gratefully accept the admiration heading your way."
scorpio,2011-01-14,"You may have a unique approach in dealing with someone who has a very different perspective than you. Initiating a serious dialogue today could change the way you view the situation. What others think about you is less important than how you feel about yourself. Don't avoid an intense interaction, for it can teach you a critical lesson about self-acceptance."
sagittarius,2011-01-14,"Your life is about to get busier, and although you might try to resist, this should be a positive change. It's not just about introducing more activities into your life; you are also anticipating all that you can learn with so much going on. The overall intensity continues to accelerate and could last for months, so conserve your energy. Too much frivolity can lead to burnout. A steady work pace enables you to accomplish more and relax with greater ease."
capricorn,2011-01-14,"You have a strong sense of confidence now, even though you may feel somewhat let down if you haven't reached your financial goals. Your stress level could jump if you believe that you're running out of time. You are driven to push hard today for fear that your energy level won't be sufficient later on. Luckily, you may be able to increase your income this year, but remember that everything takes time."
aquarius,2011-01-14,"You have become quite accomplished at keeping your desires to yourself. And although others may not realize what your real intentions are, they're about to find out as Mars leaves your 12th House of Secrets tomorrow and pushes into your 1st House of Personality. In the meantime, start visualizing your new direction. You won't reach satisfaction immediately, but you should notice an energetic shift within a few days."
pisces,2011-01-14,"You can call it whatever you wish, but you have grown spiritually in ways that will continue enriching your life for years to come. Today, however, your more sensible side encourages you to question the value of any impractical endeavors. Don't panic; the answers to your questions will appear just in time for you to start your next important journey."
aries,2011-01-15,"You've been hitting the brakes recently while your ruling planet Mars traveled through cautious Capricorn. Today, however, the warrior planet shifts into independent Aquarius to support your natural instinct to lead by example. Unfortunately, reckless behavior in the days ahead is very tempting. Keep in mind that it's much smarter to hold onto some energy for later on when you're going to need it most."
taurus,2011-01-15,Pushing forward at work grows more important now that assertive Mars is in your 10th House of Career. You may become so motivated with the idea of success that other areas of your life suffer. Don't allow your finances to go unattended for too long or your denial might create problems for you. Handling a tricky situation before it grows out of control is much easier than untangling a mess after the fact.
gemini,2011-01-15,"You may be the original ""Comeback Kid"" because of your natural resilience. Now, it's even easier for you to imagine how everything will work out. Paradoxically, the Moon is back in your sign today, encouraging you to bring your emotions closer to the surface. But it's very likely that others will pick up on your moodiness. Don't worry about what everyone else thinks; just focus on your goals. Success is within reach if you don't let yourself get distracted."
cancer,2011-01-15,"You have been rather serious about your relationships lately, and today's entry of Mars into your 8th House of Sharing can remind you to re-establish clear boundaries. Being self-contained now is critical to your continuing growth. Fortunately, you aren't likely to lose your unique perspective because your analytical powers are strong. Rational thinking is fine, but don't use it as a way of avoiding your true feelings."
leo,2011-01-15,"Although you may not be very sensitive to other people's needs today, you can still pick up on the truth, especially if someone is more aggressive than usual. Your friends and family might be more assertive around you, and resisting this energy will only serve to feed it. Instead of reigniting a conflict, aim your intentions at a positive goal and keep moving in that direction, no matter what anyone else says."
virgo,2011-01-15,"This is a day of paradoxes as you attempt to focus on what's most important. Unfortunately, there is so much happening now that you might be pulled off course. You are tempted to take on more than you can do in the amount of time you have available. You cannot be everything to everybody. Start less, but do whatever you undertake well."
libra,2011-01-15,"You may be feeling more upbeat today, and running into an unexpected problem won't likely bring you down. Your special brand of creativity receives a boost when Mars moves into your 5th House of Spontaneity. The time for analysis has passed; instead of weighing and balancing every single decision, let your immediate reaction be your guide."
scorpio,2011-01-15,"You are filled with contradictions today. You have an uncharacteristic sense of detachment now and yet your feelings are extremely deep, blessing you with a sharp perspective on what's happening. But you aren't interested in sharing your internal process because you're not seeking anyone else's point of view. Still, a heartfelt discussion with a friend is a good idea, even if it's simply for the comfort that it offers."
sagittarius,2011-01-15,"Fasten your seatbelt because your life is getting crazier by the minute. Even if you decide to cut back on your activities, it still may be nearly impossible to cancel your appointments. Whatever you don't do today will simply be added to tomorrow's calendar. Although you cannot avoid responsibilities, you can make smart use of your time by relaxing at home so you don't burn yourself out too soon."
capricorn,2011-01-15,"You may be attracted to starting a new project, yet it's more sensible now to build on something that already exists. Enterprising Mars is visiting your 2nd House of Finances, encouraging you to invest your time and money, rather than going out and indulging in something you don't actually need. Nevertheless, you might feel like rebelling against your own boredom today, so be careful about purchasing something impulsively and then regretting it later."
aquarius,2011-01-15,"Feisty Mars blasts into your sign for a six-week stay, and your blood runs hotter while the warrior planet is in your 1st House of Self. However, it's still wise to seek ways to constructively express your excess energy, rather than watching it grow into anger or resentment. The good news is that you have extra stamina now, so this is a great time to start a project that requires hard work. Keep in mind that you'll feel better once you have something physical to do."
pisces,2011-01-15,"The complexity of your current situation may require you to act extroverted, even if you would rather withdraw from social interactions. The fantasy of solitude could be quite appealing now, yet circumstances probably won't allow you to be introverted and avoid your social commitments. Thankfully, you can still travel within your dreams as long as you stay present to show up in the outer world when necessary."
aries,2011-01-16,"You may feel more positive about your future today, even if you are still aware of your problems. Your growing confidence is supported by co-workers and friends who are enthusiastic about your ideas. Although something still isn't quite right, don't make any changes to your plans; holding your current course will pay off in the long run."
taurus,2011-01-16,"You've been concentrating your efforts on what's most significant lately, but it's getting harder to pay attention. Something or someone may come along now, distracting you into wasting energy before you even realize what happened. Although you might not be able to stop your mind from wandering, conscious intervention can pull you back to reality before you falter."
gemini,2011-01-16,"You have been anticipating a change in your overall life path and now the time has come to make it happen. This might seem like a minor adjustment, yet it can turn out to be an important one. But don't make choices based on your whim of the moment; consider your options carefully and then go with the one that will carry you the farthest."
cancer,2011-01-16,"Friends and co-workers may be very annoying today, especially if they appear unrealistically determined to have their way. You can't understand how anyone can be so blind while standing face to face with contradictory facts. Don't try to show others the errors of their ways now; everyone needs to learn their lessons on their own. Meanwhile, you have your own stuff to worry about."
leo,2011-01-16,"It's easy to connect with your friends in a social situation today, enabling you to be more playful. However, you might try to overdo the partying. Instead of unconsciously scattering your physical energy on passing pleasures, watch where your interactions with others take you. Make intelligent decisions based only on how you want your day to unfold."
virgo,2011-01-16,"Your thoughts linger on choices you must make at work next week, but you can clearly see two opposing solutions to your current problem. It's tough to pick one path over another, for they both have distinct advantages and disadvantages. However, you have to make a decision now, so jot down the pros and cons of each option and then make your choice. Fortunately, there are no wrong answers as long as you take the time to go through your analytical process."
libra,2011-01-16,"You have a number of good ideas today, but it may be difficult to focus on just one. You want to explore a wide variety of options to determine your future but don't want to be limited by any one choice. Fortunately, there's no reason for you to narrow your thinking at this time. Just enjoy playing with all the possibilities and leave the big questions for another day."
scorpio,2011-01-16,"You are often ready to dig into the center of circumstances to discover the hidden truth. But now you might try avoiding any emotional intensity by dancing around the edges of an extremely significant issue. Even if you feel isolated, there is no urgent need to solve every single mystery today. Give yourself permission to flow along with the energy and see where it takes you."
sagittarius,2011-01-16,"Everyone seems to be moving too fast for your liking today. You might try to slow others down by engaging them in philosophical conversations, but your workmates are just as unfocused as you are now. It may be easier to withdraw, instead of attempting to control what's happening around you. There's nothing wrong with taking some time to be alone for a while."
capricorn,2011-01-16,"You may become increasingly anxious today as you are pulled in a multitude of directions. Prioritizing your responsibilities will help because you need to acknowledge that you can't do everything that is being asked of you now. Leaving a job undone for a while longer may be very frustrating, but it's the best way to manage the current complexity."
aquarius,2011-01-16,"You are energized today as things begin to improve all around you. You are able to enjoy yourself while meeting your obligations, but you are certainly busier than usual. You could bite off more than you can chew, so it's a smart idea to practice self-control. If you don't go running around all over the place, you will accomplish more than you expect."
pisces,2011-01-16,"The Moon's current visit to your 4th House of Home and Family highlights your need to retreat from the fast pace of modern life. But you may be surprised, or even shocked, by how busy you are, even when you're securely situated inside of your castle. Practice enjoying the distractions instead of trying to shut them out. There will be more time to relax next week."
aries,2011-01-17,"You may be surprised if you discover that you've been running around so fast lately that you forgot to do something that was very important. Hopefully, you'll have this realization early enough in the day to remedy the situation. However, instead of overextending yourself today, you can make a conscious decision to set priorities before you run into trouble."
taurus,2011-01-17,"You might believe that your cautious approach to making plans will be enough to prevent any problems from surfacing, but it's nearly impossible to think of everything in advance. Don't worry if something pops up unexpectedly today. Instead of reacting fearfully, consider what this new information can teach you and respond as openly as possible. Integrating a different perspective now places you in an even stronger position than where you were before."
gemini,2011-01-17,"Your moods are changing so quickly this morning that it's difficult for you to explain what you're feeling. By the time you begin talking about your emotions, they have already begun to shift. You may become anxious and try to say too much too fast because you want to catch the wave, but this strategy will only add to your frustration. Paradoxically, saying less will help you gain clarity so you can speak with more authority later on in the day."
cancer,2011-01-17,"It's not easy for you to be patient today because you're expecting something good to happen. The Moon's midday return to your sign empowers you, but you're still not likely to tell anyone what you need. You see no reason now to waste energy with words when a more direct approach of initiating action can lead you to your goal. Even if it's not your regular style, don't miss the current opportunity to pursue happiness."
leo,2011-01-17,"Although you have been socially active during the past couple of days, you may feel the need to retreat today as the Moon enters your 12th House of Privacy. But even if you want to be alone, you still can benefit from collaborating with others. Completely shutting yourself off from everyone isn't your best move now; instead, finding common ground while also establishing clear boundaries is a smart alternative."
virgo,2011-01-17,"You can be extremely picky when choosing who to hang out with, but it's easy to let down your guard once someone has received your stamp of approval. Your openness can be disarming now, for you are able to shift gears quickly. Your friends and colleagues might be very surprised if they judge you only by your appearance, for your aloofness disappears quickly once you make the choice to warm up. Nevertheless, don't wait too long to show your interest or it could end up being too late."
libra,2011-01-17,"You might resent the responsibility that co-workers place on you today. You really don't want to be the one in charge, nor do you want anyone else to depend on you. But it's not so easy to avoid your obligations now, especially if you've led others to believe that you would be there for them if they needed you. Stop fighting against the pressure to perform your job and rise to the occasion, instead."
scorpio,2011-01-17,"You may be feeling jittery, yet increasing your physical activity doesn't seem to do anything to settle your nerves. Unfortunately, you won't be able to work off your excess energy. Instead, you may be better off by pursuing self-expression through creative endeavors now. Rather than trying to prove yourself by being productive, focus on something that brings you pleasure. You can always pick up your work tomorrow where you left off today."
sagittarius,2011-01-17,"You're tired of trying to keep up with others who are so wrapped up with their performances that they miss the point. You just aren't that interested now in people who don't share your goals. Instead of going out of your way to discuss things that don't matter to you, save your energy for a truly meaningful interaction. Remember, you'll be happier today with one significant connection over a multitude of trivial ones."
capricorn,2011-01-17,"You can feel the shift in your energy today as lighthearted interactions with co-workers begin to tire you out. You are growing bored with shallow conversations and begin to seek more depth from others. You're ready to break out of the safety of your current relationships and explore new ways of communicating. Thankfully, you don't need to have a detailed plan. Just expressing your intentions is enough to start the ball rolling."
aquarius,2011-01-17,"The calculating Capricorn Sun is rattled by your key planet Uranus the Awakener. Although you may not be looking for new information now, you could be confronted with an idea that contradicts your prior assumptions. Don't be so quick to reject today's news, even if it temporarily turns your life upside down. Once you realize the truth, you'll be glad that you had the courage to change your point of view."
pisces,2011-01-17,"Normally, it's wise to consider the source of incoming information, but today, being overly discerning isn't necessarily useful. It's not about whether something is truthful or not; it's more about your reaction to whatever comes your way. Nearly anything that stimulates your creativity is good; you can always sort out the facts later on. For now, take a risk and dare to express yourself in a new and exciting way."
aries,2011-01-18,"It may be a bit of a struggle to acknowledge your feelings because they could get in the way of your original plan. Fortunately, you have the strength now to handle some very intense self-examination that can bring your career objectives into greater focus. But the real lesson today isn't about professional success; it's about balancing your work with relationships that bring more meaning into your life."
taurus,2011-01-18,You could be so convinced that you're heading in the right direction now that you're surprised if something happens to make you reconsider your previous decision. This is not the best time to wield your infamous bull-headed stubbornness or you could short circuit the current process of discovery. Remain open to information that you recently dismissed as unimportant. Don't be afraid of the truth; it really can set you free.
gemini,2011-01-18,"Although others may believe that you are more interested in lighthearted banter and clever one-liners, you are determined to get to the bottom of a mystery today. You are completely focused on uncovering the hidden story because you think that what you learn now can have a positive impact on your relationships. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks; trusting your instincts will lead you to the truth."
cancer,2011-01-18,"You are often able to hide your feelings if you aren't comfortable expressing them in a particular situation, but you might not have the luxury of making such a choice today. Even if you say nothing, others will know that you're avoiding something important. An interaction with a close friend or partner can get very intense if he or she presses you on a subject you don't want to talk about. Resistance may be futile; additionally, you'll probably feel relief once you spill the beans."
leo,2011-01-18,"If you become fixated on a fantasy today, it's difficult to get it out of your mind. This obsessive thinking can be problematic if it distracts you from your responsibilities. But turning into a workaholic isn't any better, especially if you are trying to avoid a difficult personal issue. Even if you don't feel as if you're fully in control, moderating your extreme reactions will make your life more manageable."
virgo,2011-01-18,"You are known to be critical in your analysis of a situation, and today your mental acuity is turned toward creative endeavors. Your key planet Mercury joins incisive Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression, intensifying your relationships and sharpening the edge of your messages. Choose your words carefully, for everything you say will carry the extra weight of passion. Ultimately, it's more useful to put the energy of your emotions directly into your work."
libra,2011-01-18,You aren't comfortable letting others at work know how you feel today. Perhaps you believe that they won't be able to handle your honesty -- and maybe you are right. But you must examine the emotional price you will pay if you try to protect someone else from your observations. Overcome your fear of telling the truth by acknowledging that it's not your job to filter out difficult subjects for anyone else.
scorpio,2011-01-18,"You are at home with today's emotional intensity, but this doesn't mean that everyone else is. You may be the catalyst that starts a reaction, making others wary of your presence. But attempting to avoid your true feelings or watering them down to make them more palatable is an unacceptable strategy. You don't have to dwell on the dark side, but others are counting on you to tell it like it is."
sagittarius,2011-01-18,"Your normally outgoing nature mixes with today's brooding intensity like oil and water. You aren't willing to let go of your optimism; you have exciting plans and you're eager to head out on life's next great adventure. However, nothing is going to be as simple and straightforward as you expected. Instead of letting emotional negativity stand between you and happiness, let go of your previous expectations. Positive results cannot occur while you're stoically holding on to the past."
capricorn,2011-01-18,"You aren't humored by someone's emotional disclosure today; in fact, you are tempted to walk away from an uncomfortable conversation before it really begins. However, when pushed into a corner, you'll be able to find your inner resolve and stand up to anyone who is blocking your progress. There's no holding you back now as long as you're willing to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth."
aquarius,2011-01-18,"You are able to quietly go about your business today, without attracting a lot of attention. It's almost as if the radar system that's been tracking your progress has stopped functioning. But don't think you can use the day to play hooky; your invisibility cloak only works when you are attending to your responsibilities. Just do what's expected of you now with the understanding that your rewards will have to wait."
pisces,2011-01-18,"You are usually quite comfortable negotiating your way through confusing territory, but current circumstances may push you to your limit. You aren't interested in frivolity and fantasy today; instead you want your friends and co-workers to be brutally honest with you. Unfortunately, the full truth may not be forthcoming. Instead of filling in the gaps with your fertile imagination, work only with the actual information in front of you. Sticking to the facts is your wisest strategy for now."
aries,2011-01-19,"Today's soulful Full Moon pulls on your heartstrings from a very profound place, raising long forgotten memories from your childhood. But, you fiery Rams aren't normally that interested in looking backward. You want to pioneer a path through the tangled emotional jungle so you can reach your destination. Don't move too quickly; you still might have a bit of work to do before you're allowed to move forward."
taurus,2011-01-19,"If possible, take some time away from work today. Even if you are very busy, you can still disappear for a short while by hiding within the privacy of your home or going on a personal mini-retreat without telling anyone. Keep in mind that how long you are gone is not all that important; the quality of your downtime is what counts. Shut out the rest of the world and concentrate on yourself."
gemini,2011-01-19,"The hard-shelled Cancer Full Moon lights up your 2nd House of Net Worth, encouraging you to be possessive now of what you own. However, you also need to consider others when making decisions about your property, especially if you are in a partnership. Don't try to force resolution on any money-related issues today; instead, let the discussions follow their own course, even if it takes longer to find common ground."
cancer,2011-01-19,"You may be unprepared for the strength of your feelings today as the Full Moon activates your sensitive sign. Emotions tug at every thought from their subterranean vantage points, making it difficult to maintain objectivity. Don't ignore your personal needs; the wisest thing you can do now is to practice balancing the demands of others with your own desires."
leo,2011-01-19,"You want to continue with your regular routines, including eating whatever makes the most sense to you. But unconscious desires can lure you away from your healthier resolutions. Don't judge yourself so harshly if you slip off track today. Meanwhile, keep working toward your goals and you'll notice progress soon enough."
virgo,2011-01-19,"Today's nurturing Cancer Full Moon brings helpful emotional support from your friends and family. Unfortunately, you are not being offered a free lunch by everyone, since someone may be resisting the very same changes you are trying to make. Although problems can originate with anyone who is threatened by your potential success, seek ways to work with the negativity rather than denying it."
libra,2011-01-19,"You are called upon to take care of others now that the protective Cancer Full Moon brightens your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Your motives could be questioned or you may personally be challenged if you don't deliver what's expected of you today. Luckily, you might be able to pull off an amazing turnaround at the very last minute if you truly believe you can. Have faith in yourself and the rest will follow."
scorpio,2011-01-19,"You are able to intuitively pick the best solution to a complex problem today. Although you might tell others that your idea isn't a big deal, the truth is that you are the one that can uncover the brilliant answer, like finding a needle that was lost in the haystack. As long as you hold on to a clear vision of the future, you'll have a real shot at getting what you want."
sagittarius,2011-01-19,"Today's caring Cancer Full Moon is a real challenge for you because it activates your 8th House of Shared Resources. Unfortunately, you may feel as if you don't have complete control over your own priorities now. However, your possible loss of power can teach you an important lesson about your limitations. Once you accept your current situation, the previously resistant walls can give way and reveal your path ahead."
capricorn,2011-01-19,"Today's cautious Cancer Full Moon reflects your 7th House of Partners, revealing a stressful undercurrent in a significant relationship. Perhaps your spouse feels guilty about a recent activity. Or maybe there's an urgent conversation that needs to occur. Your smartest tactic now is to lessen your anxiety so you can focus on what works instead of what doesn't. Communication needs to run both ways, so start talking."
aquarius,2011-01-19,"Stop pushing your project or idea forward today; instead, retreat enough so you can build defenses to hold your ground. Thankfully, you could receive an extra boost of confidence later in the afternoon or evening. Still, it's important that you don't take on too much work or the tentative Cancer Full Moon will convince you to stop wasting your energy. For now, do only what is absolutely necessary and take some time to unwind."
pisces,2011-01-19,"The tender Cancer Full Moon falls in your 5th House of Romance and Creativity, encouraging you to have fun while expressing yourself. Still, your friends could act quite judgmental, distorting your easygoing attitude and misinterpreting your true intentions. Don't skip over any miscommunications today; take a few minutes and clear things up before moving on to what's next."
aries,2011-01-20,"You continue to move toward a powerful turning point in your life, yet now it feels even closer than ever before. However, you're not necessarily at ease because your habitual patterns have already started to change. The problem is that your new vision hasn't yet taken form. Although you may be annoyed that the process is taking so long, resign yourself to progressing at whatever speed the currents carry you along."
taurus,2011-01-20,"You may not be motivated to work very hard today, even if others are depending on you. You could be so bored with business as usual that you might try to shake things up a bit. Actually, it's wiser to allow yourself to feel the tension without initiating action now. Don't worry; the change that is in the air is inevitable. Ultimately, your patience will be rewarded."
gemini,2011-01-20,"Even your most intelligent plan could suddenly fall apart today, but it's not smart to waste energy worrying about what might have been. Instead, you would be better off to concentrate on what is possible. You have too much at stake to hold on to a strategy that isn't working. Your flexibility is your greatest strength now, so figure out the best way to reach your goals by responding to the changing currents."
cancer,2011-01-20,"You could reach new creative heights today, but you must consciously channel your feelings in a positive direction or they could mire you down in a swamp of complications. If you attempt to hold on to an old habit or attitude, you may become entangled in the mess. Fortunately, anything is possible if you are willing to let go of the past."
leo,2011-01-20,"It's difficult to admit when your plan isn't working, yet your pride can stand between you and success now. Someone has entered your life and is eager to guide you along on your path. But it's impossible for anyone to make a meaningful connection with you if you appear too self-sufficient. You may feel uncomfortable sharing your vulnerabilities, but it could be the smartest thing you can do today."
virgo,2011-01-20,What's the use of putting your best foot forward if there's something inherently wrong with your overall strategy? It's more important today to reconsider your approach to work than try to fine-tune the details of your presentation. Don't change too much yet; just observe what's happening now without making a final judgment. Decide what you want to do about your current state of affairs after your attitude improves.
libra,2011-01-20,"You may be concerned that your creativity is slipping away today, but rest assured that won't happen. Instead of working on an exciting project, you might have to complete an unfinished task left over from last month. Don't attempt to take on too much work all at once. Save your strength; you could experience the breakthrough you want later in the week."
scorpio,2011-01-20,"It isn't easy for you to let go of negative feelings, but it certainly can be a clean break from your past once you finally take action. The Sun enters progressive Aquarius today, giving you a unique opportunity to see what's been holding you back. Don't be afraid; this is your chance to take a quantum leap into your future, even if it still takes more time for the shift to ripple through your soul."
sagittarius,2011-01-20,"Everything is looking great from the outside, but you know what they say about judging a book by its cover. Nevertheless, others might not bother to look beyond your surface appearance today. Unfortunately, this can be quite upsetting now as you question the relative significance of your current relationships. Don't change course; keep being yourself and those who matter will ultimately see the true you."
capricorn,2011-01-20,"The radiant Sun slips out of your hardworking sign today to enter futuristic Aquarius. This cosmic shift encourages you to broaden your horizons and to widen your field of vision. But it isn't easy to relinquish control, especially if you don't like which way the wind is blowing. There is no need to struggle so hard, even if you are unable to catch the breeze. Let yourself be blown off course now; you can make the necessary adjustments later on."
aquarius,2011-01-20,"It seems as if you've been dancing on the edge between the old and the new for some time now. Today, the Sun's shift into intelligent Aquarius thrusts you into the future, but don't get too giddy at the thought of breaking free just yet. You may find yourself anchored to the status quo, even if you don't realize it. Wait a few days and then reassess your position before making a mad dash for the finish line."
pisces,2011-01-20,"You may be quite work-oriented as you head out into the real world today. However, your overactive imagination is feeding you with an endless stream of fantasies -- some desirable and some not. Don't try to control your thoughts; just let them flow as if they were the soundtrack to a picture show, without forming an attachment to any one idea. Once the intensity settles down, then you'll be able to decide which dreams are the most sensible to follow."
aries,2011-01-21,"Even if you think that you can power your way through the day, you may need to slow down and get one task done right before pushing on to the next one. Finishing a job doesn't always mean that you've done it correctly. Take time to consider the logistics of what you are doing or you could be frustrated later when you discover that you must go back and redo something that you believed was already completed."
taurus,2011-01-21,"Establishing a steady pace improves your chances of reaching your destination today, but you might feel that someone wants you to work faster. Instead of sacrificing quality for increased production, you must find the courage to set reasonable boundaries. Don't be afraid to let everyone know exactly what you can and cannot do. Then, follow up by doing the best job you can. Fortunately, others will eventually recognize your positive contribution when you show the results of your work."
gemini,2011-01-21,"Maintaining your focus can be quite challenging today, for your mind wanders around rather than concentrating on the task at hand. Still, you are aware of the pressure that others are placing on you now and you want to make every effort to do your part. However, a minor distraction is enough to lead you on a major detour. Don't waste energy being hard on yourself if you get off track and waste too much time. Just remember to bring your attention back to what you were doing before moving on to what's next."
cancer,2011-01-21,"It makes you anxious if others try to make you work harder today. It isn't that you're unable to meet their demands; you would just rather be in charge of your own schedule. Be careful; you might have to suppress your rebellious attitude for a while as you do the best you can to fulfill your obligations. Thankfully, your extra effort won't go unnoticed."
leo,2011-01-21,"It's been challenging to keep your emotions in check while the Moon has been traveling through your dramatic sign. Although you're quite skilled at presenting yourself in the best possible light, you may be unsuccessful in pretending that everything is fine today. Don't hide your warm heart under cold efficiency. You can still finish your work while also being honest about your feelings."
virgo,2011-01-21,"Your perceptions are even more accurate now than usual, but this doesn't mean you should act on every conclusion you reach. Your analysis may not be as balanced today as you think. Caution is advised because you tend to focus on the imperfections in others and yourself. An intelligent strategy now is to remain an observer. Wait a few days before finalizing any plans because things will soon look much better."
libra,2011-01-21,"Sharing your ideas with others seems like a good idea at first, but soon it becomes apparent that interpersonal politics are more complicated than you thought. Maybe it would be easier if you praised your colleagues and told them how great they are instead of speaking your mind. But your willingness to please others can run you through stressful scenarios again and again. Relax the pressure by temporarily detaching yourself from the situation. Take no action until tomorrow after you've had time to rest."
scorpio,2011-01-21,"You might be forced to relinquish control as the day unfolds and your personal agenda begins to transform. Give yourself some breathing room; allow enough flexibility to cancel a previous commitment if your goals have shifted. Don't be overly concerned about anyone else's disappointment. Just do what feels right, even if you have to gently let someone down in the process. Take care of your own needs first; this strengthens your relationships with others in the long run."
sagittarius,2011-01-21,"You may be required to take a position on a significant issue today, but it's not a good idea to make up your mind until you have done enough research to be fully informed. Sharing your opinions before you have gathered all the facts only makes you look unprofessional or even foolish. Take the time to completely flush out the truth. Demonstrating your integrity helps you improve your standing with everyone at work."
capricorn,2011-01-21,"Trusting your intuition is tougher than usual, because the facts can be so entangled with fantasy that it's tricky knowing what's true. You can get lost in the data as you step through your rigorous analysis, but you still might not arrive at the best conclusion. Study the information and then set it aside for a while. A moment of inspiration will ultimately bring you the right answer."
aquarius,2011-01-21,"You don't know if you've gone deep enough yet, for the more you dig, the more you learn. Nevertheless, at some point, you must finish your research and actually put what you've learned to practical use. Once you acknowledge that you've uncovered a bottomless pit, you'll be able to stop spinning your intellectual and professional wheels. The time for thinking is over; get to work and apply your wealth of knowledge to getting ahead."
pisces,2011-01-21,"You may be struggling with your work today. The problem is that others might be very harsh with their judgments about what you are doing now. Instead of working to accommodate others, try meeting your own expectations. Your attitude counts for a lot; if you feel positive about your current effort, that's all that really matters."
aries,2011-01-22,"You are eager to do an excellent job today and your willingness to put in the extra effort makes others appreciate you even more. You're motivated on your own, but it doesn't hurt that you're being noticed. Don't let your confidence go to your head now; optimistic Jupiter's shift into your sign is a harbinger of good times ahead as long as you don't expect more than you deserve."
taurus,2011-01-22,"Someone may be working behind the scenes to force you to switch your current direction. However, you are inclined to push back if you feel coerced. Your stubbornness could get in the way of learning what you need to know, especially if you try to shut others up before they are able to deliver an important message. Remain open to the truth, even if it isn't exactly what you want to hear now."
gemini,2011-01-22,"You might believe that you're a black belt in mental gymnastics, but every clever idea you toss into a conversation is shunted aside today. You may begin to feel ineffectual because your thoughts don't seem to be able to gain traction. It isn't fun if you can't combine several trains of thought into a single coherent knockout punch. Don't let frustration define your day; instead, recognize that you're currently just a bit off in your delivery. Thankfully, this won't last; your wit and charm will return soon enough."
cancer,2011-01-22,"It's a smart idea to say what you mean and mean what you say, or a miscommunication can turn an innocuous comment into a major conflict. Open disagreement isn't useful today, for you are already aware of the differences of opinion. There may not be an immediate resolution now because arguments won't likely be about the right issue. Think about the consequences of your words before you say anything at all."
leo,2011-01-22,"You may be facing a cash shortage today, yet your apparent lack of funds could be tied to a larger issue of self-esteem. If you don't believe that you're deserving of something special now, you are probably being much harder on yourself than you should. Be aware of any lingering negativity and put off a purchase decision until tomorrow when your approach will be more balanced."
virgo,2011-01-22,"You are moody now that the Moon is back in your sign. It's as if you're riding on a seesaw today; one minute you're quite confident and the next you're feeling uncertain. Instead of acknowledging the upside of things, you might get swept in a downward spiral of self-judgment. Fortunately, you have the power to change your direction and to lift yourself back up to the top of your game. Make an empowering decision and stick to it, no matter what happens along the way."
libra,2011-01-22,"You may be suffering from a creative block today, as if someone pulled the plug on your imagination circuit and you cannot make it work. Unfortunately, you might not be able to latch on to a dream to lift yourself out of the malaise. Fortunately, someone special may come along and inspire you, catalyzing positive change. Your negativity could dissipate quickly if you are open enough to accept help when it's offered."
scorpio,2011-01-22,"You might not want to participate in a group event with friends or family today, even if you love the individuals who are involved. Maybe it's just too complicated balancing everyone's different approaches to the day. You don't want to spend your time discussing the ground rules for some kind of social activity. Give yourself permission to retreat without having to justify your actions to everyone else."
sagittarius,2011-01-22,"You may try to place limits on yourself today so you can set a good example for others. But keeping everyone else in line is difficult when you're feeling antsy yourself. Expansive Jupiter's entry into your 5th House of Play can open your eyes to new avenues of fun. Fortunately, you should be able to balance your current responsibilities with the incoming waves of restlessness if you keep track of your priorities."
capricorn,2011-01-22,"You may be fantasizing about a great escape to somewhere exotic now that the Moon is visiting your 9th House of Travel. But it's hard to stay focused on planning a dream vacation, especially if it seems like an unrealistic flight of fancy. You could choose to give up and think about a homebound staycation instead. There's no need to rush; give yourself a few more days before making a final decision."
aquarius,2011-01-22,"You may have offered your opinion too quickly about something that's very important, and now you're unable to take back your words. A disagreement with your partner today can turn a sweet relationship into a combative one. Good intentions aren't enough; you also must be very realistic or everything can quickly grow out of control. Take full responsibility for your role in the current situation to get things moving in the right direction once again."
pisces,2011-01-22,"The Moon in your 7th House of Partners can help to stabilize a relationship today, as long as you're willing to narrow your focus. Although you may be thinking about how to improve your financial situation, it's more important now to concentrate on creating common ground with someone else, rather than going off on your own. Things won't change as quickly as you wish, so reduce the pressure by being less aggressive in your approach and allowing some time to pass before taking further action."
aries,2011-01-23,"You may have some very practical ideas today, along with a manageable action plan. But once you start moving, you might discover that you need an entirely new strategy to manifest your dreams. Unfortunately, you have a difficult time admitting that you're wrong until you realize how much energy you're wasting as you try to keep a fantasy alive. Flexibility is your secret weapon now."
taurus,2011-01-23,"Knowing exactly where you stand is quite important to you, because you like to have steady ground beneath your feet prior to building on it. Now, however, this need for certainty can turn into a problem, for things are not as clear as they seem today. Your confusion could create real obstacles as the day progresses, adding to your discomfort. It's wise to make an important decision as soon as possible so you can stop worrying and start relaxing, instead."
gemini,2011-01-23,"Your schedule is as complicated as your thoughts today, but you're also quite likely to suffer from poor time management skills. Although you're a bit forgetful now; the real problem is that your energy is just spread too thin. Acknowledge the potential for opportunity wherever you see it, even if you can't take advantage of it easily. Don't make unnecessary commitments; having a bit of free time could be a very sweet thing."
cancer,2011-01-23,"Even if you feel pretty confident about yourself now, it's still difficult to gauge someone else's reaction to you. You might be ready to take dramatic action on an issue that's been of ongoing concern. Now, as you make your move, you cannot tell if you're having the impact you want. Don't worry if rave reviews aren't rushing in; it may take a while before you are able to see the positive results of your efforts."
leo,2011-01-23,"You are pleased when others acknowledge your creativity, but your ability to be self-expressive doesn't require anyone else's approval. Your motivation needs to come from within. Spending time running through old scripts of ""I wish I did"" or ""I wish I didn't"" isn't very useful today. They will only clutter your mind with uncertainty or regret. All you can do now is give it your best shot and then let go."
virgo,2011-01-23,"Even if you have a well-planned shopping list today, you still might make a poor decision that prevents you from getting what you need. But your current predicament doesn't mean that you won't have a fabulous day. It's just that you might want to escape your everyday responsibilities. Luckily, you'll be fine if you can set analytical thinking aside and just act from your heart."
libra,2011-01-23,"A casual friendship may deepen today as your key planet Venus forms a supportive sextile with stabilizing Saturn. However, your desires will run into a wall if you try too hard to force something to happen. There's really nothing you need to do but flirt gently with the edge and keep the possibilities alive. In a few days, you'll be able to better see the benefits of your current patience."
scorpio,2011-01-23,"You are intrigued by the idea of indulging in a fantasy, but you prefer acting one out in privacy, rather than under the spotlight where others can see. However, today your actions seem more public than usual, making it difficult to hide what you do from those who might pass judgment on you. Instead of wasting energy trying to keep your personal world separate from your professional associates, stand firm and hold on to the strength of your convictions."
sagittarius,2011-01-23,"Concentrating on an upcoming adventure can be extremely distracting today. Still, it's not a great day to finalize your plans because you don't want to be limited by constraints of the real world. Instead of trying to make a sensible choice now, you'll probably opt for the grand gesture. A trip across town just isn't the same as hiking through the high peaks of Tibet. Finding middle ground between fantasy and reality is your best route to happiness."
capricorn,2011-01-23,"You feel as if your goals are falling into place today as others join in and come to your rescue. You may have a strong desire to take care of the most basic chores now, like paying your bills or doing laundry. But you don't have sufficient concentration to follow through on a boring task. Instead of doing something that you're not going to finish, consider taking the day off and letting your imagination freely roam."
aquarius,2011-01-23,"You may be inspired by a friend or colleague who catches your eye and actually holds your attention for a while. Normally, you are determined enough to stick with your plan, but today something can distract you from your destination. Still, your ability to recognize what's important now helps to motivate you. Trust the flashes of intuition you receive and see where your attractions lead."
pisces,2011-01-23,"Be sure that you're very clear about what you're doing now, or your good intentions could be pulled off track by a simple twist of fate. Solid preparation and consistent execution of your plan is mandatory, but still may not be enough to avoid an unexpected surprise. If you find yourself wandering off course, just make the necessary adjustments later on. Do the best you can, but don't fight a battle that you cannot win."
aries,2011-01-24,"You are eager to go along with your friends today. Luckily, it's quite easy for you to set aside your own agenda while doing what makes the most sense for everyone involved. But you must take the time to figure out where others stand. Trusting them with your fate is difficult if your anxiety grows out of hand."
taurus,2011-01-24,"Establishing a new schedule for your diet and exercise routine can be tricky if you're secretly satisfied with your current state of affairs. However, today you may be more certain about what you want, yet still find it hard to motivate yourself to change. Gathering more information isn't necessary, for you probably already know enough. Anything you do now can lead to an improvement in your physical well-being, so take action while it counts."
gemini,2011-01-24,"You might think that everything will roll your way today, but the logistics become more difficult as time goes on. Even if it seems like there's a lot of fun just around the next corner, you can't think about playtime until you've handled your responsibilities. Fortunately, once you're finished with all your obligations, you're game for just about anything. Work extra hard so you have time to pursue something more pleasurable later on."
cancer,2011-01-24,"It's good news that you're feeling so flexible today because you may need to change your plans more than once. Domestic tension is building and you could be asked to step in and mediate a family disagreement. But the current problem isn't necessarily about someone being right and someone else being wrong. Concentrate your efforts on helping everyone reach common ground, even if your perspectives still differ on a fundamental issue."
leo,2011-01-24,"You are ready to manage a complex interaction with conflicting groups of people today. Although each is stoically holding on to different sets of interests, your intervention could be enough to shift the entire situation. On another day, you might be inclined to just give up and let it all play out on its own. Fortunately, you can maintain control now while still appearing as if you don't have your hands on the steering wheel."
virgo,2011-01-24,"Instead of questioning a recent decision, accept your previous judgment as being logically sound. It's already past the time to consider whether or not to proceed. You have moved beyond the point of no return, even if you're still experiencing some self-doubt. Instead of questioning your choices again and again, consciously shift your attention from the inner realms toward taking the next steps on your journey."
libra,2011-01-24,"Don't worry about making a final decision today; instead use your current uncertainty to express yourself in a creative manner. Sometimes it's important to demonstrate your leadership style by behaving with clear certainty, but now you will be appreciated even more if you are honest about your crisis of confidence. Be open and take whatever time is necessary to share your concerns rather than just leaving everyone in the dark."
scorpio,2011-01-24,"You are often tempted to sink into the recesses of your own subconscious mind. On occasion these journeys within are overwhelming and can pull you into deep waters that completely engulf you. Today, however, you are able to dance around the edges of the shadows with ease as the Moon travels through your 12th House of Imagination. Thankfully, you can glide through this phase if you don't make a big deal out of anything right now."
sagittarius,2011-01-24,"You may find yourself in a power struggle when dealing with friends today. However, some relationships can be positively impacted by the social Libra Moon's visit to your 11th House of Groups, where it alleviates some of the pressure you are under. It doesn't matter how you feel right now; just keep meeting your professional commitments with integrity and don't worry about coming out on top."
capricorn,2011-01-24,"Leading by example is especially challenging if you continue to change your mind from minute to minute. It's difficult to trust your decisions today, even if you have all the supporting data that you need to justify your choices. But don't get hung up trying to answer any one particular question. Just respond to the best of your current ability and be ready to move on."
aquarius,2011-01-24,"You seem more intense now as the Sun in your sign travels along with feisty Mars. The Sun-Mars combo is in eccentric Aquarius, receiving support from the Moon in fellow Air sign, Libra. However, you could also feel dreamier than usual, as if your fleeting whims have freed themselves by detaching from the weight of your body. Be bold and take action as needed; just remember that karmic Saturn will judge you harshly today if you believe that escape through fantasy is a viable option."
pisces,2011-01-24,"You still have a bit of magic up your sleeve today, and luckily it will be there when you need it most. Even if you are required to deal with powerful people who might be investing in your business, there's no reason to be intimidated. Just stay present with your truth, for maintaining your integrity sets the stage for managing serious issues that will demand resolution in the near future."
aries,2011-01-25,"You are wound so tightly today that you should seek ways to blow off some excess energy. You might think you'll be able to remain cool in an interaction with a friend, but engaging in a heated discussion is inevitable if safely defined roles break down. Unfortunately, flaring tempers won't make anyone happy. Consciously back down to avoid an unnecessary battle without trying to justify your position."
taurus,2011-01-25,"You know that you have a specific job to do, but you might not be able to figure out exactly what it is. You can lose focus today, but you don't need to worry about regaining it yet. Don't bother trying to make sense of your dreams; just let them reveal what you want to do in the world. It doesn't matter now if your newly discovered goals are practical or not. Just let them grow and develop a life of their own."
gemini,2011-01-25,"You may let a philosophy or a belief override your common sense now, without even knowing it. This obsession can be a major source of trouble with those around you. Most often your ideas are useful, but today they tend to alienate you, reinforcing your differences and not your similarities. Fortunately, your good intentions may be enough to lift others out of their doldrums. This positive energy reflects back to you by motivating you and giving you an instant boost of confidence."
cancer,2011-01-25,"You may think that you can instantly change your old habits today, especially if you see the outcome of your present situation in your mind's eye. Unfortunately, you could become overly possessive and try to hold on to your own past, if it appears that someone is attempting to take something away from you. Give yourself permission to relax while enjoying the present moment, no matter what happens."
leo,2011-01-25,"You cannot understand anyone else's motives very clearly today because you are looking at the world through rose-colored glasses. Your eagerness to aggressively defend yourself or someone you love is admirable, but your current intensity can complicate things even more. Don't be so quick to fight for your beliefs. Wait a few days to see if your point of view changes before escalating a difference of opinion into an open conflict."
virgo,2011-01-25,"It's easy to keep your energy focused today because the Sun and Mars both fall in your 6th House of Details. Even with the clearest of intentions, it's nearly impossible to know why you are heading on your current path. But this isn't a time to question your motivation. Simple action is all that's required now to make progress toward your goal."
libra,2011-01-25,"The Moon's visit to your sign today reminds you to stay connected with the sources of inspiration in your life. The Moon symbolizes the matrix of support that flows through family and creates intimacy. If you're overly idealistic about love now, you might experience disappointment. However, maintaining your integrity is more important than anything else."
scorpio,2011-01-25,"You are living under a magical spell that could date all the way back to your childhood days. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell which memories are based upon truth and which ones are fully fabricated from the depths of your unconscious mind. It can be helpful to be a detective when it comes to your heart because once you get to the bottom of the situation, your feelings are a lot easier to sort out."
sagittarius,2011-01-25,"Slowing down and establishing a sustainable pace enables you to accomplish a lot more than you expect today. However, before starting a new project now, it's imperative to have your thoughts in order. Take time to think your strategy all the way through before you do anything at all. You can save yourself from a headache by doing your homework first."
capricorn,2011-01-25,"You want more clarity to make an important financial decision today, yet, thankfully, your current window of opportunity will last for a few more days. It's challenging to respond to a professional dilemma because a temporary loss of self-confidence can muddle your thinking even more. There's no need to worry; your optimism will surely return again. In the meantime, don't make any major decisions until you're sure that you are ready."
aquarius,2011-01-25,"You may feel a strong rebellious streak within and wonder if you'll be able to keep it in check. Your desire to be impulsive increases through Feb. 4, as the Sun-Mars conjunction reaches fruition. Meanwhile, action-hero Mars comes to your rescue; even if you are having a tricky time knowing what to do with your physical energy. A high-intensity workout today could make all the difference in the world."
pisces,2011-01-25,"The Moon forms a sweet trine to your key planet Neptune today, placing you in touch with the depths of your imagination. However, you are also receiving an energetic boost from Mars, operating behind the scenes from your 12th House of Secrets. Other people may not even know that there is magic brewing within your mind. Let your fantasies run wild; your creativity will break through the surface soon enough."
aries,2011-01-26,"Analyzing ways to improve a current relationship today won't necessarily help to make it any better, but it might be a good first step. The solution may seem hopeless when you consider what you must do to get where you want to go. Don't be so hard on yourself or others; instead try revising your expectations. You may be much closer to your goal than you realize."
taurus,2011-01-26,"You may need to do some emotional cleanup because of an interaction with a difficult person yesterday, yet you might be puzzled by the apparent lack of progress today. However, you must realize that productivity isn't always measured by what happens on the surface. You are processing changes in small ways even if you are unaware of it, so don't be overly concerned if you seem to have stalled for no reason."
gemini,2011-01-26,"There is always room for self-improvement, and changes in your diet and exercise program may be exactly what you need now. Unfortunately, nothing is as straightforward as it ought to be when self-discipline is involved. Finding time to attend to your needs could be harder than you think. Remember, there's no need to struggle; instead of making yourself crazy by taking on too much, scale back and simplify your life."
cancer,2011-01-26,"You would like to put your best foot forward today, but things are not as rosy as they appear. You could easily channel so much of your energy into wearing a cheerful face that you end up exhausting yourself trying. It's not worth the effort if you end up so depleted that you can't enjoy yourself later. You don't need to pretend; others will accept you the way you are."
leo,2011-01-26,"Opening doors for other people has become a recent pastime as you advise them how to take advantage of upcoming opportunities. Although they may succeed, it's becoming more difficult to see potential in your own life because some things seem bleaker than they once were. Nevertheless, you don't have time to waste, so set aside any self-doubt. Instead, aim your sights on a realistic target and get to work."
virgo,2011-01-26,"Your intuition leads you to the conclusion that you'll be facing complex situations that involve others, but you may not be ready to turn your life upside down yet. In fact, you might try to minimize your current frustration by avoiding meaningful discussions about issues that have no immediate solutions. However, this strategy won't work now. Nevertheless, you can still delve into a relationship dilemma without making matters worse as long as you don't make any long-lasting decisions today."
libra,2011-01-26,"You may be overwhelmed by the mixed signals you are receiving today. One moment, all systems are go. But, then, just a few minutes later, everything is on hold. Although you could act impulsively and try to fix what's wrong, this reaction probably would be a mistake. Instead, think about which changes might make the most sense, but then wait until tomorrow to see what improves on its own."
scorpio,2011-01-26,"It's a challenge for you to understand why others don't trust you enough to support your strategy, even though you are so optimistic about the outcome. Ironically, it's probably your over-the-top confidence that can put some people off because they think you're hiding self-doubt. Even if it's uncomfortable at first, it's still better to be honest about your strengths and limitations right from the start."
sagittarius,2011-01-26,"Sometimes life's difficult because it feels as if you know more than you should. Today you are caught between your desire to inform others of the obvious facts they are missing and your duty to do as you are told. Becoming a whistleblower may be the morally correct action, but it might also make life more stressful on the job. Do whatever it takes to survive and keep in mind that harsh practicality can outweigh even the greatest ideals."
capricorn,2011-01-26,"Projecting your thoughts far into the future may be your idea of fun with the Moon visiting your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams. You are ready to take everything to the next level, but an obstacle may arrive in the form of someone who has the power to say ""no."" Unfortunately, you are only willing to respond to ""yes."" Fortunately, your sincere effort could loosen Saturn's current rigid position. Planning time is over; roll up your sleeves and get to work."
aquarius,2011-01-26,"You may be running out of time, yet there's still so much more for you to do today. Thankfully, you are driven to get everything done and not much can stop your momentum. Nevertheless, you still might feel as if you aren't receiving the support you deserve from those who could be of help. Don't play the role of a victim; no matter what, keep moving your idea forward."
pisces,2011-01-26,"The Moon in your 9th House of Travel may be heating up your desire to go on an adventure, but your plans could crash into the reality of previous work commitments. Even if you believe that you can juggle your schedule and make everything fall into place, it's becoming apparent that your path is blocked for some inexplicable reason. Don't overcompensate by canceling your plans because the outlook could change quickly. Wait for the energy to shift before deciding what to do next."
aries,2011-01-27,"Your current optimism about the future motivates you to swing into action, yet it also distracts you from what's happening right in front of your nose. You could be eager to shift your focus away from a complicated emotional situation that would benefit from your undivided attention today. Just remember that a positive attitude can be helpful as long as you don't forget to use your common sense in the process."
taurus,2011-01-27,"You may feel as if you have finally broken through the resistance that's been holding you back. Luckily, you now have an opportunity to change your life for the better. You have an upbeat approach and are certain that you're moving along the right path, even if the current circumstances suggest otherwise. Hold on to your dreams, for your self-confidence may be your greatest asset at this time."
gemini,2011-01-27,"You may feel irritated with the intensity of your own feelings today, but you just can't make them disappear. You might be fearful that there isn't an easy way out of an entangled situation, and even with your mental agility, you still cannot rationalize your reaction. Stop resisting your emotions; sink into them instead. You will have time later to revisit your experience and logically plan what to do next."
cancer,2011-01-27,"You may have one great idea after another today, yet you're likely to keep them to yourself. It isn't that you're insecure about sharing your thoughts; you actually think that you're moving in the right direction. It's just that you believe that your plans are still developing and are not yet solid enough to talk about with anyone else. Don't feel obliged to say anything until you are ready."
leo,2011-01-27,An unexpected interaction with a friend or a new acquaintance can raise your level of self-confidence today. The faith that someone else has in you now may exceed the belief you have in yourself. But you don't necessarily suffer from low self-esteem; it's just that you must stretch to fulfill other people's expectations of you. Don't waste your time feeding your doubts. Your uncertainty doesn't have to slow you down in the pursuit of your goals.
virgo,2011-01-27,"You might not trust your own assessment of a situation today, for even the impossible looks doable. It's great to be confident about your own capabilities, but it's not smart to ignore what's really happening. Although your key planet Mercury is buzzing from its connection to enthusiastic Jupiter to bolster your morale, your logical mind isn't taken in by the good news. Be patient; clarity will return in time for you to make the best decision."
libra,2011-01-27,"You are wiser to build on what you have already started, rather than initiating a new project now. However, you still could be tempted to skip over a step or two in your haste. Your judgment isn't as clear as you think now, so slow down your timeline. Delaying your responses allows you to consider the practicality of your actions before you jump in too far. Less hurrying today means less worrying tomorrow."
scorpio,2011-01-27,"Today's magnetic Scorpio Moon turns up the heat on your desires, but you still might not be ready to share your feelings. You often hide your emotions when you believe that they might make others uncomfortable, yet you are thinking about trying a different tactic today. Talk about what you want, but don't get overly attached to the outcome. Instead of making anyone else responsible, just express your needs. You may be pleasantly surprised by what happens next."
sagittarius,2011-01-27,"Your key planet Jupiter is dazzled by trickster Mercury today, challenging you to concentrate on the demanding mundane affairs of your life. You must deal with what's happening in your immediate environment, even if it's not as much fun as dreaming about the future. But no one can see what you're thinking, so you can continue exploring your unexpressed fantasies as long as you cover your bases in the present moment."
capricorn,2011-01-27,"You may not be on the same page as your friends today. It's not that you're trying to be different; it's just that you feel strongly about something that highlights an unresolved issue. Tread carefully, for the harder you attempt to get to the bottom of the disagreement, the wider the gulf becomes. Thankfully, this split doesn't need to be fixed right away; give the situation some breathing room and things will begin to heal on their own."
aquarius,2011-01-27,"You may feel overstimulated today. Every little thing that bubbles into your awareness brings cascades of thoughts along with it. Every new idea tempts you to swing into action. However, you can't easily separate the reality of your day from your desire to help save the world. Ultimately, there's no need to confine your thinking now; observe your inner process and watch as the very smallest details magically merge with your global perspective."
pisces,2011-01-27,"You could feel so overwhelmed today that you just want to rest now. Your mind may be racing so fast that you can't quiet the flow of ideas, whether they are useful or not. Don't try to catch any single thought and turn it into something practical. Instead, just let the mental currents rush through your mind and rest assured that the most important concepts won't be lost."
aries,2011-01-28,"Although you may feel happy in the morning, stress could develop later in the afternoon. Your feelings might mislead you now and tempt you to ignore the problems you must face. Don't attempt to sidestep serious issues by taking the easy way out. The power of positive thinking is useful to a point, but shutting out the truth today won't resolve your anxiety about the future."
taurus,2011-01-28,"You may outwardly acknowledge your desire for love, but this doesn't mean you're ready to follow up your words with whatever's necessary to create a lasting relationship. You try to look good in your partner's eyes and you might even be successful today at magically pulling a rabbit out of a hat. However, it's senseless to push your luck, or you might find yourself overextended without a simple way home. Ironically, slowing down is a quicker route to intimacy."
gemini,2011-01-28,"A good friend may be quite an extraordinary catalyst in your life today as he or she reminds you that you can do almost anything that you set your mind to. Nevertheless, you may downplay a professional opportunity by rushing into something completely different so you can avoid disappointing someone else. Stay aware of your strengths and weaknesses and remember that there's no need to make any excuses to justify your choices."
cancer,2011-01-28,"You may act more adventurous today and choose to open a door you might otherwise walk by without even noticing it. At first, your excitement is empowering and you feel very alive from your current experience. But don't worry if you have second thoughts about your burst of bravado. Instead of suppressing your feelings, lean firmly into the unknown. Your uncertainty could transform into a beautiful agent for change."
leo,2011-01-28,"Fun-loving play can turn serious today, but a change in mood is not a good enough reason to pull away from someone you love. Of course, many other significant issues come into view now, prompting you to shut down emotionally, especially if you were previously acting too aggressive. Don't let your fears interfere with your plans. If you can remember to listen to your heart, there could be good news waiting at your doorstep."
virgo,2011-01-28,"Your personal life has merged with your professional world, but you still may feel somewhat restrained today as you attempt to limit your energy to what's going on between you and a co-worker or friend. Your life may seem like it's full of static; everywhere you turn there's more information coming in and your senses are temporarily overwhelmed by the noise. Step back from all the commotion; reclaiming your objectivity is a smart way to restore your vitality and tune up your resonance."
libra,2011-01-28,"You are quite animated today, especially if you are enjoying what you do. Thankfully, you probably don't need to fake a good time because things are falling into place for you. Still, you might be asked to give a little extra effort to kick off something new. Luckily, you should be able to deliver the goods, so don't give up if you run into a problem. Persistence is your key now and its positive impact cannot be ignored."
scorpio,2011-01-28,"Your window of unrestrained creativity may be closing soon, so don't procrastinate now. Look into your recent past to see what you've already accomplished and make a list of what still needs to be done. Concentrate on finishing up old projects today; don't wait for a better time because this may be your best shot. Take advantage of the opportunity while it's staring you in the face."
sagittarius,2011-01-28,"If others ask you how you are doing, you naturally want to tell them the whole story. You may be the straightforward type, but remember that some things should be kept to yourself. Proceed with caution because your powers of discrimination are not working very well now. Don't trust your own judgment today as your sense of proportion is bent out of shape. To be safe, say as little as possible until your clarity returns."
capricorn,2011-01-28,"You tend to oversimplify everything today, and could even underestimate the time and money required to finish a long-term project. Nevertheless, set aside any logical reasons that have kept you from completing a job. There isn't any need to make a fuss over a deadline that will probably be missed anyway. Forget about making excuses; just jump in and get busy."
aquarius,2011-01-28,"Your intuitive boundaries are shifting, allowing you to see far into the future and revealing additional room to stretch your mind. Nevertheless, this change might also create a false sense of exhilaration. Tread carefully today; it's challenging to get along without the support of your peers. However, it's your own attitude that can make the biggest difference, so remain as confident as you can while you test your wings."
pisces,2011-01-28,"Your dreams about where your career path is leading can be derailed today as someone challenges your capability. Fortunately, you are wise enough to steer yourself in the right direction. But your imagination may trick you into making your plan so outrageous that it becomes unwieldy. Pay attention to the fine line that distinguishes reality from fantasy to achieve the best outcome."
aries,2011-01-29,"On one level it seems as if everything is going your way today, but there is more happening than is apparent. Others see you as competent and your actions as straightforward, but you may be more uncertain than they realize. It's okay that you have a lot going on within the realms of your imagination now. Your dreams are motivational, as long as you continue to clearly distinguish between reality and fantasy."
taurus,2011-01-29,"There's a lot to finish at work today and you're determined to deliver on what you promised. Push as hard as you can early in the day, for you may grow weary sooner than you expect. Fortunately, you are able to handle everything that is being thrown at you, even if you inadvertently get involved in more than you should. But remember to take some time off once you complete your tasks; being extra nice to yourself this evening is a just reward for a job well done."
gemini,2011-01-29,"Someone may come to your rescue today, whether you need the assistance or not. But in any case, accepting help is wise because it can deepen the bond of friendship. Don't worry if another person's involvement actually reduces your efficiency. Ultimately, it's not about increasing your production; it's about improving your relationships."
cancer,2011-01-29,"Performing your job well feels exceptionally satisfying today. You don't even need acknowledgment from others; the fruit of your labor is reward enough for you now. But fulfillment may be elusive if you think that you should be pursuing a different line of work. Fortunately, opportunities are lurking right at the edge of your awareness, and if you are clever enough you could turn one of them into a new direction in your current career."
leo,2011-01-29,"Although you could sail through the day with a smile on your face, it's just as easy to channel your positive attitude into a creative endeavor. Either way, it's an uplifting time, but you might as well have something to show off when all is said and done. Don't be tempted to isolate yourself from everyone else; working with others now can lead you in an unexpected direction."
virgo,2011-01-29,"You cannot approach your work in the same manner as you did earlier in the week, for the old methods are not as effective anymore. Thankfully, you could get inspired and come up with an entirely new and original way of doing your job. Don't worry if your idea is the best one or not. For now, just trying something different may be enough to break the ice and stir the energy in a slightly different direction."
libra,2011-01-29,"You could find yourself on a creative roll today, but you'll have to take a risk in order to get the most from it. It's important to keep yourself motivated, for if you become lazy, you might miss a significant opportunity. Forget about the tried and true path to success. If you want to accomplish something extraordinary now, you must set your comfort aside, step out of the box and do something you've never done before."
scorpio,2011-01-29,"This could be a much better day than you anticipated as something nice comes your way. Of course, any unexpected pleasant experience would be welcome, but finding a bargain, receiving a cash windfall or making a new friend could have a lasting positive impact on your life. However, you must be in a receptive frame of mind or the good news might pass you by unnoticed."
sagittarius,2011-01-29,"The Moon's conjunction with lovely Venus in your sign this evening is a harbinger of love, money and pleasure. Naturally, these are all wonderful possibilities, but sweet experiences won't automatically manifest in your life unless you set the stage for their expression. Your acts of generosity will be returned, but probably not quite as you expect."
capricorn,2011-01-29,"You may be feeling good today, but it's difficult to put your finger on the source of your optimism. It's as if you know something positive is going to happen, but you don't know what it is or why you are so sure of it. Don't waste a lot of time trying to analyze your instincts now; instead, act as if your hunch is correct. Your belief may be enough to alter your future."
aquarius,2011-01-29,"The Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Friends and Associates can light up your social calendar. Her evening conjunction with stylish Venus may actually improve your popularity, but not if you seem too pushy, so don't try too hard to be included. You could exude more power than you realize now and your assertive style might seem aggressive unless you consciously tone down your behavior. A low-key approach makes you more desirable at this time."
pisces,2011-01-29,"On the surface, it appears to be all about your career now, but the winds of fate are blowing from unusual directions and can carry you toward an unexpected destination. Fortunately, the outcome is likely to be better than you think, so don't resist the shifting currents. Keep your spirits up; even if you're heading into unknown territory, your thoughts are creating your tomorrow before it arrives."
aries,2011-01-30,"You may try to balance your obligations with your need for adventure when the Moon enters responsible Capricorn today. Although circumstances can bring you back down to earth, you're not necessarily willing to let go of the unrealistic hopes that brighten your future. Remain cautious but optimistic; you can manage the tension if you stay aware of both extremes as the tightrope is stretched between your desires and your commitments."
taurus,2011-01-30,"If you are struggling with unrealistic aspirations, today could bring a series of reality checks that helps you to regain your footing in the world. But until you know exactly where you stand, you won't be able to get on with the important business of reorganizing your life. Use this time to create or improve a practical plan and then get down to the work of making your dreams come true."
gemini,2011-01-30,"You may not be used to taking everything so seriously, but fortunately, you are a fast learner. Even if you try to be more casual as you make your plans, a carefree attitude won't work now. You must set priorities and focus your attention on the most important issues, so you can reevaluate your overall strategy before committing to the wrong approach. Don't be afraid to make adjustments as needed. If you can concentrate through the early part of the day, you might just get a jumpstart on what's to follow."
cancer,2011-01-30,"You may have a full plate today if you have to deal with an intense person who just wants to push your emotional buttons. Perhaps the tension in a personal relationship becomes too much, or maybe you have a run-in with a workmate. Don't retreat, even if this interaction is stressful right from the start. Something good will come of your persistence; there is a silver lining even in the darkest of clouds."
leo,2011-01-30,"If you have a lot riding on a rocky relationship, there could be positive movement today. Although it may not turn out as wonderful as you hope, there is an upside to what is happening. One thing is certain: whatever you are currently doing will require diligence and patience. There is much to discuss and the more you talk things over now, the easier it will be later on."
virgo,2011-01-30,"One minute you're mourning a loss and the next moment you're celebrating a victory. Contradictory currents wash back and forth across your life, making it nearly impossible to get the clarity you want. You can sense the potential impact of your actions these days, so you may not be in a very playful mood. Whatever you decide to do, don't let go of the reins."
libra,2011-01-30,"You may start the day with irrepressible excitement because there are so many interesting possibilities ahead. However, the truth begins to settle in as the day unfolds, and your personal situation may not look as good. Don't throw in the towel too quickly, for there's still some serious magic brewing. Be careful; a defeatist attitude could ruin everything. Your unwavering belief in yourself is the key to your success."
scorpio,2011-01-30,"Although acting cautiously could help you to feel safe and secure today, you may not be able to restrain your optimism. Fortunately, something happens that makes you realize the power of positive thought more than ever before. But consciously applying your faith isn't enough; you have to scope out the big picture and decide how to organize all the pieces in order to achieve the desired results. Establish realistic goals and then slowly work toward reaching them."
sagittarius,2011-01-30,"The Moon's square to your key planet Jupiter today magnifies everything, convincing you that something is better than it actually is. Fortunately, you still will be able to discern the difference between blind optimism and true vision if you pay attention to the signs. Don't question your intuition now; just listen to your inner voice as it guides you through the current obstacle course and toward your destination."
capricorn,2011-01-30,"You may feel as if you're being bounced all over the emotional map, but this can be a very important day for you, now that the Moon is back in your sign. You want to do things your way today, which could involve exerting control. Even if you are striving toward an uplifting goal, you might become so involved in your process that you alienate someone you love. You don't have to be so hard on others in order to motivate them to do their best."
aquarius,2011-01-30,"There is so much to do today because you said yes too many times. Nevertheless, you aren't discouraged by the sacrifices you'll need to make, nor will any obstacles scare you off. You are convinced that your goals are attainable and you're ready to do whatever is necessary to achieve them. Just remember that stability is still elusive, so your plans could take a bit longer to unfold than you realize."
pisces,2011-01-30,"If someone has been standing in your way, you are strong enough now to overcome the resistance placed in your path. Although you are a dreamer, you're also wise in a pragmatic way now. Employ your imagination to visualize your success as a done deal. But instead of relying on the wings of a prayer to carry you along, organize your resources and work steadily toward your goal."
aries,2011-01-31,"You aren't eager to slow down, but you wisely understand that expending all your energy to make small gains today might not be such a good idea. You are being challenged to accomplish everything that you set out to do now. However, it's smarter to take it easy, rather than frantically fighting an uphill battle all day and still ending up discouraged because you didn't reach your destination. Instead of attempting to finish what you begin, just lay a solid foundation for what's to follow."
taurus,2011-01-31,"You might be upset today when you realize how much you have sacrificed to get what you want. However, your decision has already been made and there's no going back now. Although you may wish that you did things differently, you have another important choice to make in the present moment. Don't let desperation trick you into making a bad decision; if you're going to take a risk, make sure you first calculate your chances for success."
gemini,2011-01-31,"Now that the workweek has started, you may not be able to socialize with your friends, but you'll want to have some fun anyhow. Instead of trying to do everything, you'll benefit the most from being very methodical today. Set priorities early in the day and then stick to your plan. If you get a lot done by quitting time, you can shift gears and squeeze in some playtime later in the evening."
cancer,2011-01-31,"If you recently acquiesced to an authority figure, now it's time to pull in the reins and reassert control of your life. Finally, it's your turn to play the role of the fearless leader; your failure to step up to the plate and claim your power will leave room for someone less qualified to take charge. Fortunately, you can act with compassion, so there's no need to be critical of anyone. It's crucial to seize the moment, stand up for yourself and state your beliefs. If you don't do it, no one else will."
leo,2011-01-31,"You may feel anxious today, and your uneasiness can get the best of you if you have been working hard to put a relationship in order. Even if you made inroads recently, there still may be something that's not exactly right. Although you could be overwhelmed with all the stress, don't throw in the towel yet. You have already come through the hardest part, but it will take more time to see how much progress has already occurred."
virgo,2011-01-31,"You would be wise to get closure on a creative project now, even if you don't want it to be finished. Taking stock of the recent changes you made at home or at work makes practical sense now. But before you initiate action, think about adjustments you can make that would improve the quality of your life right away. Don't try to handle the bigger issues now; just concentrate on cherishing the little things that bring you joy."
libra,2011-01-31,"You might have a bad taste in your mouth concerning a recent emotional entanglement you had with a family member or an intimate partner. Everything seemed to be patched up and on the mend, but now you are realizing that your needs have been left out of the equation. Unfortunately, this scenario may have a familiar ring to it. Nevertheless, the conversation isn't quite over. And it's surely not too late to make a stand for something that's important to you."
scorpio,2011-01-31,"Your unflappable determination sees you through some sticky situations. Once you've made up your mind, it's easy for you to do what must be done. Nevertheless, something could happen in your immediate environment today that tests you in a way you weren't expecting. However, if you truly believe in yourself and are willing to put in the extra effort, you can rise to the occasion. Don't back down; you are closer to an important victory than you think."
sagittarius,2011-01-31,"The Moon's challenging square to austere Saturn may put you in direct conflict with an authority figure at work. Your boss might not acknowledge your needs so you'll have to overcome his or her narrow thinking. Your smartest strategy is to consciously lessen your own intensity to give everyone the time and space to recover any lost equilibrium. For now, less is actually better than more when asking for what you want."
capricorn,2011-01-31,"Suppressed anger stands between you and your happiness today, but unconsciously expressing negativity might also bring you down. However, you can begin to transmute your awkward feelings into positive actions by simply shifting your perspective. Your confidence will return once you see that there are more options available. But don't fall victim to taking an unnecessary risk; cautious optimism offers the best chance for success."
aquarius,2011-01-31,"You feel as if you're in the final stages of preparation, but you might not yet know what you're getting ready for. It's probably too late to reconsider your plans for the week, so just follow through on what you already decided. But you have more power at your disposal than you realize. Don't talk yourself out of a victory; instead, pick a cause, set your priorities and stir up a bit of trouble. Others will recognize you as a force to be reckoned with and will treat you with the respect you deserve."
pisces,2011-01-31,"You might consider making a quick escape today because interactions with others seem too stressful. However, working alone or playing solo is not the best use of the Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Teamwork. Your participation in a social group could be quite liberating now. You can derive benefits from setting your needs aside and merging with a group, rather than retreating into your own world."
aries,2011-02-01,"Sudden surges of energy can catch you off guard today, yet you may attempt to suppress your new ideas, especially if you are already feeling insecure. Something tells you to shake everything up by putting your radical plan in motion. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem worth the risk. Trusting your intuition is the smartest thing you can do now. If your concept is worthwhile, it will still be valid in a few days."
taurus,2011-02-01,"You are feeling somewhat smug today because you already know an important piece of information that others have yet to discover. Your friends might be buzzing around, trying to finish everything right away, but you realize that everyone has more time than they think to wrap things up. Keep in mind that you can't make anyone else see the truth, but you can put it to work for yourself."
gemini,2011-02-01,You could get so worked up today that you ride roughshod over those around you unless you stop and think first. It's challenging to see what's really happening because your healthiest options could be obscured by your desire to succeed at your current task. Don't lose your natural gift of flexibility; be ready to change direction when new possibilities appear.
cancer,2011-02-01,"A casual interaction with someone today may start off simply and eventually turn into a tangled web of emotions. Fortunately, you might feel supported by a close friend, which makes the whole thing worthwhile. Remember, extreme gestures won't likely have the impact you want. Rein in your actions and concentrate on small victories, instead of worrying about things you cannot change."
leo,2011-02-01,"It seems as if others are encouraging you to go in a direction that's not your preference, but resisting their efforts can raise additional issues. Nevertheless, being overly agreeable to minimize conflict won't work. You must make a stand now, even if you create some ripples. Stick to specific details; discussing general concepts will only weaken your position today."
virgo,2011-02-01,"You might try to accomplish more than is possible today, but you believe that it's all manageable as long as you organize your thoughts first. Luckily, you have a natural gift for making lists, but now you could benefit from filling in more details than usual. Working hard throughout the day should bring positive results, but additional preparation makes you even more successful."
libra,2011-02-01,"You might be able to tap into a vein of creativity this week with the radiant Sun and expressive Mars visiting your 5th House of Self-Expression. Don't be concerned about the outcome; just get started and let the inner artist or musician take over. Ultimately, it's not about what you produce; it's about how passionate you feel during the act of creation."
scorpio,2011-02-01,"Your current ability to juggle cool intellectual detachment and passionate emotional involvement might confuse everyone else today, but you can navigate through complicated interpersonal dynamics with the greatest of ease. You may appear as graceful as a dancer, but you still must manage your intensity wisely. Thankfully, you can accomplish a lot if you don't let your attention wander away from what's most important."
sagittarius,2011-02-01,"If you are looking forward to a quiet weekend, you may be sorely disappointed. You might be able to manage the noise level for a while, but everything can quickly grow out of hand. Don't bother trying to resist the distracting waves of incoming energy, for the diversions can be interesting and fun. Give yourself permission to surrender to the excitement. You can always rest later on."
capricorn,2011-02-01,"You may be feeling grouchy today, as if you woke up on the wrong side of the bed. You aren't very happy with the current circumstances, yet your critical assessment may be out of place now. Taking a more fluid position will help you find the right way to express yourself. Sometimes all you need to do is let others know that you're thinking about them. Anyway, frowning requires much more effort than smiling, so relax and enjoy the present moment as much as you can."
aquarius,2011-02-01,"You may be feeling the pressure to finish a project that has been delayed for too long. Now, however, you are running out of valid excuses. But this isn't the only reason to jump in and get the job done. It's true that sometimes procrastination really does serve a purpose. But you can't avoid the inevitable forever; you'll feel much better after you cross this task off your list."
pisces,2011-02-01,"Although you are being told to finish up your chores before doing anything else, this can still be a great day for a brief escape. Instead of attempting to take time off to go sunning on a tropical island retreat, do something small like going to a concert or visiting an art exhibit. Treat yourself by setting aside some personal time for a special experience, even if your break can't last all that long."
aries,2011-02-02,"Even if you are eager to blast ahead and begin something new, you'll be much better off if you start slowly today. You may feel frustrated if you try to involve too many people in your personal process now, instead of just continuing ahead at your own pace. Focus on your long-term goals to maintain a healthy perspective. Fortunately, concentrating on the distant horizon allows you to conserve your energy for when you need it most."
taurus,2011-02-02,"Your unusual ideas at work today could surprise everyone, because making wild plans is usually out of character for you. But even your most original and craziest thoughts are probably more conservative than they seem at first. Luckily, you have plenty of stamina to finish whatever you start. Nevertheless, be wise and make sure that you aren't overcommitting your time or resources before it's too late."
gemini,2011-02-02,"You are often comfortable changing direction in the middle of a project. Now, the lightning of awareness strikes and you are tempted to try a new approach to reach a current goal. Although you may be ready to readjust your plans today, everyone else might not be so easily swayed. Don't expect others to quickly jump on board. Give them time and they might join you once they know more about what you are doing."
cancer,2011-02-02,"An inheritance of some sort may become more complicated than you expect if others don't share your goals at work. They might approve of your actions, yet still disagree with your philosophy or your objectives. Unfortunately, it's not very clear where their support ends, for those in control appear to be enthusiastic about something you're doing. Make your next move very carefully and don't depend on others for any more than they are willing to give."
leo,2011-02-02,"Today's Aquarius New Moon activates your 7th House of Others, and relationships continue to be a hotspot for you. However, it's difficult to distinguish your outer world from your imagination. Those closest to you become like mirrors in a carnival fun house, challenging you to separate what's really there from what you believe you see. Don't rely solely on your senses, instead, try acting on what's in your heart."
virgo,2011-02-02,"Although you may be highly dependent on the regularity of your everyday routines, someone could upset the apple cart now. Whatever stability existed in your world may be temporarily threatened. But instead of responding too quickly and trying to put everything back in place, wait until the energy settles back down before doing anything of significance. This is not a test of your reaction speed; it's a lesson in patience."
libra,2011-02-02,"Something finally breaks loose today. Your restrained river of creativity could burst, sending a flow of big ideas and original visions into your awareness. The real issue is about expressing your experiences in a manner that others will be able to understand. Your need to be seen and appreciated is strong now, so don't be afraid to let others know what's going on in your imagination."
scorpio,2011-02-02,"You could spend a lot of energy today resisting your connection to the past. However, your attempts at avoidance could actually have the exact opposite effect. Don't bother trying to escape from family dynamics now, even if you have no actual communication with anyone at all. Fortunately, once you recognize that your historic bonds are part of your reality, it becomes easier to manage your emotions without falling into the trap of psychological denial."
sagittarius,2011-02-02,"Your siblings or best friends may play a more important role in your life these days. You might even inadvertently pull in someone to play out your issues about dependency versus independence. It seems as if others aren't sure how close to get to you or how long to stay. But on further examination, it appears that they are just following your lead. Show them what's most important by opening your heart and being real."
capricorn,2011-02-02,"Working extra hard usually gives you a way to justify yourself while your above average productivity increases your self-esteem. However, you may not have to do a lot today just to see how much others love you. Don't waste time questioning your perceptions. Accept your positive outlook as the way things are and be grateful for the life you are living."
aquarius,2011-02-02,"You are like a lightning rod today, attracting storms wherever you go. If the thunderclap doesn't shock you awake, the flash of light will open your eyes as it reveals what's within your range of vision. For a while, wherever your thoughts are aimed, your mind locks on to that path. So pay careful attention to your current direction and stay flexible enough to make adjustments when needed."
pisces,2011-02-02,"The New Moon activates your 12th House of Imagination, changing the channels on the TV set of your mind so fast that you don't even know what happened. One minute all is copasetic, but then your thoughts jump into a new realm, leaving you without an easy way back to your starting point. Don't struggle; once you accept the inevitability of change, you can go anywhere your dreams take you."
aries,2011-02-03,"You may be adamant about making your impossible dream come true, and today nothing is totally out of the question. Your irrational fantasies might seem ridiculous to others, but you are fully capable of something extraordinary now if you can stay focused on your ambitions. Still, it's healthier to concentrate on a future that has a strong practical side to it as well. Keeping your feet on the ground gives you the traction necessary to reach your destination."
taurus,2011-02-03,"You can feel the stress between your thoughts that pull you into new territory and your common sense that holds you exactly right where you are. Although you may be motivated by financial and emotional security, you can still be lured by an unfamiliar tune floating through your mind. Even if you are curious enough to explore a new melody, don't stop listening to the songs that keep you grounded. You don't have to go over the edge in order to keep progressing toward the future."
gemini,2011-02-03,"You could feel clever throughout the day, as if a magical potion somehow made you more intelligent. But don't get so enamored with your ability to maneuver around any problem, for rational thinking can be a trap of its own. Instead of relying on cool logic, let your passions take you on a wild ride so you can see a different path into your future."
cancer,2011-02-03,"You may be tempted to withdraw into a world of fantasy, for your thoughts float into imaginative realms today, where you are not bound by reality. At the same time, you cannot get away from your close friends and family who keep bringing you back to the present moment, making it difficult for you to fully escape. Resign yourself to keeping one foot in this world and one in the other by balancing your dreams with the current circumstances."
leo,2011-02-03,"You are able to consider the pros and cons of a partnership with an uncharacteristic coolness that makes it easier for you to see things differently. Personal and business connections are likely to be a source of anxiety, but don't let this take you down a path of doubt. You can easily step outside of your normal subjectivity, which can give you a new perspective. Don't make any sudden changes; just integrate what you are learning into what you already know."
virgo,2011-02-03,"You may be in the process of reviewing how to change your daily regimen for the year ahead, and creating a list might be right up your alley. Write down every tiny change that you can think of that could have an uplifting impact on your life. But actions speak louder than words, so set priorities and get started with your new program for a healthier and happier you."
libra,2011-02-03,"You are brimming with ideas about which chores you should start today, but you still may try to avoid doing too much. Even if you initially planned to go to work, you might prefer to give yourself a real day off, instead. Then again, it's even better if you can find a natural rhythm and get into a creative flow. Being productive is important on other days, but now it's crucial to find an innovative way to express yourself playfully."
scorpio,2011-02-03,"Your emotional intensity begins to settle down today, but you still are not that interested in hiding your gut reaction to a stressful family situation. You aren't trying to seek melodrama, but neither are you willing to ignore the facts as you see them. Don't worry so much about being nice to everyone; focus on sharing nothing but the truth, instead."
sagittarius,2011-02-03,"You prefer taking action when you are feeling more confident than you are today. Although you may intuitively know what's right, it isn't always the same as your logical choice. Making up your mind could be stressful now, unless you accept some uncertainty along with your decision. Determine what makes the most sense to the best of your ability and move on. You can always modify your position later on if absolutely necessary."
capricorn,2011-02-03,"Trickster Mercury enters your 2nd House of Personal Belongings today, indicating that you might grow very concerned about what you own. You may even feel threatened, as if someone is attempting to take something important away from you. Don't let your natural urge to protect what's yours turn into paranoia. If you are anxious, discuss your worries with your friends, but remember to actually listen to the feedback you receive."
aquarius,2011-02-03,"Logical Mercury enters your intellectual sign today, electrifying your conversations with clever wit and increasing your overall gift of gab. Talking your way out of a difficult situation is a mixed blessing now because it also increases the chances of getting yourself into trouble. Don't get hooked by your own intelligence and act like a know-it-all. Even if you're brilliant, you still have something to learn, just like everyone else."
pisces,2011-02-03,"You believe that your perceptions are very clear today, and, in fact, your senses may be acutely sensitive. But your imagination is also on overdrive and it's difficult to know where objectivity fades into fantasy. The mists of illusion hide a slippery slope, yet you can avoid sliding off the edge of reality by consistently sticking to the absolute truth. Don't tempt fate; there isn't much wiggle room now, for your margin of error is quite small."
aries,2011-02-04,"You may be boiling mad today as the warrior planet combines forces with the radiant Sun. Aggressive Mars is your ruling planet, tuning you in to trouble before it even happens. Thankfully, you can consciously choose to use this energy for a positive cause by standing up for someone's freedom of expression or defending an idea that's particularly important to you."
taurus,2011-02-04,"You aren't usually eager to express your anger, but you can be a formidable opponent today if others push you too far. Although someone could be interfering with your work, you are able to exhibit a great deal of patience. Withholding your emotions may be your most effective strategy, but you'll only be able to keep your annoyance to yourself for so long. Nevertheless, take the high road today; hopefully, the negativity will pass on its own."
gemini,2011-02-04,"You may be more argumentative than usual today, and you don't seem to be able to use your clever wit to avoid conflict. Whatever you do now fans the flames of negativity as the friction grows. Still, the final outcome of the current situation is within your control. Summon up enough courage to walk away from an unpleasant scene. Otherwise, you'll just waste your precious time and energy in a fight that won't matter in the long run."
cancer,2011-02-04,"It may be easy for you to see what's going on in your relationships, but sharing your feelings is much harder than just observing them. Your challenge now is to express the truth exactly as you see it while knowing that you'll probably have to actively defend your beliefs. If you do decide to stand up for yourself, avoid getting stuck in the details. Concentrating on the big picture is your best strategy, but don't let your philosophical approach tempt you to forget about the facts."
leo,2011-02-04,"Making dramatic gestures may be your way of stirring up trouble today, because you aren't interested in supporting a plan that goes against your point of view. If you don't want to make a big deal of things, strenuous physical activity can help you blow off some steam. However, there's a good chance that your plans will backfire if you don't express yourself one way or another. Proceed with caution; losing your temper could alienate the very same people you want to have on your side."
virgo,2011-02-04,"You are motivated to get a lot done at work today with the Sun-Mars conjunction activating your 6th House of Employment. The cluster of planets in futuristic Aquarius encourages you to set pragmatism aside and take a risk for what you want. And although you might not be seeing everything clearly now, it's smarter to trust your intuition and do what makes sense to you rather than wasting your energy trying to persuade others to share your point of view."
libra,2011-02-04,"Although you usually excel at making everyone feel comfortable, this isn't your primary motivating force now. You are not as sweet today as warrior Mars conjuncts the willful Sun in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Even if you mean well, your actions may be charged with a combative tone that provokes others to be defensive. If you unwittingly agitate someone's ire, be smart -- apologize and retreat before your day spins wildly out of control."
scorpio,2011-02-04,You can be quite forceful today as the Sun floods your key planet Mars with its bright light. It's challenging to find a moderate path if you currently lack a healthy perspective. You might not even stop to think about what you want; you just push toward it and overcome anything that stands in your way. Act wisely when setting your goals now or you can waste a significant opportunity to get what you want.
sagittarius,2011-02-04,"Today's gung-ho Sun-Mars conjunction falls in your 3rd House of Communications, flooding your system with so much data that you are challenged to manage it all. You could easily overwhelm everyone with your grandiose thinking, yet you might have a crisis of confidence if you haven't developed a strong support system. If you're uncertain about your goals, tone down your approach until others are on the same page."
capricorn,2011-02-04,"You are usually quite proficient at managing Mars' contentious energy, yet its forceful conjunction with the Sun is in your 2nd House of Money, tempting you to spend impulsively. Fortunately, value-conscious Venus enters your sign today, reminding you that fiscal conservatism may be less fun but will produce better results in the long-run. Ironically, you'll reach satisfaction sooner if you slow down and invest your resources wisely."
aquarius,2011-02-04,"Don't worry about what others think of your actions now that the Sun-Mars conjunction is firing up your 1st House of Personality. But instead of ignoring your friends completely, explain your motives to them. Sharing your strategies for the big changes ahead -- even if they aren't as practical as others might like -- will help you clarify what you must do. It's not quite time to execute your plan; for now, just dream out loud with your friends to gain a fresh perspective."
pisces,2011-02-04,"The action-packed Sun-Mars conjunction falls in your 12th House of Imagination today, emphasizing your fantasies. But your well-intentioned dreams may be blocked by someone who doesn't share your poetic vision. Attacking those in your way only increases their power and sets you back in your journey. Ignore the negativity and find a methodical pace that you can sustain all day."
aries,2011-02-05,"It's not easy today to stay focused on the present moment because you could be so concerned about your future. However, your recollection of something from your past may be more of a problem than whatever happens next. Thankfully, this is an opportunity for you to learn how to trust in the intelligence of ""now,"" rather than obsessing about unresolved feelings left over from some vague memory."
taurus,2011-02-05,"You may become so obsessed with one particular idea now that it's hard for anyone to get you to talk about anything else. Fortunately, your current thinking can actually pull you in a positive direction, but that's not the only consideration. Voluntary downplaying the importance of your own thoughts is a wise tactic today and makes you more accessible to your friends and family."
gemini,2011-02-05,"You are being torn between your magical fantasies and the down-to-earth realities that you currently face. You're eager to release your day-to-day worries and dance the night away with friends, but you are also concerned about leaving loose ends untied. This may be an all-too-familiar scenario for you, but you should try to forget about recreational activities now until you wrap up some old business. It will be easier to enjoy yourself once you have done the responsible thing and demonstrated your dependability."
cancer,2011-02-05,"Clean up unfinished chores early in the day so you can fully enjoy the pleasure that you so richly deserve. Even if you plan a quiet evening at home, give yourself the time and space to dream about the changes that you want to experience in the near future. There aren't any intelligent reasons to hold back your creative vision today; you can travel anywhere you wish in your mind."
leo,2011-02-05,"You may have thought that you would be ready for change no matter what happens, but you grow more contemplative as the day wears on. You know that you should be thankful for certain aspects of your life, yet you also are too aware of those things that still need improvement. Nevertheless, don't focus on what's wrong; concentrate on all the little things that you could do to continue your personal growth."
virgo,2011-02-05,"You may attempt to hold back your true intentions during the day. Even if you are sure about your feelings, you might not like the idea of others knowing what you want. Keeping things to yourself could be a waste of energy now, especially since your workmates and friends probably know more than you realize. Sharing what's on your mind isn't as much of a risk as it seems."
libra,2011-02-05,"You are driven now by your own internal need to express yourself in a new and different manner. Rely on your charm and grace if you feel resistance to your efforts to do your own thing. Fortunately, you exude more common sense than you think. Focus on being true to yourself while also keeping your mind open to different perspectives. If you remain flexible in your thinking, it will be much easier to let go of control and go along with others for the sake of group harmony."
scorpio,2011-02-05,"Keep to yourself for the first part of the day, and you will more thoroughly enjoy the company of others later on. Fortunately, you won't have to hide your emotions or hold back your desires, for the Moon's entry into your playful 5th House creates the perfect environment for you to express yourself. You'll know when you're ready, so don't let anyone cajole you into reacting until the time is right."
sagittarius,2011-02-05,"If you're buzzing like a busy bee, you may be too distracted today to fully appreciate the camaraderie of your family and friends. Nevertheless, you can't say no to a potentially interesting gathering. Thankfully, once you are involved in the group, you just might forget how tired you were earlier. Allowing yourself to be vulnerable with those you trust can prove to be  the exact catalyst you need."
capricorn,2011-02-05,"Attractive Venus is still lagging behind the planetary pack while visiting your practical sign, and you are taking your physical and emotional needs quite seriously now. You are more somber than usual, for there are significant challenges ahead that you must face. Nevertheless, you're still committed to the work you have already started. Be patient as you build on your accomplishments and wait for the opportunities to reap the rewards."
aquarius,2011-02-05,"You have the impetus to start something new now, but you must be willing to change and grow in order to maximize the current opportunities. However, this process can be quite challenging if you are unwilling to let go of the past. Don't hold on to what you have or you won't be able to take advantage of the possibilities that are right in front of you."
pisces,2011-02-05,"You can gain a lot today by stopping and reevaluating your recent history. Paradoxically, this review process can also stimulate your anticipation of the future. Your life begins to take on a greater meaning as you see unstable social systems bending under the pressure of change. Meanwhile, you're committed to finding stability in the midst of transition, even if you don't yet know how you will manage it. Don't worry about the details; you'll figure things out along the way."
aries,2011-02-06,"You want to make your friends feel comfortable today while you put your needs on the back burner. However, your motivation may be more selfish than it appears, for if those around you are enjoying themselves, you know your chances of being happy are better, too. Your charm is in top form so apply your people skills to create a memorable day."
taurus,2011-02-06,"You may have an even-tempered approach toward doing your chores today, but will still be tempted to take the easy way out if it is offered to you. Your key planet Venus will seduce you into saying yes to nearly anything that sounds like fun now, even if you must temporarily set your responsibilities aside. Be aware that you cannot escape permanently; you're just delaying the inevitable."
gemini,2011-02-06,"Your creativity knows no bounds today, and yet, you can work comfortably within the circumstantial limits being placed on you. Be careful, because your ideas can be so grandiose that you end up being less than productive. It's understandable if you try to get by doing less than usual now, even if friends and family don't approve of your motives. However, if you choose to indulge yourself now, you could land in a big heap of trouble that will take some time to clean up. Be mindful of the cost of following your every whim."
cancer,2011-02-06,"You may be overly forgiving now, as your ideas about love lean toward compassionate care and supportive nurturing. However, you might be overcompensating for taking decisive control earlier when the responsibility fell in your lap. Stay vigilant; there's no need to go overboard with your permissive attitude. Strike a healthy balance between unconditional acceptance and tough love."
leo,2011-02-06,"Although your birthday is several months away, today may feel like a day when you can make a wish and have it come true. But as enjoyable as an unrealistic fantasy becomes now, you are better off focusing on the more practical aspects of your daydreams. Your imagination can reveal important clues about what's around the next bend if you take the time to pay attention."
virgo,2011-02-06,"You may change your mind at the last minute and decide to accept a social invitation now that Venus in your 5th House of Fun and Games squares joyful Jupiter. Unfortunately, this alignment might also encourage you to play when you need to be working or to splurge when you don't have any extra money to spend. Be as practical as possible today and you'll feel better about yourself at the end of the day."
libra,2011-02-06,"Lots of little things seem to be working in your favor now that serious Saturn in your sign is harmonizing with the superhero combo of Venus and Mars. Unfortunately, you would be wrong to assume that you can turn on your charm and get anything you want. However, a bit of humility will help you persuade someone into seeing things your way. When it comes to something important, an emotional appeal is not a substitute for logic and common sense."
scorpio,2011-02-06,"If your life seems too complicated to manage everyone's different emotional needs, remember that these complex social circumstances didn't appear out of thin air. Part of your current stress may stem from someone trying to thwart your progress. Even if you feel as if everything is overwhelming, you'll get more clarity by breaking down each situation into separate issues and taking care of them one at a time."
sagittarius,2011-02-06,"Although you may be very appreciative of your friends and family today, you also might be too idealistic about your relationships in general. Tread cautiously so you don't make any decisions based on your desire to live up to anyone else's expectations of you. Worrying too much about others can prove to be a waste of precious time and energy."
capricorn,2011-02-06,"Those around you may claim to be watching out for your best interests now, but this may not actually be the case. Nevertheless, it still might be an ideal time to ask for a raise because the Sun and Mars in your 2nd House of Income harmonize with karmic Saturn in your 10th House of Career. Today is a great day to make concrete plans; just remember that your expectations could be inflated, so don't ask for more than you deserve."
aquarius,2011-02-06,"Your optimism continues to grow throughout the day, but taking any idea too far could bring a swift and sobering response. You may have your share of fairly fixed concepts about how everything should run in your life, but keeping a flexible attitude about your goals can help smooth out the rough spots today. Being objective is a smart strategy, but only if you are truly willing to see things from another point of view."
pisces,2011-02-06,"You are eager to get to the bottom of a mystery that involves you and your parents, children or a very close friend. Unfortunately, someone may not be disclosing all the facts you need to know, which inadvertently motivates you to uncover what's being kept from you. However, don't push too hard prior to having real evidence. You're better off to wait a day or two to see what information surfaces on its own."
aries,2011-02-07,"You may feel wired today, as if you are ready to set the world on fire. However, you might become less confident when you see how others react to your off-the-wall energy. Keep in mind that you are probably giving off mixed signals because your moods are changing quickly and you aren't very good at hiding your emotions with the Moon in your sign. Still, it's wise to balance your sense of urgency with a bit of prudence. You have more time than you think."
taurus,2011-02-07,"It's a good idea to check in with yourself today to see what you need, especially if you've been spending a lot of time with friends and family. Ironically, going back to work may be a welcome relief, even if only to stir things up and get you moving again. Your restlessness could prompt you to start a new project, but it's more important to tie up loose ends so you can be ready for new opportunities when they come knocking at your door."
gemini,2011-02-07,"You are eager to reconnect with your friends and co-workers today, for you are quite excited about something new in your life. You could be so enthusiastic that you want to tell everyone about your plans. But remember that it's important to follow through on your previous commitments because others are counting on you. Fortunately, you have sufficient common sense now to find balance between your desire for social interactions and your sense of responsibility."
cancer,2011-02-07,"You may feel as if you're standing at a crossroads today. You can imagine what it would be like to be on the other side of the intersection and want to blast your way through any fear. But as you move forward, you can see that there are lots of different ways to proceed, so what starts as an impulse could turn into a much deeper consideration. Don't rush the process; let it unfold naturally, according to its own clock."
leo,2011-02-07,"You may be interested in exploring your emotions in a deeper way today, but might not know exactly how to do it. Actually, it's tough to be real if you're more comfortable when you're safely hiding behind a mask. Although you are often able to disguise yourself, the true you will still shine through now. Thankfully, once you realize that it isn't worth all the work that it takes to keep your intensity hidden, it will be much easier to touch others with what's really in your heart."
virgo,2011-02-07,"You may be more lighthearted now, but only if you are already caught up at work. You have a lot on your plate these days, yet your heightened state of efficiency enables you to get everything done and still have time left over for fun. However, in your quest for excitement, don't be so eager that you agree to be part of something before you know what it is. Ultimately, you'll be happiest today if you decide what you want and then stick to your plan to get it."
libra,2011-02-07,"No matter what you do, someone close to you could become annoyed or even angry with your actions (or inaction) today. However, from your point of view, he or she seems to be needlessly stirring up conflict. Unfortunately, your attempts to avoid confrontation may not be effective. Don't argue; relying on logic to defuse the situation will only make matters worse. A strategy based on compassion will be more successful now, so soften your position and try to be more understanding."
scorpio,2011-02-07,"You aren't interested in walking on eggshells now; if you have something to say, you need to just come right out and say it. In particular, your patience wears thin if you are challenged by someone who acts selfishly today. Although you know what might be best in the long run, you're still tempted to push an issue right to the edge. Be smart and step back from a confrontational encounter. It's currently wiser to reduce the pressure on a difficult situation than to add more stress to it."
sagittarius,2011-02-07,"Although you're longing to be playful today with the Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Games, it's hard to get past your own sense of lingering caution. Something tells you that you cannot set your current responsibilities aside, even if you're tempted to escape. Thankfully, you can now have your cake and eat it, too. Working hard and accomplishing a lot early in the day will justify your lighthearted spontaneity later on."
capricorn,2011-02-07,"You have a tight schedule today and would like to stick to it. You aren't in the mood to add anything to your day that's not already in the plan. Unfortunately, your desire to have everything neatly compartmentalized won't give you the certainty that you want. Much to your chagrin, responding to someone's unexpected emotional display could pull you off track. Keep in mind that their feelings are real and need to be taken seriously, even if it seems like an inconvenience to you."
aquarius,2011-02-07,"It's relatively easy to interact with others today if you are willing to let go of your personal agenda. However, if you hold onto unexpressed feelings, they could get in the way of your relationship happiness. It's smarter to just state what's on your mind and let others know if something makes you feel uncomfortable. Remember that your current issues don't need immediate resolution. A spirited discussion that gets everyone's feelings out in the open will help more than you think."
pisces,2011-02-07,"You may be thinking about new ways to increase your income, but your current thoughts might not be very connected to reality. Don't worry if your ideas seem totally impractical now; what's important is to give yourself permission to dream. Your imagination could be the key to an upcoming breakthrough, so let the fantasies roll by unedited. Wait until you return to earth in a couple of days before settling on a suitable goal and choosing a logical course of action."
aries,2011-02-08,"You could temporarily lose confidence about your shift in direction today, but you're not likely to slow down or change your mind. Once you begin moving on a project, you'll be tempted to continue pushing until you're done. Unfortunately, your strategy may not work exactly as conceived. Modify whatever needs improvement and try again."
taurus,2011-02-08,"This is a day of amazing mental and spiritual experiences within the deep recesses of your own mind as your fantasies are being stimulated by strong feelings. However, your life has even greater unrealized potential now if you just go out of your way to share your hidden aspirations with someone you trust. The simple act of putting them out into the open is sufficient to shift the dynamics and improve your current situation."
gemini,2011-02-08,"You are not able to sit still today, even if your job requires you to stay put at your desk. Your frustration could take you right to the edge if you can't figure out a way to interact with others throughout the day. Social activities can provide a healthy distraction and even inspire some positive ideas. Your friends can encourage you with their constructive advice now, so listen carefully to what they say."
cancer,2011-02-08,"Taking good care of those you love is easy work for you nurturing Crabs, so it should come naturally today when you are called upon for assistance. Helping others enables you to feel good about yourself without having to meet someone else's production standards. Even if you fall behind at work now, you can still take pride in what you do by just showing up for a friend with a willing attitude and an open heart."
leo,2011-02-08,"You are overly enthusiastic about having fun today, even if it means playing hooky from school or work. Unfortunately, you could easily get caught if you just leave your responsibilities undone. However, thinking about the consequences isn't a sufficient deterrent now. Nevertheless, there's no need to act foolishly. If you start early, you can finish enough work to enable you to take the rest of the day off without guilt."
virgo,2011-02-08,"If you are considering a joint venture, this is an ideal time to present your ideas to your potential partners. You are pumped up by the strength of your convictions, and the fiery Aries Moon gives you the ability to express yourself with gusto. But even with your current enthusiasm, you may experience fleeting moments of self-doubt. Thankfully, you can demonstrate your competence by concentrating on the details to show others that you are on the right track."
libra,2011-02-08,"You might not have enough time to fully recuperate between a series of exciting activities, as one thing after another pulls you farther into the future. Unfortunately, discouragement could overtake your enthusiasm if you allow exhaustion to set in. Don't let others talk you into taking on too much; use your common sense and pace yourself so you are not worn out by the end of the day."
scorpio,2011-02-08,"You are continuing your recent theme of trying new things to spice up your life. Today, the pioneering Aries Moon in your 6th House of Routine shakes up old habits and brings excitement to the table. Instead of doing your job the same way you did it last week, experiment and do something completely different. But tread carefully so you don't inadvertently create unnecessary turmoil in an already turbulent day."
sagittarius,2011-02-08,"Your confidence today isn't helpful if it tempts you to skip over necessary preparation and walk into an important meeting cold. Even if you are clever enough to pull off your presentation, it's too critical of a moment to deliver your ideas extemporaneously. For maximum results, do all your homework and then carefully review your work before sharing it with others."
capricorn,2011-02-08,"Those closest to you now may not realize how sensitive you are because you are able to cover your insecurities with a smokescreen of hard work. You could even try to overcompensate by taking responsibility for extra things that are beyond your sphere of influence. Ultimately, it's better to show your strength by acknowledging your limitations. Be smart and do fewer things with greater competence."
aquarius,2011-02-08,"Your energy could be a bit scattered now, so it's a smart idea to take a few deep breaths and slow down. The rapid-response Aries Moon is now in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, amplifying the hectic pace of your life. Your plans may run pretty smoothly at first, but something will unravel your tightly-woven schedule. Establishing firm priorities early in the day can help to keep you on track."
pisces,2011-02-08,"You want to explore using new tactics today in your ongoing attempt to get a handle on your personal finances. Maybe your old method of paying bills isn't working as well as it once did. Or, perhaps you are considering an original approach to saving for the future. Luckily, your innovative thinking can be quite realistic now, so conjure up a viable solution to a problem and then don't be afraid to try it out."
aries,2011-02-09,"You aren't going to take no for an answer today, no matter what your question is. You are driven by your idea of success and will do whatever is necessary to get to the top of the mountain. Anyone who stands in your way is fair game to receive the brunt of your annoyance or anger, but it's not a smart idea to ride roughshod over someone who would be better as an ally than as an adversary. Don't act foolishly; it's wiser to be inclusive than exclusive."
taurus,2011-02-09,"The Moon's return to your sign today makes you more aware of your feelings. There's nothing wrong with being in touch with your physical needs, but the Moon's harmonious alignment with your key planet Venus and intense Pluto can bring very strong desires to the surface. Fortunately, your judgment is on point now, as long as you take other people's perspectives into consideration. But even if you're sure that you're correct, it's not a good day to be overly stubborn."
gemini,2011-02-09,"Your fantasies may be running rampant today and it might be tempting to draw an intimate partner closer by sharing your thoughts. Unfortunately, it won't be that easy to bring your secrets out into the open now. Ultimately, your inability to tell all could turn out in your favor, for there are some things that are best left unsaid."
cancer,2011-02-09,"You are usually quite sensitive to other people's feelings, but today you may need to retreat because someone is just too intense for you to handle. However, attempts on your part to establish reasonable boundaries could just further inflame the drama. Remember, you can be caring and supportive without taking responsibility for a difficult situation that isn't yours. Remain sympathetic while also maintaining whatever distance you require for your own emotional health."
leo,2011-02-09,"You have a low tolerance today for anyone who isn't willing to stand up for what he or she believes. Normally, you would be more concerned with making sure that your ideas were getting all the attention they deserve, but now you can be content with just quietly respecting others' opinions as long as they are being true to themselves. You're not interested in arguing with someone who is looking for a fight; you would rather explore how your own passions can enrich your life, instead."
virgo,2011-02-09,"You might become obsessed today with expressing yourself in a manner that is surprising to others. Initially, it may seem as if you're able to maintain a cool and emotionally detached attitude, but it soon becomes apparent that you are hooked on a feeling and are unwilling to let it go. Don't be afraid of your intensity now; just be certain that your ideas are worth the extra effort."
libra,2011-02-09,"You are sometimes criticized for not being able to make up your mind, but today you'll probably fall at the other end of the spectrum. You are quick to state what you want and are unwavering in your approach to get it. In fact, you might be so firm in your convictions now that you're ready to confront anyone who gets in your way. Your current commitment to passionate living is admirable as long as you don't take yourself so seriously that you start a needless fight over something that's just not that important."
scorpio,2011-02-09,"Loving Venus joins your key planet Pluto today, accentuating your deep feelings and bringing hidden desires to the surface. You aren't interested in simply experiencing the power of emotions; you want to communicate your fears and discuss your attractions, even if they make someone uncomfortable. Don't back away from your convictions; it's not your job now to manage how anyone else might react to your truth."
sagittarius,2011-02-09,It's crucial for you to find a steady pace at work because your consistent efforts could bring you increased income with the Venus-Pluto conjunction activating your 2nd House of Money. Making a cash investment could be a smart move now if your involvement also gives you an active role. But don't expect something for nothing; today you'll need to put in the labor before reaping the rewards.
capricorn,2011-02-09,"You are determined to express yourself today, but others may not be able to see past your fierce approach to life. Emotional pressures have been building beneath the surface and now might be pushed to an eruption point. Even if your extreme reactions feel out of control, you can moderate your outward response by concentrating on your long-term goals rather than the chaos of the present moment."
aquarius,2011-02-09,"You could expend a lot of energy today managing your intense emotional reaction if someone tries to control you. Fortunately, you're strong enough now to resist a powerful person who fears your success. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to draw battle lines and take on an adversary. It's much smarter to win the fight against your own insecurities. If you don't have a need to demonstrate your superiority, then the stress will dissipate without a showdown."
pisces,2011-02-09,"The relationship dynamics with your co-workers can turn into a power struggle if you think they are excluding you from the team. You don't want to be an outsider now, but you're not interested in sacrificing your values for the sake of being accepted by the group. Although communication is difficult when emotions are running so high, it's still worth the effort to start a meaningful dialogue and establish common ground where everyone can feel comfortable enough to work together."
aries,2011-02-10,"Your current inflexibility can create problems today, especially if you get into a disagreement about something that's important to you. You are confident about your point of view, yet it might feel as if others are conspiring against you by building a case to change your mind. Avoid escalating an argument into open conflict; however, you don't have to be shy about clearly informing everyone exactly where you stand."
taurus,2011-02-10,"The Moon is back for another two-day visit to your sign, reassuring you that your emotions make sense and that no one else can tell you how to react. Although you may reserve the right to change your opinion, don't expect your friends to be able to keep up with your mood swings. Someone else's actions won't likely shift your position, but it's always wise to keep an open mind, just in case."
gemini,2011-02-10,"You may not be overly expressive today as the Moon squares mental Mercury and energetic Mars. If you do share your emotions, your words could easily be perceived as more aggressive than you intend. It's smarter to wait until tomorrow when the Moon enters your sign before telling everyone what you think. Avoiding a tricky conversation is much easier if you simply don't go there in the first place."
cancer,2011-02-10,"You will feel more stable today if you're involved in a community project or part of a team at work. However, you're not able to assume the identity that's necessary for you to fully merge with the rest of the group. Your resistance to assimilation encourages unorthodox behavior, but don't be afraid of stepping into the circle -- even if you believe you would be more comfortable standing out on the edge."
leo,2011-02-10,"The Moon in your 10th House of Public Responsibility indicates that you are being asked to pitch in and help someone out now, even if you're weary of putting your needs second. But your generosity of spirit prevails because ultimately you want to assist others in reaching their potential. Nevertheless, the Sun's tense connection to relentless Pluto enables you to make a plan and then stick with it as if your life depends on it. Focusing on the details should allow things to flow more easily throughout the day."
virgo,2011-02-10,"You are in an efficient mode of operation today, so don't be afraid to push hard to accomplish as much as possible. However, you still need to pay attention to the boundaries of your co-workers or you might inadvertently offend someone you thought was your ally. Don't set your goals so high that you end up frustrated. Rely on tried and true methodologies to get ahead now, rather than counting solely on your inspiration."
libra,2011-02-10,"You may feel a bit annoyed today as the sensible Taurus Moon visits your sexy 8th House of Deep Sharing. You prefer to keep things light and easy, but you could get pulled into intense discussions about your feelings. If romantic energy is present now, follow it without becoming overly attached to the outcome. Don't attempt to deceive anyone into acting on something they aren't feeling or your trickery will quickly backfire."
scorpio,2011-02-10,"You could have a confrontation with a friend or a lover today, turning him or her into an opponent rather than a supporter. But it's not wise to acquiesce too quickly, for some things shouldn't be negotiable. Your current nemesis could appear to be very determined, but will likely give in under your persistent pressure. Patience is your best strategy now, so don't be in a hurry to reach a resolution."
sagittarius,2011-02-10,"Your busy day may not be as inspiring as you wish, but you have important things to do at work nonetheless, and they can bring you the extra motivation you need today. You want to finish everything you started because you don't want the heaviness of unfulfilled promises weighing on your mind. Although it goes against your nature, you would be wise now to let go of the big picture and concentrate on the details one item at a time."
capricorn,2011-02-10,"The earthy Taurus Moon assists you in a practical way today when she visits your 5th House of Creativity. You have a magic touch now, and can use it to your advantage by giving yourself permission to have fun, even while you're working. Don't let financial considerations stand in your way; stressful money issues should only take a few days to settle down."
aquarius,2011-02-10,"You have been riding on an energetic high recently as action-hero Mars continues to escort the Sun through your sign. But today, your needs don't jive with where you are currently heading. The more you attempt to get back to basics, the more complicated everything becomes. Rather than relying on logic to figure out what to do, trust your instincts now. They will steer you in the right direction in your search for answers."
pisces,2011-02-10,"You could become single-minded now in your quest to accomplish your goals because you want to justify taking time off later. But you have already overloaded your calendar with so much to do that it will be a miracle if you can meet your own expectations. Although you may be highly motivated, it's wise not to stress. Instead of attempting to do everything today, give yourself more time to complete your tasks."
aries,2011-02-11,"Life gets a bit strange today because you know something is cooking beyond what you can perceive. You feel waves of positive energy arriving in the form of interesting people, but could be disappointed because you're too distracted to make a real heart connection. It's great that there's so much happening, but don't let your excitement stand in the way of having a deeper interaction."
taurus,2011-02-11,"Although you could have a flurry of interesting ideas today, don't try to follow up on all of them. Instead, pick only the best one and then work to make it real. If you don't consciously limit your scope of vision, you'll end up wasting your efforts by scattering them. Instead of jumping from one thought to the next, keep coming back to build on the foundation you have already started."
gemini,2011-02-11,"The Moon's return to your sign helps to clear the muddy waters of your desires. Your sense of what you want is growing sharper. However, your current hypersensitivity can make you more aware of your emotional reaction to stress. Observe your changing moods today without becoming attached to any one emotion. This exercise in objectivity will enable you to maintain a healthy perspective so you don't make promises that you cannot keep."
cancer,2011-02-11,"You are quite contemplative today and there isn't much you need to do about it other than to discuss your ideas with trusted friends. You might realize how important it is to overcome a blockage that has been created by your fear of change. Fortunately, once you start to share your story, others will be able to join in and participate in your experience. The valuable feedback you receive now can inspire and comfort you on your journey of self-discovery."
leo,2011-02-11,"You are very tempted to tell a fundamental piece of your personal story today in a way that is different from your regular approach. You are less guarded now and would benefit by keeping your vulnerable spots accessible to make room for someone special to connect with you. Move beyond any false pride that you may still be holding on to, and behave in a way that is true to yourself. Your complete authenticity will be reflected back to you in a way that can open up your heart even more."
virgo,2011-02-11,"Your boss may rely on you to come up with a solution that requires some extra work over the weekend. This dilemma makes it difficult for you to take care of your own needs, for your professional responsibilities may have to come first for another day or two. Don't fret over what you cannot do. Instead of worrying about your performance, just do your best; that's all that anyone can ask from you."
libra,2011-02-11,"The Moon's entry into versatile Gemini this evening can reveal countless intriguing options that you want to explore. Unfortunately, you cannot go down multiple paths at the same time. Think through each possible scenario and then pick the one that is most resonant to your thoughts and feelings. But don't let your choice slip back into the recesses of your mind; do something about it while the idea is still hot."
scorpio,2011-02-11,"It's a bit frustrating if your day seems to spin out of control. Unfortunately, your interactions with others have lives of their own today and all you can do is observe your emotions as they ebb and flow. Your current situation is in flux, so don't be so hard on yourself if you cannot decide what to do. Let the strange currents carry you along for a ride; you might even like where they take you."
sagittarius,2011-02-11,"Your friends may change their minds at the last minute today which can upset your plans. Don't waste your energy trying to make them conform to your schedule. Ultimately, you like their unusual behavior -- perhaps it even amuses you -- so there's no need to try to rein them in. Your secret weapon now is practicing universal acceptance. Allowing for every person's uniqueness reduces the tension in your life and sets the stage for further cooperation."
capricorn,2011-02-11,"It may be challenging to finish your chores because you are more scattered than usual today. The Moon's shift into breezy Gemini and your 6th House of Details messes with your practical approach to your daily routine. But it's not just about being distracted. If you let go of control, you can learn many different things from a variety of sources now. Remaining open to what happens is the best way to create your future."
aquarius,2011-02-11,"You want to have fun this weekend while the flirty Gemini Moon is lighting up your 5th House of Pleasure. Thankfully, enjoying yourself now may be easier than you think. The main problem is that planning your activities could be quite complicated. Instead of focusing on the details of your schedule, just leave things open. Moving through the day with a light touch will allow the complexity to pass."
pisces,2011-02-11,"You may be looking forward to spending more time at home with your family. But another part of you wants to escape into Fantasyland and leave the intense emotional interactions for another time. Unfortunately, with several planets clustered in your 12th House of Imagination, it's difficult to separate fact from fancy now, making your choices more difficult. Fortunately, you don't have to pick one path over the other; just remain flexible and respond to what happens without trying to run the show."
aries,2011-02-12,"You bounce from one thought to the next today, making it difficult to complete anything that you start. Every idea that pops into awareness warrants your serious attention until the next one pulls you in a different direction. Although you may not be able to eliminate the current distractions, you can influence how you respond. Thankfully, if you stay aware of your tendency to wander, you can keep bringing yourself back to your center."
taurus,2011-02-12,"If someone expects you to do something that doesn't make sense to you today, it will be challenging to respond favorably. You often have deep energy reserves to draw upon when you are determined to get a job done. But now you tire easily, especially if you think that you're wasting time. Don't hide your real feelings; bringing your uncertainty out into the open may be tough at first, but will ultimately make everyone feel better."
gemini,2011-02-12,"Your dual nature is apparent now, as your personality shifts throughout the day. Although you might be comfortable with your ongoing mood swings today, others could have a tougher time understanding why you are hot one moment and cold the next. You should be able to quell their concerns by simply telling them that your feelings will probably settle down in the next few days. An honest disclosure may be all that is necessary to clear the air."
cancer,2011-02-12,"Following a strict schedule could seem like a smart way to keep yourself on track now, however, it may also have the exact opposite effect. If one appointment runs late, then a cascading effect might cause the rest of your day to tumble out of control. Paradoxically, a little less worry and a lot more flexibility this weekend could put a positive spin on it all."
leo,2011-02-12,"Your closest friends may be simultaneously a source of enthusiastic encouragement and stone cold resistance, forcing you to decide which extreme of the spectrum to emphasize. But you may be experiencing a dilemma, as you shift between feeling quite assertive one moment and then rather cautious the next. When you accept these forces as merely two aspects of your complex personality, you will be more open to seeing how these contrary aspects of yourself can peacefully coexist."
virgo,2011-02-12,"A personal relationship may be stressed today, leading you to accomplish less than you wish while adding another serving of anxiety onto your plate. Although you must respond to the feelings of others, they don't need to become the center of your day. Do whatever intuitively feels right for you and then move on. Let everyone else  manage their own reactions for now."
libra,2011-02-12,"You could have a classic Libra moment today as you hang in the balance and are unable to make up your mind about your long-term goals. Should you sign up for a new course of study or take an overdue trip? Paradoxically, what you specifically choose now may prove to be less significant than actually just initiating action at this time. Although you must work within your current limitations, your life is on the launch pad and ready to blast off."
scorpio,2011-02-12,"Moving forward with your routine chores may be a smart idea today, but don't allow yourself to become overly focused on your work. A very narrow band of concentration could distract you from a chance to share an amazing experience with a loved one. Remember that practicing flexibility can allow the space for something wonderful to happen."
sagittarius,2011-02-12,"You have so much to learn from your friends and partners today. This can be a great day to start your education when the Moon harmoniously trines your ruling planet Jupiter in your 3rd House of Information. But you may have a tough time listening to what other people want now, because their needs can thwart your desire to develop your knowledge base. Don't let your frustration stand in the way of your success. Slowing down to accommodate others enables you to overcome obstacles so you can then move on to what's next."
capricorn,2011-02-12,Don't fall into the trap of letting the whimsical Gemini Moon pull your feelings all over the map today. It's important to be highly selective about your social causes now because getting involved with too many groups -- even if they are amazing people -- can drain your energy. What's crucial is that you are sincerely committed to sticking with your current course of action until you create the impact you want.
aquarius,2011-02-12,"Your playful energies are running strong now, encouraging you to set serious responsibilities aside for a while. This enables you to enjoy yourself, but may not be such a wonderful thing if you are up to your neck in chores and errands. Still, you must seek spontaneous avenues of expression no matter how much your current obligations constrain you. Ultimately, new ways of doing things today can replace old counterproductive habits."
pisces,2011-02-12,"You can't escape today as your head and heart tug in different directions. The current tension is created by the clever Gemini Moon that reminds you to logically think your way through any problem. However, you Fish like to rely on your gut feelings to navigate your way to success because you know that sometimes facts can hide the truth. Keep in mind that your answer won't be found in the rational or the emotional side of the debate. Instead, just jump directly into the fray without any extra thought and let intuition be your guide."
aries,2011-02-13,You are prone to say things now before you consider the consequences of your words. This impulsiveness can create problems because you don't seem willing to even try to control the flow of your thoughts. It can be tricky to distinguish between a sensible idea and one that's off the wall. Take time for contemplation before opening your mouth; otherwise you might wish that you remained silent.
taurus,2011-02-13,"A busy weekend is quickly coming to an end and you may feel challenged to keep up with all that's happening. Nevertheless, you're wise to just grit your teeth and do what's expected of you now without stirring up too much trouble. If you don't waste energy resisting, you could actually accomplish a lot. Think about what you want to achieve in the days ahead and make a sensible plan to get what you want."
gemini,2011-02-13,"You may feel like a soaring eagle today, eager to catch the wind. Luckily, the right breeze can take you as far and wide as you'll let it. However, this isn't a free ride because you have to pay careful attention to anything that would upset the delicate balance. You have plenty to say, but the current circumstances require you to be smart about how you deliver your message. Don't try to exert control over everything that's happening or you could lose your momentum."
cancer,2011-02-13,"Your friends might not understand how fast your inner wheels are turning today, but you're expending a lot of mental energy just to keep up with what's happening. It's hard work to make it look like you have things under control now. You are tempted to escape into your dreams and coast a bit, but it's crucial to remain focused on the events of the present moment, even if your thoughts try to take you somewhere else."
leo,2011-02-13,"Your actions usually carry your message quite effectively, but today it's probably wiser to tell someone what you feel instead of trying to demonstrate it. You should be careful because your confidence allows you to overlook an important piece of information. It may be tough to regain lost ground if you say something that shows your lack of understanding, so proceed with caution and cover all your bases."
virgo,2011-02-13,"You may be trying to get important information from your radio today, but several stations are coming in simultaneously. You must find a way to filter out some of the noise, but it's difficult when you cannot tell which signal is the one you need to hear. Even if you prefer using analysis as your primary tool of deduction, it's smarter now to temporarily turn off the incoming data stream and just trust your intuition."
libra,2011-02-13,"You might feel as if someone is barking orders at you now, but you don't want to blindly follow them. Take your time before responding, for it doesn't make sense to react before you fully understand what's happening. Although it seems as if everything is out in the open, you still think there is something more to learn. Don't allow anyone to coerce you into agreement until you reach your own independent conclusion."
scorpio,2011-02-13,"You are able to say exactly what you mean today, yet you still can get yourself into trouble. You may be so determined to make someone see your point of view that you don't know when to stop trying. It's difficult to just walk away from a discussion until you have covered the same ground one too many times. Needless to say, this overpowering intensity can alienate a close friend in the process. End a conversation with the other person wanting more, not less."
sagittarius,2011-02-13,"Although you seek meaning in your interactions with others, today you might be left with a lot of unsatisfying encounters. Don't let others ramble on aimlessly; use your persuasive charm to bring them back into focus so they can finish making their points. However, you must be careful not to complete anyone else's thoughts. Don't assume you know what they're trying to say. Instead, listen between the words and encourage your friends to express what's in their hearts."
capricorn,2011-02-13,"It's difficult to stay anchored to reality today because your thoughts are wandering around in the clouds. You may grow a bit anxious because you're uncomfortable with your current lack of practicality. Unfortunately, you may not have the concentration that's necessary to rein in your unconventional ideas now. Keeping both feet on the ground could cause you to lose the magic of a greater vision. Dream today; make it real tomorrow."
aquarius,2011-02-13,It may be challenging to bring your thoughts down to earth today. You could notice unusual occurrences and synchronistic events that demonstrate the flimsiness of the boundaries between this world and others. But don't go betting your future on something that's happening in a parallel universe. It's okay to watch the magic unfold as long as you don't lose track of what's important here and now.
pisces,2011-02-13,"It's like you are walking on a high wire today and can make a dangerous act seem perfectly safe to others. Your apparent courage might actually be linked to denial, but focusing on positive thoughts is a smart idea, nonetheless. Still, a little caution is advised, for unfettered imagination can also breed uncertainty now. Do your best to keep your thinking anchored to the mundane physical world, even while performing your own special kind of magic."
aries,2011-02-14,"You may try a more cautious approach to love today, but you could be stressing over the wrong things. Instead of spending time calculating what your most strategic move might be to get what you want, let circumstances develop at their own rate. Your impatience can interfere with whatever stability you have already gained. Even if you feel stuck, don't worry about forcing progress now. Things will make more sense soon enough."
taurus,2011-02-14,"You have specific ideas about how the day should unfold, but you won't likely be able to stick to your plan today. It's difficult to manage your schedule when other people are changing their minds about activities that involve you. But you cannot just retreat, because you may need to be the shoulder that someone leans on. It's pointless now to push your agenda; instead, relax a bit and learn what you can by going along with the flow."
gemini,2011-02-14,"You don't feel like talking about yourself today, even if you know exactly what you need. You believe that you are wise to keep your feelings quiet now, for you're afraid of being judged by your peers. It's true that others may not understand your current motives, so stay on guard. You can avoid questions you really don't want to answer if you don't give too much away in the first place. Focusing on other people's needs conveniently takes the spotlight off of you."
cancer,2011-02-14,"Although you may want to be spontaneous now, it can be intimidating if you are worried about being criticized for your actions. You could feel emotionally raw, as if others already know what you desire, even though you didn't tell them anything. However, your fear of being vulnerable can get in your way because it has you monitoring everything you say and do. One way to reduce your stress is to practice unconditional self-acceptance."
leo,2011-02-14,"Your imagination is running strong today with the Moon's visit to your 12th House of Fantasy; you have feelings that are hidden from others and you probably want to keep it that way. You just need to take a break from being on center stage. But you're not without drama because you also want to have a serious conversation with someone you love. Nevertheless, use this time to recharge your emotional batteries so you can handle the delicate relationship issues that arise in the days ahead."
virgo,2011-02-14,"You may be wary about expressing what you want today, but too much caution could mean that you miss an important opportunity. You might choose to back away from a relationship or turn down a job offer if it doesn't match up to your high expectations, but it's not wise to retreat too quickly. However, something that is worthwhile will likely stand up to the test of time, so wait a few days before making any serious decisions."
libra,2011-02-14,"Usually you try to balance your own needs with those of your partner, for maintaining peace and harmony is important to you. However, you are more likely to keep your wishes to yourself now because you don't want to upset the status quo. You may have an idealized relationship destination in mind, yet you don't want to say anything because you aren't exactly sure of how you're going to get there. Don't worry about the details; just be clear about your desires with the understanding that satisfaction could still take a while longer to reach."
scorpio,2011-02-14,"You have been thinking about practical matters of the heart recently, and even if you're still looking to the future, today is a good time to review your past in order to better understand your current feelings. You may be hesitant about upcoming plans and your caution could motivate you to reassess your options. However, don't assume the worst, or that may be what you get. Instead, rest assured that your lost optimism will soon return to alleviate your more serious demeanor."
sagittarius,2011-02-14,"You may not feel as effervescent as you want, but there's no need to fake confidence if you're not currently feeling it. It may be better in the long run to show more restraint now instead of taking something too far. Spontaneity comes naturally for you, but today you will benefit by being emotionally reserved. Remember, you don't need to tell everyone everything all the time, so leave some details to the imagination."
capricorn,2011-02-14,"You may not want to deal with an emotionally needy person today, yet your patience with someone else's feelings can open doors to a new level in intimacy. It's worth the struggle as you try to determine how much you should reveal now. Naturally, it's safer to stoically hide behind a wall and say little about your desires, but that could create unnecessary resistance to deepening a relationship. Lean into any fear of intimacy by being radically honest; you might be surprised by what happens next."
aquarius,2011-02-14,"You may be so goal-oriented today that others don't quite know how to react to your intensity. Your emotions are very strong now, even if you don't want to dwell on them. But any attempt to hide your feelings will just cause you to express them in an unclear manner as someone interprets your detachment as a sign of disinterest. Go out of your way to let others know how passionately you feel about your future."
pisces,2011-02-14,"You may worry that you've taken a relationship too far and now want to retreat to a place of safety. Or, perhaps, you have made an assumption about someone that's not accurate. Fortunately, you are committed to getting the facts right today, even if it's complicated. Step back from any social pressures you might be feeling and give yourself enough distance to regain a healthier perspective."
aries,2011-02-15,"Your frustration may erupt today, creating additional problems. However, you could discover that the obstacles you face now are not about what's in your environment. Instead, you have put limits on yourself that stem from an old fear or a memory that suddenly resurfaces. But don't push too hard; even if you're able to let go of the past, it will still take a while for you to figure out what to do in the present."
taurus,2011-02-15,"It's not easy to say what you mean today because your thoughts are wandering around the cosmos as your fantasies grow out of control. Even if you try to get a very simple idea across to someone at work now, it becomes apparent that the process is not as straightforward as you think. Don't panic; just soar on the mental thermals like an eagle and then share your stories about your journey once you return."
gemini,2011-02-15,"You are tempted to conjure up new ideas with clever Mercury in futuristic Aquarius, but the reflective Cancer Moon gives you the wisdom to reconsider a recent thought before taking it to the next level. Don't worry if you get lost in your own mental maze now, for your perceptions are fuzzy with expansive Jupiter and nebulous Neptune making it impossible to be realistic. The good news is your dreams are closer than they seem. Paradoxically, you can reach your destination faster if you slow down and take your time."
cancer,2011-02-15,"The Moon's visit to your sign encourages you to do something by yourself today or, at least, seriously consider a personal holiday. But even if you retreat socially, it's not very likely that you will become reclusive. You are too enamored with others now to fully appreciate your solitude. Even if you are unclear about how much social activity to include in your life, leave room for those whose company you enjoy the most."
leo,2011-02-15,"The Sun's creative quintile with shadowy Pluto today can turn your dark and dreary thoughts into rainbows of possibilities. But you'll need to consciously decide that you want to walk in the light, rather than hiding in the recesses of your own dream world. Crossing over to the sunny side of the street now can help transform your deepest fears into healing love."
virgo,2011-02-15,"You may have to give up trying to get clarity today, for mental Mercury's alignment with opinionated Jupiter places a layer of subjectivity over your logical thinking. It's hard to focus as Venus aspects dreamy Neptune, making critical analysis out of the question. Contrary to what you might think, you don't have to struggle. Let your intuition guide you now, even if you don't have all the facts yet to back it up."
libra,2011-02-15,"What you say today isn't as important as what you think. It's the thoughts you keep to yourself that determine the course of the day as your domestic and job-related interactions are complicated by unspoken feelings. Ultimately, it would be much easier if everyone was emotionally transparent. Nevertheless, keeping secrets now will surely add to the tension. Even if you believe that there are no solutions to your current dilemma, your satisfaction is likely being delayed and not denied."
scorpio,2011-02-15,"You could be simmering in your own emotional juices today, without an easy way to communicate what you're feeling. Fortunately, you're not isolated from others; it's just that language doesn't seem able to convey the necessary nuance. You might be better off playing a song to express your state of mind, rather than attempting to explain yourself in awkward detail. Give your inner poet a chance to speak with diaphanous descriptions as you clear the air of any lingering tension."
sagittarius,2011-02-15,"You may wish you could escape from the hectic pace of the day. Luckily, there's magic in the air, enabling you to cast a spell that suspends belief just long enough for you to slip into an alternate reality for a little while. As long as you keep up external appearances, no one will miss you while your mind is traveling to faraway places."
capricorn,2011-02-15,"You aren't happy when you feel your tight grip on reality slipping away from you today. Nevertheless, it may be tricky to maintain control in the outer world while letting go on the mental plane. It might not be comfortable, but you need to learn that you cannot always run the show. Overcoming your fear of failure will help you to let others share in your current success."
aquarius,2011-02-15,"You may be disoriented by your deepening emotions today, but there's not much you can do to avoid them. Rather than falling down the rabbit hole with no forethought, you can harness your passions by engaging them, instead of denying them. Thankfully, you still have sufficient brainpower to do whatever you choose. Just don't forget to listen to your heart."
pisces,2011-02-15,"Your key planets, boundless Jupiter and imaginative Neptune, are activated today, making it nearly impossible to write an instruction manual, scientific paper or even a simple email. However, it's quite easy to create a work of art, sing a song or write a poem. Don't attempt to force yourself into the role of an analytical scientist or ambitious businessperson. Relying on rational thinking could be a sensible strategy for another time, but now just give yourself permission to dream."
aries,2011-02-16,"You think you're ready for almost anything today, but still may have doubts after you say yes to an intriguing offer. Perhaps your uncertainty stems from your awareness of the consequences of your actions. Or maybe you have been reminded of a past situation when your quick reaction created more trouble than it was worth. Even just a little bit of self-restraint now could be enough to help your day run more smoothly."
taurus,2011-02-16,"You may need to pay attention to a tricky domestic situation, now that the Moon is visiting your 4th House of Home and Family. Perhaps you have so much happening at work that you aren't spending enough quality time with your loved ones. Express your feelings to those who are special to you or they may begin to think that they don't matter that much to you anymore. A little bit of appreciation goes a long way."
gemini,2011-02-16,"You may have totally unrealistic expectations about your schedule, yet still think that you can make time for your own pleasure today. But it's easy to set yourself up for failure by wanting too much. Big ideas need to be pared back over the days ahead or you will hit a wall of resistance. It's better to constrain yourself voluntarily than waiting for unpleasant circumstances to suddenly stop you in your tracks."
cancer,2011-02-16,"It's usually easier to show your love with tender care than with grandiose gestures. But today you might do things differently and try to snag someone's attention by overplaying a drama. Later, you may feel embarrassed, wishing you hadn't made a scene. Although there's no need to overstate your feelings now, you don't have to apologize if you do. Just being yourself is all that is required."
leo,2011-02-16,"Avoid the temptation to express yourself in a melodramatic way today, for you could overwhelm someone you love if you say too much. Although things feel urgent now, you would be wise to tone down your intensity. Fortunately, the drama will begin to subside after the Leo Full Moon on Friday, and you may end up wishing you had kept some of your secrets to yourself. Remember, you are not obliged to share all of your fantasies."
virgo,2011-02-16,"You might have an ""aha!"" moment today about breaking free from an old pattern in your life. The problem is that logical analysis isn't a substitute for action. Although you may know what to do now, you're still limited by how you see yourself in relation to others. Be outrageous and imagine possibilities you haven't yet considered. Believing in magic can make amazing things happen."
libra,2011-02-16,"Demonstrating how to have a memorable time is your gift to your friends today. Step into your leadership role and lead by example. This is the smartest way to give others an idea of what they can do. If you practice self-restraint, then that's what you'll pass along to everyone else, diluting the shared experience. Seize the moment and your co-workers will happily follow along."
scorpio,2011-02-16,"Your need for solitude is very intense now, but you cannot justify a retreat until you first fulfill your obligations. Of course you may feel responsible to honor the promises you made to help others, instead of just taking care of yourself. Fortunately, there's time to be involved first and then spend time alone later. Don't hold back; you can have it both ways today."
sagittarius,2011-02-16,"Although you acknowledge that rules are necessary to maintain order, it's still easy for you to dream about possibilities far beyond the accepted norm. You may not feel restrained by the same laws that govern your peers. You are so enthused by the potential of the moment that you don't even think about what's right and what's wrong. Luckily, taking a calculated risk is a good idea now; you can always philosophize about it after the fact."
capricorn,2011-02-16,"You are eager to show others how intuitive you are now and might go out of your way just to let them see you in action. Sharing your inner process with those closest to you can be exhilarating, but the interpersonal dynamics will become complicated if you are insecure about your current approach. It's not time to worry about anyone's reaction to your quirky behavior. Just trust your hunches today; they won't steer you wrong."
aquarius,2011-02-16,"You don't have a lot of patience for those who want your attention so badly today that they put on a performance to get it. You can't understand why anyone would vie for recognition since you are usually so good at accepting that you're not the only person in the game. It's challenging for you to ignore someone's selfish behavior. Nevertheless, you are better off indulging others now for the sake of group harmony."
pisces,2011-02-16,"There's a lot on your plate today, but others might not be aware of your strong commitment to get things done. Naturally, there's nothing wrong with working extra hard, but don't let your need for recognition be your only motivation. Still, receiving acknowledgment is very helpful as long as you don't quit before your tasks are completely finished. Satisfaction from a job well done can be surprisingly sweet."
aries,2011-02-17,"You are in a playful mood today, and even something that's hard work can seem like a game. Although you may be gleeful that you are in touch with your inner child, make sure you aren't just being foolish. It's easy to miss something important that could prompt you to take things more seriously. With so many planets now in your 11th House of Future, be certain about where you are going before you blindly head off in a new direction."
taurus,2011-02-17,"You could be so sure of yourself that your overconfidence can backfire today. Even if you have been certain about your chosen path at work, don't assume that it's the only way to get what you want. In fact, be prepared to reconsider your long-term goals. The Sun's current conjunction with spiritual Neptune in your 10th House of Career may have you worrying less about your productivity and searching for more meaning, instead."
gemini,2011-02-17,"You can be a master of disguise today with elusive Neptune joining the Sun in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Whatever you want to be is within the range of possibility -- or, at least, so you think. You don't even need to dress up in a costume or don a mask; others will see you as you see yourself. You may appear much busier than you actually are now if it enables you to avoid taking on more work. Rather than creating a smokescreen of illusion, setting clear boundaries is your best move."
cancer,2011-02-17,"You may be tempted to hide your concern as you become increasingly uncertain of your current financial position. However, it's not a good idea to spend money on others in order to prove that you are operating on a solid fiscal foundation. Overly dramatic gestures will fall short of your desired expectations and leave you worse off than you were. Instead, hold steady for now and let others form whatever opinions they want."
leo,2011-02-17,"The Moon's current visit to your sign could amplify a difference of opinion between you and a co-worker or partner. At first you both seem to be on the same page, but the tension increases because of a simple misunderstanding. Don't focus on the disagreements or attempt to get to the bottom of an argument now. Instead, get over this emotional speed bump by concentrating your efforts on finding common ground. Wait until after tomorrow's dramatic Full Moon before trying to clarify everything else."
virgo,2011-02-17,"Tensions have been building and something has to give. Even if you are resisting the change, now you are becoming increasingly ready for an energetic shift. You cannot push this transition; it still will take a while to play on through. But at least you know where the problems are and have an idea on how to go about resolving them. For now, it's best to work through all the scenarios in your imagination without committing to one specific path, until you see how the circumstances unfold."
libra,2011-02-17,"Even if someone seems to be pretty straightforward today, there's still more going on than meets the eye. Be careful about using logic to reach a conclusion because confusing Neptune aligns with the Sun in your 5th House of Creative Expression. You might assume that you are working with facts, but your imagination is more active than you realize. Consider everything you say now as a possibility instead of the truth."
scorpio,2011-02-17,"Usually you are satisfied when you know that you did a good job, but today the Moon in your 10th House of Status reveals your desire to be recognized for your contribution. It isn't that you are insecure about your work; it's more about getting what you deserve, so don't shy away from the appreciation when it comes your way now. Even if being in the spotlight makes you slightly uncomfortable, graciously accept the acknowledgment that is offered."
sagittarius,2011-02-17,"This is a great time to enroll in a new course of study now that the Moon is traveling through your 9th House of Higher Education. This can also encourage you to read a book about a philosophy, a political perspective or a religion that is beyond your normal scope. Thankfully, you are able to integrate new ideas into your current thinking without feeling as if your intellectual foundations are being threatened. Remain open to changing your mind as your old boundaries dissolve. Expanding your horizons is a healthy expression of your confidence."
capricorn,2011-02-17,"You might grow more anxious today as you watch your stability begin to slowly crumble. The Sun's conjunction with nebulous Neptune can be great for daydreaming, yet it also makes you feel as if you're not in complete control of your own mind. Instead of trying to snap back to reality, give yourself permission to relax and imagine what you would do if nothing held you back."
aquarius,2011-02-17,"You must pay careful attention to what you do today because you can move so fast that you've done something before you even thought about the consequences. Unfortunately, clearing up even a simple misunderstanding will take precious time and energy, so it's much smarter to stop and think so you can get it right the first time around."
pisces,2011-02-17,"You have a point to make today, yet you might have a tough time being honest about what you want. The Sun-Neptune conjunction activates your 12th House of Hidden Agendas, so you aren't likely to come right out and say what you're thinking. Unfortunately, your actions could be more misleading than you intend, leaving you with the prospect of having to go back and untangle a relationship mess. If you cannot tell the whole truth now, it's better to say nothing at all."
aries,2011-02-18,"Today's fantasy-prone Full Moon falls in your 5th House of Romance and could bring disillusionment in relationships if you are expecting too much. You may feel discouraged as you begin to see someone more clearly. However, over-spiritualizing your emotions is tempting, for it's easier to forgive other people now than it is to share your true feelings. No matter what, it's healthier to tell the truth than to hide your desires in lofty generalizations."
taurus,2011-02-18,"The Leo Full Moon in your 4th House of Roots is a reflector that shines a bright light on family issues. Although jumping on a plane isn't likely now, you are tempted to take a journey of escape by going somewhere far away in your mind. But this is a time for being practical, not dreamy. Fantasies will only distract you from the important work at hand."
gemini,2011-02-18,"Today's Full Moon activates your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, signaling a significant change in your daily routine. You may think it's a good idea to tell everyone how busy you are now, but it's wise to examine your motives before you do. There really isn't much of a reason to complain, since you won't garner support until you deliver on the promises you previously made. There's no question about it: actions speak louder than words."
cancer,2011-02-18,"There could be a shift in your income status or, perhaps, a break in a partnership which will make you realize how economic pressures affect you. Today's Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Money, so you might only be concerned with the bottom line. Nevertheless, look at everything in a broader context now. Take yourself out of the picture so you can develop more compassion for others who are also experiencing uncertain times. A quick reality check will give you a more balanced perspective."
leo,2011-02-18,"The powerful Full Moon in your sign may stress your relationships and temporarily turn your life inside out. Thankfully, you probably know what you want now, but you must still show a bit of caution. You could unconsciously go on the offensive if anyone stands in your way. Keep in mind that it's not necessary to express everything you feel today. Wait until tomorrow before you say what's on your mind."
virgo,2011-02-18,"You may not feel the energy of this intense Full Moon until after it's over because it occurs in your 12th House of Secrets, leaving you in the dark. However, the Moon's shift into your sign early in the morning can bring a hidden feeling out into the open. Don't try to force something to happen; let the process unfold over the next couple of days."
libra,2011-02-18,"You may choose to work behind the scenes today, but the Full Moon in your 11th House of Friends suggests that you could be pulled out onto center stage anyhow. However, just as you get used to being in the spotlight, the scene begins to change. Try not to get hooked by other people's opinions of you now. If you don't take them so seriously, their criticism will be less painful. Listen to any constructive advice offered and ignore the rest."
scorpio,2011-02-18,"Your fame is fleeting, because the theatrical Leo Full Moon brightens your 10th House of Public Status and then quickly moves on to discerning Virgo. Even if you are at the top of your game, you can't sustain your momentum much longer. You could become so frustrated that you are tempted to quit a job that isn't meeting your expectations. Don't make any impulsive decisions now because you will probably change your mind again tomorrow."
sagittarius,2011-02-18,"Your travel plans might need extra attention today as something changes and you're sent back to the drawing board. Or, maybe, you're thinking that a recent decision about your education wasn't the best one. Still, it may be necessary to take a risk without fully knowing the consequences of your current actions. Ultimately the bold Leo Moon in your 9th House of Adventure shows you the wisdom of focusing on your personal goals and doing whatever it takes to reach your destination."
capricorn,2011-02-18,"You may be concerned about a financial decision today, yet it's not easy for you to ask someone for advice. Although others don't fully grasp your current situation, they seem to treat you as if you're the one missing something. Don't fall into the trap of allowing anyone else to manage your money. It makes the most sense now to take the extra time to do it yourself."
aquarius,2011-02-18,"Today's Full Moon is opposite the Sun and Neptune in your sign, reminding you of the contrast between the concrete things you must do and the unfulfilled dreams that lure you off the beaten path. Don't worry too much if you are letting others down because their expectations are likely very unrealistic now. Listening to what they want is a good idea, but this doesn't mean you must immediately fix whatever is broken."
pisces,2011-02-18,"Instead of stubbornly holding on to an old way of doing something, it's smarter to give your imagination free rein now that the Sun is moving into your visionary sign. But don't avoid managing the real issues that currently need addressing as today's Full Moon lights up your 6th House of Details. Ultimately, paying attention to the little things can make the difference between failure and success."
aries,2011-02-19,"You may imagine yourself to be as unrestrained as a soaring eagle today, but your responsibilities don't leave you enough freedom to actually take a flight of fancy. Even if you think you know the escape route, it's still complicated to make your first move. This is frustrating because you are usually skilled at starting something new. Don't judge yourself harshly for not following through on your feelings. For now, doing the best you can is good enough."
taurus,2011-02-19,"You might feel as if satisfaction is a long way off now because your key planet Venus is still squaring somber Saturn today. You may be exhausted from a very intense interaction at work with someone who makes you anxious. However, facing your fears is one way to push beyond the comfortable boundaries. Communication is challenging, yet the potential for transformation can bring you closer to your relationship goals."
gemini,2011-02-19,"Your feelings can push and pull you all over the emotional landscape today, making it nearly impossible to know what to do. It's not that you're wishy-washy; it's just hard to make a final decision when staying open to all the possibilities sounds better. One moment you're eager to cash in your chips and walk away. The next moment you're working hard trying to figure out how to save everything. An all-or-nothing answer is not acceptable when there is so much middle ground yet to explore."
cancer,2011-02-19,"You may have something very important to learn today if a close friend stands in the way of your progress. Unfortunately, your first impulse may be to turn a minor confrontation into a major fight. But you don't need to prove that you're better than anyone else. Instead, shift your attitude so you can minimize your own resistance, show your vulnerability and be more receptive of other people's feedback."
leo,2011-02-19,"Everything may seem more complicated than necessary today, yet you cannot simplify your life to reduce your current stress. The complexity arises from your heart desiring something that you just don't know how to get. Holding firm to your goals now is a smart strategy that should ultimately pay off, but you'll need to show some flexibility along the way."
virgo,2011-02-19,"You want to get ahead at work, but might not have the patience now that is required to succeed. You may feel frustrated because your job would be much easier without all the needless distractions from your personal life. Unfortunately, your friends and family aren't as supportive as you wish. Don't be afraid to set clear boundaries or withdraw from others in order to maintain your integrity."
libra,2011-02-19,"You may feel stuck today, as if your creativity is temporarily blocked. Your regular routine could fall apart now, making it impossible for you to concentrate on realizing your dreams. However, don't sell yourself short by thinking that you can't do the miraculous. You are more capable than you realize, but you must have faith and patience for positive results to manifest."
scorpio,2011-02-19,"You must decide if you can keep up social appearances today and still remain true to yourself. But your current choices aren't as crucial as they seem because they are part of a long-term process that can redefine the structure of your relationships. Your key planets, physical Mars and passionate Pluto, are intensifying your feelings as the boundary between friendship and romantic love is tested. There are no wrong decisions now; just be clear about your overall direction."
sagittarius,2011-02-19,"Someone might give you a hard time about taking yourself too seriously today. Nevertheless, there is a lot going on now. You don't like it when others disagree with you for no apparent reason other than spreading ill will, but it may be your own frustrations that are creating the bulk of the current stress. At least make sure that you continue to meet your obligations at home, even if you're still sorting out how to handle everything else."
capricorn,2011-02-19,"You may not be very happy if someone close to you wants something from you that you cannot deliver now. Unfortunately, these demands can precipitate a power struggle that won't likely have a winner because of interpersonal complications. Don't waste your energy trying to fix an irresolvable situation, instead change the rules of the game. It's not a competition; if anyone is a loser, then no one wins."
aquarius,2011-02-19,"Although you might want to shake up the status quo today, you won't be successful unless you acknowledge the current limitations that are part of your life. Fortunately, circumstances won't remain like this forever, even if you can't see a path that will take you to your destination. Trying too hard now only pushes your goal further away. Paradoxically, relaxing your grip on the future may be the best way to make sure that you get there on time."
pisces,2011-02-19,"You are tired of learning hard lessons today and may rebel just to stretch your muscles. You are tempted to stir conflict by questioning an authority figure if one appears to be too rigid in his or her approach. Examine your own role in fomenting the current tension. When you stop projecting your internal battles onto others, relationships will become much easier to manage."
aries,2011-02-20,Your attempts to hold on to a faulty assumption today are futile as an unscheduled reality check quickly grabs your attention and pulls you from your reverie. It's challenging to find a graceful way out of a difficult situation if you are caught up in your own idealism. It will take courage to be open enough to receive assistance from a close friend or partner. Don't be afraid of trying a different approach.
taurus,2011-02-20,"It's not easy to contain your dreams about your career today. Even if your goals seem to be just within reach, something can happen that forces you to see yourself in a new light. It's hard to maintain your balance because it feels as if you are on an emotional seesaw. Fortunately, the ride will stop soon and you will have a more realistic view of what you need to do in order to keep your plans moving forward."
gemini,2011-02-20,"Your key planet Mercury joins angry Mars and dreamy Neptune today, lifting your thoughts above the usual limitations of communication. Even your most mundane ideas can now be woven into a creative vision that leads you into the future. And the best part of this surprise is that you are able to materialize your fantasies if you are willing to work hard and then patiently wait for your rewards."
cancer,2011-02-20,"It's challenging for you to share your innermost thoughts now, even if you think they are very close to the surface. A collection of planets in your 8th House of Intimacy tempts you to keep your desires to yourself to avoid judgment by anyone else. Although remaining quiet seems like the easy way out, you'll be better off by revealing enough about yourself so that others are interested in knowing more."
leo,2011-02-20,"A friend might tell you a story today and you won't even realize that the truth has been exaggerated. Although you don't like being told lies, the larger issue is about how you can mislead yourself into believing anything you hear. It's crucial to be able to dream, but it's also necessary to discern when facts are stretched so far that they become a work of fiction."
virgo,2011-02-20,"Although you may choose to concentrate on activities that have to do with self-improvement today, you could end up having to put more effort into relationship issues than you originally planned. Telling a friend or partner what you want can lead to problems now because you may appear ungrounded at first. Keep talking; your persistence will pay off and eventually you will be taken more seriously."
libra,2011-02-20,"You may be looking at someone you love through a pair of rose-colored glasses today. However, you can quickly tire of idealistic perceptions, especially if they aren't practical enough to make real. Thankfully, there's no need to force something to happen; you are able to float along in your dreams without negative repercussions. Instead of searching for something to complain about now, indulge your fantasies while you still can."
scorpio,2011-02-20,"You might not fully understand everything that's going on at home or within your family now, and you may not be all that eager to figure it out. Sometimes it's smarter to just leave things alone. Unfortunately, it may be too late for you to remain uninvolved, especially if you've already shown your reaction. Don't pretend that nothing is happening at all. Instead, be honest; keeping your heart open can set the stage for a more meaningful interaction."
sagittarius,2011-02-20,"You may appear more courageous than you actually feel today because your curiosity is so strong that you can't sit still. However, you're probably more concerned than others realize, especially if you are unclear about what you should be doing now. Thankfully, your clarity should begin to return in the next day or two. In the meantime, do what you do best by inspiring others with your contagious enthusiasm."
capricorn,2011-02-20,"You want to tell others how to overcome their own fears now, yet first you may need to face a few of your own. You prefer a stable atmosphere where the clouds of illusion are not interfering with your work. Now, however, don't be afraid of your fantasies; you have the power to make your dreams come true. If you lead by example you won't have to say anything at all."
aquarius,2011-02-20,"Even if you are lost in your fantasies, stern Saturn brings you back to Earth today as someone with authority tells you what to do. However, you won't likely let others ruin your day and will probably find a way to avoid taking on extra work now. Although you like the idea of being productive, don't relinquish control to anyone else. Instead, meet your obligations while also expressing your own creativity."
pisces,2011-02-20,Your imagination is fired up in such a way today that you feel at one with your desire for spiritual enlightenment. But this isn't only about inspirational ideas or metaphysical studies; it's about embodying a practice that brings more meaning into your life. Set aside some time for meditation or prayer because you won't be satisfied now by just knowing the facts. Grab the chance to connect with your own heart in a more soulful manner.
aries,2011-02-21,"Your friends seem extra supportive today and you feel good about the role they play in your life. Their approval usually boosts your confidence, but you may not be able to shake a nagging suspicion that someone isn't so happy with your plans. You are worried that others aren't telling you their true feelings. If you dwell on expecting bad news, you might actually get it. This current wave of self-doubt will most likely pass if you remember the power of positive thought."
taurus,2011-02-21,"Your personal connection to your spiritual beliefs may gain power today. Although you have a very pragmatic approach to the specific jobs you must do, you're more interested in seeking meaning through your interactions with others and not by accumulating wealth. Working hard now is not about positioning yourself for a raise; it's about the feeling of camaraderie that you have with your associates. Remember, it's your emotional connections and not your material possessions that sustain you most."
gemini,2011-02-21,"You can see the brighter side of life today and you're feeling optimistic about yourself and your current plans. It's as if you have been freed to follow your dreams. However, this period of grace will not last long, so make the most of it while you can. Push yourself to reach your goals, but leave enough room for relaxation, too. Otherwise, you will wish you had taken some time for yourself once your life gets busier in the weeks ahead."
cancer,2011-02-21,"You might receive some long overdue professional recognition for work you did a while back. But this is no time to reminisce about your past achievements. Although your current transits are quite positive and may encourage you to rest on your laurels, there will be no future awards for your laziness. The extra effort you make today will have a positive impact, starting as soon as tomorrow."
leo,2011-02-21,"You are in a more playful frame of mind today and can make use of your clever intelligence to entertain others. Unfortunately, everything isn't all fun and games now because there's so much work to do. Self-confidence may be one of your strengths, but don't get too cocky about your ability to juggle your responsibilities or you might fall short while trying to handle too many things at once. Cut back on your commitments so you can do the best job possible."
virgo,2011-02-21,"You are hesitant to buy into the philosophy that everything happens for a reason. Although this concept might work for some people, it just causes you to lose your sharp analytical edge. Instead of relaxing your critical approach, acknowledge that your ability to separate out useful facts from useless noise is one of your greatest talents. Even if you're tempted to go along with someone else's plan, don't be afraid of trusting your own logic, instead."
libra,2011-02-21,"Yesterday's dreamy aspects are still affecting you, making it difficult to set sensible limits. Unfortunately, you could succumb to the temptation of overindulgence today, which can turn a positive experience into a negative one. Be vigilant and think about what is enough and what's too much. A small dose of self-restraint at the right time can be the key to your current success."
scorpio,2011-02-21,"Telling someone you trust about your intentions can be the first step in the process of turning your idea into a reality. But even if your path appears clear now, obstacles could surface unexpectedly and make your work more complicated. Fortunately, you are heading in the right direction and have the blessing of a steady cosmic wind blowing you toward your destination. Nevertheless, impulsive behavior can stir up avoidable trouble, so consider your next possible move carefully before taking action."
sagittarius,2011-02-21,"You may have trouble completing tasks today because there are so many magnificent distractions. Every which way you turn can reveal another adventure worth pursuing. However, if you are facing an impossible deadline, remember that the universe is more forgiving now than you may realize, so don't give up too soon. Perseverance can be your secret weapon in your quest for success."
capricorn,2011-02-21,"You may have a difficult time following up a new opportunity, especially if it's not what you were expecting. However, don't say no too quickly; it's wiser to seriously consider the offer before giving your final answer. Relentlessly focusing on your previous commitments usually works in your favor, but narrow-minded thinking can prevent you from seeing the advantages of changing your direction now."
aquarius,2011-02-21,"You are presented with an interesting idea today and it may be wise to listen closely to what's being offered. Ironically, you are less open to radical thinking now than usual. Perhaps you just don't want to deal with the complication of uncertainty at this time. Fortunately, you don't need to make any immediate decisions; your current sense of urgency is imagined and not actually real. Keep an open mind, but reserve the right to evaluate what you hear without giving your approval or rejection."
pisces,2011-02-21,"You are more attuned to the subtle vibrations of the cosmos today. You might even think that you are receiving assistance from the other side or that invisible spirits are watching over you. No matter what your beliefs are, be receptive to anything that originates from your imagination now. Be open to good advice, even if it's just your intuition giving you gentle guidance. Search for spiritual clues in your dreams."
aries,2011-02-22,"You may be growing more impatient day by day, especially if someone seems more interested in getting to the bottom of your feelings than moving on to whatever comes next. Nevertheless, taking your time and delving into an emotional issue might be just what you need right now. Set aside your desire for personal satisfaction for a day or two. Finish up old relationship business instead of distracting yourself with something new."
taurus,2011-02-22,"Your current feelings may not be obvious to others now, but that doesn't make them any less important. An old memory buried in a hidden corner of your mind can have unexpected power over your unconscious actions. Fortunately, a friend or partner should be able to help you see into the shadows of your past, but you must be willing to examine the issues as they surface. Don't shy away from the unknown because your vulnerability can lead to new emotional growth."
gemini,2011-02-22,"You might feel threatened by someone at work today as the primal Scorpio Moon intensifies your raw emotions and lessens your interest in playing fair. You are ready to defend yourself, even if you haven't been attacked. Fortunately, you may see the truth before there are any open hostilities exchanged. There's nothing in particular that you must do to experience the healing energy now. Thankfully, your change of heart can open a door to new opportunities."
cancer,2011-02-22,"The building cluster of planets in sympathetic Pisces encourages you to take your emotions even more seriously than usual. However, your fear of rejection might make you feel uncomfortable about sharing your innermost thoughts with others. You want intimacy, but you may not be ready yet for that level of emotional disclosure. Meanwhile, you are eager to grow professionally. Thankfully, concentrating on your career objectives might be a perfect distraction for now."
leo,2011-02-22,"You like the idea of being close to someone, but you prefer to remain lighthearted today. Unfortunately, several planets in your 8th House of Deep Sharing create a conflict between your desire for intimacy and your fear of vulnerability. You will not be satisfied now by keeping things on a superficial level. Don't try to rationalize your actions; instead, give yourself permission to follow your heart rather than your head."
virgo,2011-02-22,"You may take pride in being able to handle a lot of data when necessary, but you tend to prefer quality over quantity. Now, with five planets traveling through diffusive Pisces, it's more difficult for you to determine which information is reliable and useful. Instead of obsessing about what you don't know, nurture significant relationships based upon your feelings. But be careful not to overreact; getting too involved in the details now could lead you to miss the most obvious solutions to your current problems."
libra,2011-02-22,"Your emotional world may be settling down after a few days of lunar instability. But it's still challenging to keep your spirits up for long when sobering Saturn is visiting your sign. This is a serious time for you; even if opportunities abound, you might grow discouraged by an apparent lack of success. Nevertheless, concentrate on maintaining consistency in your daily routine because it will eventually bring you the satisfaction you seek."
scorpio,2011-02-22,"You may feel overwhelmed by your own thoughts today, until you stop resisting the emotional tides. Stress arises now from the inconsistency of the Moon as she visits your sign. Fluctuating moods complicate your interpersonal communication, making it difficult to know how quickly any emotion will last before transforming into something else. Don't waste energy worrying about things that are out of your control; your current anxieties will begin to settle down later in the week."
sagittarius,2011-02-22,"Although you may fear that you are approaching the end of a road, you are also at the start of something new. Instead of trying to stop the inevitable, finish what you can while the powerful Scorpio Moon is in your 12th House of Endings. Practicing detachment is a sensible plan now because you need to let go of your unrealistic expectations. Remember, you cannot do it all. Accept assistance when it's offered and consciously let go of anything that's beyond your control."
capricorn,2011-02-22,"You know what you need and where you're going today, but not necessarily how you'll get there. Still, you won't like it if others try to give you directions and you'll fight them if they push too hard. Nevertheless, it isn't worth turning a friend into an enemy, even if you have to temporarily hide your feelings to avoid conflict. A little compromise on your part can end up saving the day."
aquarius,2011-02-22,"You may feel as if you're being pressured to take on additional financial responsibility now, and you don't have a concrete plan for meeting the demands. Unfortunately, there may not be a lot of room for failure as others expect you to be the one who leads them out of the mess they created. Being realistic is a sensible strategy, but don't fall into the trap of self-doubt, because negativity won't help the situation. Concentrate on what you can do instead of on what you cannot."
pisces,2011-02-22,"Today's magnetic Scorpio Moon pushes you to extremes. This can present problems because five planets in imaginative Pisces blur the fine line between being spiritually inspired and losing yourself in a fantasy. Thankfully, you receive help from logical Mercury and practical Saturn, preventing your visions of the future from floating off into the clouds. Don't be afraid to dream; just make sure you are anchored to earth at the same time."
aries,2011-02-23,"It's usually challenging to slow down enough to explore your feelings, for you often are on to the next thing before you are finished processing the past. However, your key planet Mars is in directionless Pisces now, so you aren't as anxious to go anywhere at all. Luxuriate in the present moment; allow time to wash away any desire you might have to move on right away. You might even enjoy yourself once you get the hang of it."
taurus,2011-02-23,"There are people in your life now who seem to be more passionate than you are. You might want to avoid them because they can complicate things; however they can also teach you something important about yourself if you let them. Although you are tempted to build a wall of safety around you, this strategy will only make you feel lonelier. Even if you're trying to keep your life free from drama, it's wise to remain open to powerful emotional connections."
gemini,2011-02-23,"You slippery Geminis are champions of sailing across turbulent waters, without being overwhelmed by the emotional intensity. Today, however, the power of the currents can carry you into unfamiliar depths. Nevertheless, fighting against the prevailing tides will likely wear you out, so it's best to relax and go with the flow. Don't panic, you will be able to make your way back to familiar ground later on."
cancer,2011-02-23,"Although you may be fearful about surrendering to your feelings, a familiar sense of security will comfort you if you can release your worries and be one-hundred percent present in each moment. Fortunately, there is no need to figure anything out now; the time for analysis has passed. You ocean-going Crabs are equipped with gills and can therefore breathe under water. Deep diving is the best way to replenish your soul today."
leo,2011-02-23,"It's challenging to retain a sense of playfulness today because a primal emotional interaction may raise serious issues. You might even question your own wisdom, especially if your recent strategy hasn't brought you much happiness. But don't make any drastic changes to your plan just yet. Your perspective will change in the weeks ahead and you might realize then that everything is on course, even if you cannot see it that way right now."
virgo,2011-02-23,"You are able to make the best of a difficult situation now, even if your partner or a friend doesn't follow your preferred course of action. Although you may have been shocked recently by someone's unexpected behavior, you're prepared to do what you can to make your life a success. Fortunately, what you learn will ultimately increase your self-confidence and help you to clarify your priorities."
libra,2011-02-23,"You aren't thrilled about getting involved in a drama that you would rather avoid today. But it seems unlikely that you'll be able to outsmart fate now, and an unimportant interaction can suddenly turn into the main event. Instead of subordinating your needs to someone else's, focus on yourself for a change. Hold fast to your beliefs and don't let others lure you away from what you value most. If you maintain your integrity, things should turn out for the best."
scorpio,2011-02-23,"Although some conversations could be quite awkward today, there are still more topics of agreement than conflict. Unfortunately, something still feels out of control and you may not be able to stop digging until you reach the source of your concerns. Fortunately, you aren't required to discover any ultimate answers right away. If you are progressing in the right direction, you will have more time than you realize to keep on searching."
sagittarius,2011-02-23,"Although you may have a new sense of purpose today, it's based on an intangible feeling rather than a pragmatic idea. You intuitively know what sounds right, yet you are uncertain how to best manifest your dream. Don't push your current fantasy along too quickly; just revel in the idyllic beauty of your imaginative meanderings and see where they take you. You can always circle around later and create a concrete plan to reflect your new vision."
capricorn,2011-02-23,"You are thinking about taking a little spiritual retreat today, but you cannot escape your responsibilities, nor can you resist the many interesting temptations. However, you could become frustrated if you run around being busy without accomplishing what you promised. Do your best to stay focused on your obligations and leave your mini-holiday for another day."
aquarius,2011-02-23,"Your personal finances continue to be a major issue and, thankfully, you're now ready to do something about it because warrior Mars is in your 2nd House of Money. However, the best of intentions still may not be enough to fix the problem right away. Don't fall for your own overly simplistic solutions that are based on unrealistic hopes. Instead, make a solid plan and put it in motion, but allow sufficient time for tangible results to manifest."
pisces,2011-02-23,"Your energy level is strong now, and it's important to do something positive before your stamina begins to wane. Meanwhile, setting the tone for the coming month is crucial because spontaneous Mars stays in your sign until April 2. Mars also symbolizes physical exercise, so upgrade your workouts while it still matters. Don't wait for a better time to act; this is it."
aries,2011-02-24,"The truth may not sit well with you today, yet you have an opportunity to become aware of what you have been avoiding. Unfortunately, any impulsive decisions you make now won't likely bring you happiness. Keep your worries to yourself, since talking about them prematurely can dissipate your tension before you fully understand what's going on and can figure out the best plan of action."
taurus,2011-02-24,"You have been so keenly focused on your status at work that you might have lost sight of your long-term goals. Today it's time to shift gears and start thinking about your future, rather than the present. Naturally, you still must meet any current obligations, but you should be able to do that while also reconnecting with the very same dreams you set aside to get where you are. Don't wait any longer to make a wish that you want to come true."
gemini,2011-02-24,"You've been lost in fantasyland while imagining ways to escape from your mundane responsibilities. Whatever your idea of Utopia may be, you are scheming your way through the day and trying to manifest your dreams. However, there is an energetic shift today that reminds you of the promises you have not yet fulfilled. Fortunately, you can still feel free if you graciously accept what you must do, rather than attempting to avoid it."
cancer,2011-02-24,"A fresh batch of ideas is blowing new life into old plans that you mistakenly thought were beyond resuscitation. Don't let go of your goals; instead, it's time to refine them. Nevertheless, you may already feel somewhat nostalgic about what you have to leave behind. Thankfully, you won't likely miss the past too much once you realize how hopeful you feel about your newly unfolding future."
leo,2011-02-24,"Exploring new approaches to business and personal relationships has been an important theme in your life and it continues to be significant. However, now you are less concerned with being true to yourself than how you interact with others. The current pile-up of planets in your 8th House of Intimacy indicates that you must build on what you have already established while continuing to seek more meaning in everything that you do."
virgo,2011-02-24,"The recent concentration of planets in your 6th House of Details required you to pay close attention to your daily work routine. However, your 7th House of Relationships is now being emphasized and your awareness shifts to include those around you. Consider what you need from others and what you are able to offer them in return. Consciously expanding your horizons gives you a whole new perspective on your life."
libra,2011-02-24,"Considering how to be more effective on the job is now more important than starting anything new. You may choose to put your energy into your work today while passing on the possibility of an artistic pursuit or a romantic distraction. However, don't get discouraged if you run into obstacles. Instead of trying to accomplish too much too fast, take baby steps in whatever you do."
scorpio,2011-02-24,"Although your upbeat energy might seem more emotional than intellectual today, you are moving into a very creative phase as several planets dance through your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, you may have a hard time being spontaneous now. Additional planning will help you be more efficient, but overdoing it will take the excitement out of your day. Balancing your enthusiasm with a dash of common sense is the best strategy at this time."
sagittarius,2011-02-24,"Strong tides are pulling you into deep waters, yet the Moon's return to your sign enables you to go with the flow. Nevertheless, no matter how flexible your thinking is today, it's still hard to let go of old fears that return when you are not in control. Thankfully, your adventurous spirit wins out in the end and the unknown calls with a compulsive lure; you have no choice but to go forward. Don't get discouraged if you change your mind a few times in the process of unfolding your new destiny."
capricorn,2011-02-24,"New emotions surface at a fast pace these days, but you may not be able to express your feelings. It isn't that you need to keep secrets; you want to share your process as your emotions change. However, the right words are difficult to find now. Don't be too critical because you'll accomplish more in the days ahead with the support of your co-workers if you go easy on yourself and others."
aquarius,2011-02-24,"You are still adapting to the shift of several planets out of your sign and into your 2nd House of Self-Worth, refocusing your concerns from self-expression to stabilizing recent gains. Although money issues may be emphasized now, keep in mind that your income can be affected by your thoughts. Feeling good about yourself doesn't guarantee riches, but raising your self-esteem can better your chances for success."
pisces,2011-02-24,"Although you may be feeling more positive about your ability to get what you want, you still could face a minor setback today. However, your attitude plays a much more significant role in overcoming obstacles than you might imagine. If you mislead yourself into believing that you don't deserve success, then today's problems could grow larger than life. However, your dreams become more real when you accept that you have as much right to happiness as anyone else."
aries,2011-02-25,"You are hot to trot today, even if you know that it makes more sense to be patient. Unfortunately, you may not be willing to slow down enough to learn an important lesson because you're eager for action. Your strong self-confidence is an asset as long as you don't overplay your hand. Reduce your stress by trying to see things as they are, instead of as you want them to be."
taurus,2011-02-25,"You may be in for some good times today, but you'll need to moderate your desires or you could ruin a good thing before you know it. Seeking pleasure with reckless abandon will probably lead to trouble because overindulgence is not a smart idea. Setting clear priorities can help you manage your day, so figure out what's most important and then get busy."
gemini,2011-02-25,"You can finally gain traction on a project that has taken a long time to get going, but you must narrow your vision and focus your energy. Thankfully, you're motivated because you can see the tangible results from your recent hard work. Your key planet Mercury enables you to speak with power, and the same folks who were once in your way are now trying to help you advance. However, there's no reason to think that you will get everything you want, but a positive attitude can definitely improve your chances for success."
cancer,2011-02-25,"You are more self-assured today than others may realize. Your friends and associates might misinterpret your quiet approach and believe that you lack the necessary confidence. However, your caution about sharing your feelings is not about being insecure. If you don't like putting others in an emotionally awkward position, wait until you feel more comfortable before expressing yourself."
leo,2011-02-25,"You may be called upon to shine in the leading role of your own drama today. In practice, however, you won't be able to carry the entire performance on your own, so make sure you spend some time garnering the support of others. Sharing the spotlight isn't difficult now, as long as you are with someone who is willing to play a supporting role in your real life movie."
virgo,2011-02-25,"Although you may be bouncing all over the emotional map today, your people skills are functional enough to get you the help you want. But there's no need to rush to set major career or relationship goals. Instead of focusing on the distant future, live your life in the here and now. Take a calculated risk and do something that has meaning only in the present moment. This is an excellent opportunity to break out of the boring status quo."
libra,2011-02-25,"You may be at your most charming and creative now that your key planet Venus is forming a beautiful quintile with anything-goes Uranus. The uplifting Sagittarius Moon allows you to build on your good intentions and to get away with more than usual. However, it's not a good idea to test these limits. Instead of just sharing your true feelings today, express yourself in a way that emphasizes the positive aspects of the relationship."
scorpio,2011-02-25,"Your attitude toward money has probably grown more positive in recent days. You might even start to think that you're going to get exactly what you want. Nevertheless, you could underestimate the cost of a coveted item or overestimate its potential importance to you. If you spend money today, make certain that it's for something you truly desire."
sagittarius,2011-02-25,"The Moon's visit to your fiery sign encourages you to feel great, even if you are simultaneously processing more complicated issues. Thankfully, your emotions need not stand between you and success now, although there is no reason to be overly sentimental. Your feelings may even act as a catalyst, helping you to discover a path to happiness. Pay close attention to your inner process, but don't dwell on it to the exclusion of what's happening around you."
capricorn,2011-02-25,You are driven to share your big ideas today because you know how fragile your overall plan is while it's in the beginning stages. You probably haven't had enough time to fill in all the details and you need everyone's feedback to help you clarify your own thoughts. Don't rush the creative process; slow down and solidify your strategy. Begin on the ground floor and work your way up.
aquarius,2011-02-25,"The storm clouds have temporarily lifted and you are jubilant that you can once again see the horizon. There doesn't seem to be a lot that could get in your way now, but too much bravado might create its own set of problems. It's easy to miss a critical piece of data or respond too quickly to an event. Nevertheless, a positive outcome is likely today, so don't waste a lot of time worrying about what might go wrong."
pisces,2011-02-25,"You may fall so in love with your own dreams today that you wish you could manifest them in the real world. But don't just leave your thoughts to wander around in your mind. Instead of wondering where an idea will take you, be proactive and consciously guide your imagination where you want it to go. Once you create a mental picture that makes you happy, consider how to make your fantasies come true."
aries,2011-02-26,"You are eager to fulfill a recent promise now and might work so hard that you ignore your friends. Anyone who gets in your way today may be in trouble, especially if he or she becomes the temporary target of your frustration. Your smartest strategy is to deconstruct a large job into smaller tasks that can be accomplished individually. Taking lots of tiny steps is more productive than blindly rushing ahead."
taurus,2011-02-26,"Although your common sense has returned today, your fantasies have not faded. In spite of your current down-to-earth perspective, you are holding on to your dreams with more determination than ever. There's little room for any kind of distractions, so keep your focus on your goals in spite of the temporary setbacks you encounter along the way. Don't let this chance to achieve success slip through your fingers."
gemini,2011-02-26,"You may be somewhat uncomfortable today if you must deal with a complicated emotional issue. It's not that self-doubt is your problem; to the contrary, you could feel very confident now. However, you prefer to keep the discussion on a rational level when everyone else's feelings continue to resurface. Your attempts to avoid the intensity might only increase the discord, so relax and let the conversations unfold naturally. Sharing your fear of losing control can turn the tide in your favor."
cancer,2011-02-26,"Although you may often be the emotional one in the group, it's likely that someone else's feelings will destabilize a tricky situation today. You wish that everyone would be more careful about saying things that could be hurtful. Your natural sensitivity enables you to see that a respectful and kind approach improves the chances of restoring balance in a relationship. Nevertheless, once everything is out in the open, you should be able to deal with the depth of a problem more easily."
leo,2011-02-26,"You become a stickler for details when the Moon enters your methodical 6th house today. You might insist that your workmates hold up their end of the deal and do what they promised. But your standards may be more exacting than anyone else's, even though you believe that you're going easy on them. It's admirable to strive for perfection, but allow room for everyone to be human."
virgo,2011-02-26,"You'll be eager to kick back and enjoy yourself today once you have fulfilled your obligations. But don't passively wait for an invitation; do something that enables you to express yourself in a creative way. It's likely that others will resist making commitments now, so don't count on them joining you on your escapade. It's wonderful to have company, but there's something thrilling about venturing out on your own."
libra,2011-02-26,"Although you are often known as the peacemaker, you may be eager to stir up a bit of trouble today. Your anger could boil over now, especially if you think that you're being taken for granted. Participating in an interactive process can certainly be fulfilling, but not if others won't take the time to recognize who you are and what you do. Nevertheless, having a major meltdown isn't the best way to get noticed. Clearly state your case without backing down; however, don't blame others along the way."
scorpio,2011-02-26,"There's no reason to waste time beating around the bush today. You have something important to say and any attempt to withhold your feelings will likely just make them stronger. The Moon's conjunction with your key planet Pluto activates your 3rd House of Communication, inspiring you to express what's on your mind. Pick up the phone, write an email or fall back on the old-fashioned method of actually talking face to face."
sagittarius,2011-02-26,"You may be forced today to handle an unpleasant situation that brings up old issues about your self-esteem. Naturally, you're capable of demonstrating your confidence, but now it's a convenient cover for a deep insecurity that you want to keep to yourself. Ultimately, it takes a lot less energy to share what you're feeling than to hide it. Additionally, the subsequent conversations just might bring you closer to someone you like. Softening your defenses and being vulnerable is a sign of strength, not weakness."
capricorn,2011-02-26,"You might feel the emotional pressure building inside you like a smoldering volcano today. You can try to rationalize your strategy, but it's not wise to keep your passions buried beneath the surface now. If you want to avoid the consequences of an uncontrollable eruption, express yourself instead of slipping into denial. Begin slowly by letting off a little steam. Self-revelation isn't easy, but opening up your heart to someone you trust is the first step toward improving your relationships."
aquarius,2011-02-26,"Your fantasies may be running amok now, so pay careful attention to your surroundings. Unfortunately, you might not be able to stop thinking, even if you don't like where your thoughts take you. Your best strategy today is to simply observe your inner process with as much objectivity as possible. Instead of getting agitated by attempting to redirect your dreams, just let them come and go on their own."
pisces,2011-02-26,"You aren't necessarily looking for trouble today, but it might just find you anyway. Retreating back into the safety of your home seems like a good way to avoid an uncomfortable situation. However, you may internalize your current anxiety unless you face it directly. Keeping your cool even when you are caught up in the drama of the moment will allow the tension to fade quickly."
aries,2011-02-27,"Being patient today is an intelligent way to improve your chances of reaching your goals. But this is not an excuse to turn into a couch potato. Relaxing for a while is fine, but being lazy when you have things to do is not in your best interest. Establishing a steady pace will help you get your chores out of the way so you can chill out later."
taurus,2011-02-27,"If you have been thinking about going somewhere exotic, this may be a perfect time to continue your exploration of the possibilities. Making a plan about a future adventure is a good idea now because you are able to balance fantasy with reality. Visualize all the alternatives and then choose the path that makes the most sense."
gemini,2011-02-27,"Taking on a bit less work today could enable your feelings to rise to the surface. This new awareness might make you uncomfortable because it's often easier for you to fly off and leave an issue unresolved. Ironically, although you're able to make a crucial emotional breakthrough now, you cannot allow yourself to be completely distracted from your chores. Try not to take on any new projects and put all non-essential communication on hold for a couple of days."
cancer,2011-02-27,"You may have a difficult time expressing your love toward someone who obviously wants more attention from you. You might choose to withdraw, yet others won't realize that you are coming from a place of good intentions. Although you may be afraid of getting too close to someone, you also don't want to bother anyone with your shortcomings. However, rationally facing your fears gives you a chance to break through an emotional barrier and deepen an existing relationship."
leo,2011-02-27,"Health concerns may come to the forefront now as you fight off a slight cold or deal with a minor infection. Even if you are feeling great, consider making some kind of improvement to your current exercise program or changing your diet. Creating routines that increase your overall well-being have more impact now than usual."
virgo,2011-02-27,"Managing your schedule creatively for the next few days can give you a much-needed edge while the Moon is lighting up your 5th House of Fun and Games. Of course, you still have to take care of your other obligations, but with a little foresight, you'll also be able to find time for play. Your life is not just about being responsible; whether you engage in sports, social activities or a favorite hobby, make certain that you replenish your soul."
libra,2011-02-27,"You may need to pay extra attention to family matters today. Fortunately, this doesn't mean there's a big problem, but domestic responsibilities can get in the way of other more enjoyable commitments. Don't complain about what you have to do; just prioritize your tasks and get started. You may be surprised that you can finish nearly everything in less time than you expected."
scorpio,2011-02-27,"If you've been procrastinating recently, this is a great day to jump back in and take care of unfinished business. The efficient Capricorn Moon is visiting your 3rd House of Communication, so write an email or make a phone call about an important issue that has been bothering you. Tying up loose ends requires concentration and energy, but you'll surely feel good about your efforts once the day is over."
sagittarius,2011-02-27,"You may get an unexpected benefit today from sharing your concerns about a personal failure or disappointment with a friend. The supportive feedback you receive can reveal a new way for you to see yourself. The information you get now isn't radically new; it's just that you are currently more open to hearing the truth. Paradoxically, your vulnerability can ultimately improve your self-esteem."
capricorn,2011-02-27,"You may be quite confident in your ability to reach your goals as the Moon in your sign squares optimistic Jupiter. Being self-assured is usually a blessing, but you could find yourself in trouble if you take on more responsibilities than you can manage. Be as realistic as possible; if you aren't sure about how much effort something will require, talk it over with a family member or friend before just saying yes."
aquarius,2011-02-27,"Don't be hard on yourself if reality feels somewhat boring today. Your current dreams seem bigger than life, but they are not necessarily a distraction. Your fantasies may be your way of imagining your future. You are able to explore alternative life paths by placing yourself right in the picture. Trust your intuition; let your mind wander now and make plans later."
pisces,2011-02-27,"It doesn't feel like work if you are taking care of someone you love today. You're probably willing to do more than is expected of you. And although you may feel very good about what you are doing for others, it's important that you don't go overboard. Taking your role too seriously can leave you exhausted. Reserve some of your nurturing and pampering for yourself."
aries,2011-02-28,"You may be annoyed that circumstances aren't cooperating with you today, requiring you to manage an unexpected situation. Although you won't necessarily mind a surprise or two, you aren't ready to surrender. Intuitively, you know that progress can elude measurement. The real gains you make now come from a change in your attitude, so establish a steady pace you can maintain all day without worrying about the final product."
taurus,2011-02-28,"You may feel as if you are running around today without getting much done. Fortunately, you can accomplish more than you expect as long as you don't get lazy and slow down. You can make significant progress while still enjoying yourself, but you must be willing to work hard. The key to success now is about establishing priorities, so make a list of your goals before you get started."
gemini,2011-02-28,"You might expect the hectic pace of your life to settle down now, but instead you seem to face one problem after another. Even if your day runs smoothly, your curiosity drives you to search for answers to a whole list of questions. Instead of scattering your attention, get back to the basics and focus on the most practical issues in your life. Methodically tying up loose ends today will go a long way toward preventing them from unraveling later on."
cancer,2011-02-28,"Usually, you don't like it when someone else makes a decision for you, but now it might come as a relief. Take your cues from a trusted friend or associate today, since others will likely steer you in the right direction. Be careful, though, about relying on your own instincts, for your unfulfilled desires could negatively influence your ability to choose wisely. However, receiving sound advice doesn't lessen your responsibility; ultimately, it's up to you to make the final choice."
leo,2011-02-28,"You don't like being tied to a predetermined course of action, but you're clever enough to see when something is for your own good. You may need to swallow your feelings and just plod ahead with your job, especially if you don't want to be seen as a person who doesn't follow through on a promise. Get to work; there's no time to waste now. Actions speak louder than words."
virgo,2011-02-28,"Everyone is looking to you now because your pragmatic outlook is exactly what is needed today. It may seem like others are coming to you for assistance because they're trying to make up for lost time. It doesn't matter that you might be ready to slow down a bit; you'll probably end up helping your friends, anyway. Don't just do what's expected of you because you think you should. Act from the heart or don't do it at all."
libra,2011-02-28,"Family responsibilities continue to interfere with your work now, but you can handle it if you are careful about time management. You know that what you're doing is important, so you won't likely quit before you are truly finished. Remember, approval from others isn't all that it's cracked up to be; instead follow your conscience. There's no stopping you if your actions are aligned with your heart."
scorpio,2011-02-28,"Setting a steady pace allows you to accomplish a lot more than you ever thought possible. But don't commit to more than you can deliver, for the pressure you place on yourself won't be productive. Your ability to be realistic is more crucial than almost anything else now. Thankfully, your honest reaction is something you can give others without a lot of extra effort on your part."
sagittarius,2011-02-28,"You are feeling quite stable today, even in the face of uncertainty. Your determination to finish a job -- and do it well -- may win the admiration of your workmates.  But don't lose any sleep over trying to come up with a spectacular idea. Your smartest strategy now is to stick to the nuts and bolts until your work is done."
capricorn,2011-02-28,"Although you can often be the champion of responsibility, your current mindset enables you to blend your competence with a disarming emotional vulnerability. Fortunately, the Moon's visit to your 1st House of Personality allows you to present a softer side without sacrificing reliability. Even if you want to maintain your air of authority, you will be happier if you listen to your heart."
aquarius,2011-02-28,"You may not understand your feelings today, but this doesn't mean that you should try to bury them. Although you are capable of keeping your personal issues to yourself, denying them isn't a healthy strategy. Be wise and consider what is most appropriate at work before reacting impulsively. It's always a good idea to be more aware of your emotions before responding in any complex situation."
pisces,2011-02-28,"You may be called upon to help someone clean up an emotional mess today, especially if you were involved in creating the drama. A recent statement might have offended someone, so take the time to smooth over any feelings that were inadvertently wounded. Set a good example for others to follow by speaking your mind while also remaining kind and compassionate."
aries,2011-03-01,Think twice before doing something that you might quickly regret. It doesn't really matter if your intentions are good; you are so wrapped up in your needs that you could hurt someone's feelings without even realizing what you did. Just because a plan makes immediate sense to you doesn't mean that others will share your perspective. Talking things over with those you love will help in more ways than one.
taurus,2011-03-01,"Even if you have been extremely cautious about expressing your needs, today you could strike like lightning and, in a flash, tell someone exactly what you want. Unfortunately, this could be a case of sharing too much information too quickly. Your ability to conform to social norms is impaired by unconventional Uranus' sextile to your key planet Venus. Just because you want to color outside the lines now doesn't mean that others will want to join you."
gemini,2011-03-01,"Although you may be out to have some innocent fun, others could see your behavior as unnecessarily contrarian. Your expressions of individuality make you appear argumentative today, but you cannot be responsible for other people's feelings, especially if they are so sensitive that they take offense to everything you do. Consider the consequences before you cross the line of good taste. Respecting everyone else's boundaries is always a smart idea."
cancer,2011-03-01,"Others around you seem to be enjoying the day, yet you are challenged with a familiar dilemma. You are being asked to choose between holding on to the status quo and making changes that will cut you loose from your past. Although you are eager to find a progressive solution, it's not easy for you to let go of what you have now. Thankfully, you won't have to turn your life upside down to move into the future. If you start by taking one small step at a time, you can reach your goals sooner than you think."
leo,2011-03-01,"It's difficult for you to act with moderation, and your desire for extreme emotional interactions could stir up trouble today. You don't see why you should have to curtail your desire for fun. You know what makes you feel good and you're willing to involve others in your plan to find pleasure. Unfortunately, more is not always better. Figure out where your limits are before you go beyond them."
virgo,2011-03-01,"Sharing all your feelings may not be the smartest thing to do today because you could shock others with your true desires. Surprising someone with what you really want may not be the worst thing in the world, but your intentions could be misunderstood. In fact, even a warm smile might be misinterpreted as an act of aggression. You don't think you're being too pushy, but your intensity can make others uncomfortable. Moderate your approach by asking for less while consciously softening the tone of your voice."
libra,2011-03-01,"Your ruling planet Venus receives an electric shock from lightning-like Uranus today, zapping your personal life with possibilities that may be very destabilizing. Perhaps someone from work tries to distract you with an exciting invitation. Saying yes sounds like a good idea, but your involvement could create more trouble than fun. Give yourself permission to play, but don't take it too far. If you overdo it, instant karma just might get you."
scorpio,2011-03-01,"You are able to speak and act with the power of your convictions now. Your originality can be more persuasive than you realize. Just make sure you know when to ease up in your approach. If you appear too aggressive today, you can ruin your chances for success. However, practicing flexibility and patience enables you to make the progress you desire."
sagittarius,2011-03-01,"Your hopes loom so large now that it feels as if you can reach out and touch your dreams. But everything is exaggerated these days, making it difficult to judge the real importance of your goals. Your current excitement warps your objectivity and clouds your common sense. If something looks very attractive today, wait a day or two before making any final decisions."
capricorn,2011-03-01,"You may feel relieved now that you get to have some fun. However, it's challenging to keep it all in perspective because you can see that life will become serious again in the weeks ahead. You want to let loose, but you can't shake the gnawing feeling that you should be doing something else that will prepare you for what's ahead. It's still a smart idea to enjoy yourself when the chance is presented; you'll accomplish more at work if you also make time to relax."
aquarius,2011-03-01,"A lovely surprise could brighten your day in a way that's totally unexpected. Nevertheless, you get to decide how to respond. Sweet Venus forms a supportive sextile with your key planet Uranus today, turning up the volume on your desires. Although you may have a hard time balancing all the variables, you don't want to miss this special opportunity. Remember, a little moderation will save your day -- taking on too much could spread you too thin."
pisces,2011-03-01,"Sexy Venus is flirting with wild Uranus in your sign today, tempting you to say yes before you even know where you're going. You may be seeing green lights, but keep in mind that things could change instantaneously if you don't stay aware of everything that's happening around you. Avoid any unpleasant surprises by focusing on the present moment throughout the entire day, instead of always thinking about what's next."
aries,2011-03-02,"New ideas are blowing in on a fresh breeze and you are eager to see which ones could positively impact your life. This is an ideal time to test a strategy that you have been considering; within a day or two you will be able to tell whether or not it will fly. Don't worry about others judging your efforts, because if your plan works, they will probably jump on board. For now, just give it your very best and see how it goes."
taurus,2011-03-02,"Although you want to be accepted by your associates at work, communicator Mercury runs into resistant Saturn in your 11th House of Friends, tying your words up into complicated knots. Unfortunately, the harder you try to explain yourself, the more frustrated everyone becomes. Your best strategy now is to change the game completely by retreating and saying as little as possible. Patience leads to success; being part of the group will be easier after the New Moon on Friday."
gemini,2011-03-02,"You could become very restless now if you feel isolated. It's better to be around other people today because you believe that they will help to bring out the best in you. You don't even need to have a pre-arranged agenda because you have a lot to offer just as you are. Remember, you have nothing to prove, so it's not necessary for you to assume a leadership role. Just take advantage of any opportunity to spend time with people you respect."
cancer,2011-03-02,"It's challenging to keep your ideas to yourself today because there are things you want to do and the support of others can be the key to your success. Normally, you might not enjoy expending so much energy, but now you are enthused by your long-term goals and are willing to take your plans to the next level. It will be easier to spend the day in motion if you consider it a moving meditation that helps to align your soul with its current purpose."
leo,2011-03-02,"Someone charming might enter your life now that sweet Venus is warming up your 7th House of Relationships. Although there could be enticing chemistry between the two of you, he or she may prove to be somewhat emotionally detached. Nevertheless, remain open to whatever possibilities come your way or a wonderful friendship or romance won't even have a chance of getting off the ground."
virgo,2011-03-02,"You may be more interested in all kinds of relationships now. You might want to start up a new business or personal partnership, or simply put more effort into an existing one. Thankfully, your current needs are supported by your eagerness to interact on a one-on-one basis with someone you admire. But don't push too hard or you might scare others away instead of attracting them to join you on your adventure."
libra,2011-03-02,"Your attraction to a playful and loving romance intensifies now. However, even if someone special has entered your life, he or she might be too busy with other activities to slow down and engage in a meaningful relationship. Be flexible and let a friendship evolve organically. Planning isn't necessary at this time; spontaneous self-expression works best."
scorpio,2011-03-02,"You are creating new ways of relating to your home and family now that loving Venus is visiting your 4th House of Emotional Roots. However, this is not about de-emphasizing the rest of your life in favor of becoming more domestic. It's about being active in the outer world while learning how to make the most of your time. Balancing your personal life with what you do in your career and out in the community can be an important ingredient to your current happiness."
sagittarius,2011-03-02,"You are looking forward to more adventure in your life and are quick to say yes now to nearly anything that others may suggest. Unfortunately, your enthusiasm could land you in trouble if you don't stop to think about the consequences of your actions before impulsively jumping in. Take a few moments to consider the impact of what you are about to do. A touch of caution may be enough to sidestep a difficult situation later and, luckily, it probably won't even interfere with your fun."
capricorn,2011-03-02,"You continue to seek new ways to amuse yourself, but could end up regretting your actions if you follow every distraction that comes along. As much as you want to avoid boredom today, don't waste your energy running around looking for something to do. Focus your attention on ideas that could increase your income now that Venus is traveling through your 2nd House of Money. What begins as a dream could turn into something very valuable if you're willing to put in the extra work."
aquarius,2011-03-02,"Charming Venus in your friendly sign warms up your life with her visit to your 1st House of Personality until March 26. This is your time to upgrade your appearance and embark on a personal makeover. You could change your hairstyle or update your wardrobe. However, this isn't only about your looks or how you spend money; it's also about expressing your desires. Don't be afraid to go out on a limb and let others know what you want, even if you think that they may be surprised with what you tell them."
pisces,2011-03-02,"Although you may be comfortable with your current circumstances, it's best not to become too attached to the status quo. You might not like the idea of so much stress now, but the outcome will be better if you initiate the action yourself, instead of waiting for something scary to happen. Keep in mind that the possibility of unexpected change may be more unsettling to others than to you. At least you realize that a shift is necessary to create the stability you desire."
aries,2011-03-03,"Although you are able to get in touch with your inner warrior today, it's not easy to follow through with decisive action. Ironically, you might feel a bit overwhelmed, even if you are motivated to take charge of your life. If you don't know where to start, ease up and give yourself permission to float without direction for a while. There's no need to drive yourself crazy because you'll regain your bearings naturally by next week."
taurus,2011-03-03,"Your friends may annoy you today if they don't follow through on their promises. You may become frustrated by their unreliability, but it won't likely be severe enough to provoke your wrath. Accept full responsibility for your emotions by depending on others less and taking more initiative on your own. Fortunately, if you are aligned with your purpose now, you'll have a deep well of strength upon which to draw."
gemini,2011-03-03,"It's difficult to make up your mind today, even if you thought you were sure of your position. If you know what's right for you now, you may be reconsidering your previous decision very soon. Although you could be accepting of your adaptable nature, someone else may view your fickle behavior as counterproductive. However, don't worry about what anyone else currently thinks. Just give others the same consideration if they choose to change their minds, too."
cancer,2011-03-03,"The intensity of your feelings makes you feel rejuvenated today because their depth puts you in touch with an endless supply of energy. You're highly motivated to do something about your passions now, instead of just reflecting on them. Don't worry if you make someone feel a little uncomfortable. Even if you usually tend to be cautious, letting loose is a good exercise for your soul."
leo,2011-03-03,"Your inner reality may be in conflict with a current set of circumstances as a tricky situation comes to a head today. You could even temporarily lose your temper, but the results of showing your emotions will probably make everyone feel better in the long run. However, carrying on like a child won't make anyone happier. Find less extreme ways in which to communicate your needs and others will be more likely to listen."
virgo,2011-03-03,"It's not fun being bossed around by someone who isn't as efficient or smart as you are, and today you're not willing to do all the work while someone else gets the credit. Fortunately, there is no need to do anything drastic to draw attention to yourself. If you continue to pursue your goals and follow your work ethic, others will eventually appreciate your unique contribution."
libra,2011-03-03,"You may need to work extra hard today, yet it seems as if you're not making a lot of progress. Your relentless effort and unwavering hope combine to produce an unbeatable strategy now. Set aside any possible discouragement, for you are probably much closer to the finish line than you suspect. And, thankfully, once you reach your destination, others will acknowledge the valuable accomplishments you have achieved along the way."
scorpio,2011-03-03,"Physical movement is more critical than usual as your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, flood you with energy. Unfortunately, words may not convey the intensity of your feelings, so a discussion, however heated, might leave you in a state of frustration. However, you'll be able to break up the tension and settle your nerves by taking a brisk walk or working out at the gym."
sagittarius,2011-03-03,"You might be confused about your priorities today, but your problems may not be observable by anyone else. Your current dilemma could have you digging deep to question the relationship between your personal interactions and your soul's purpose. You don't need to have all the answers now; just be honest about your feelings, even if you don't understand where they're leading you."
capricorn,2011-03-03,"You may feel like a winner today and, if necessary, are capable of fighting like a champ. Your strength of conviction empowers you to take a stand for something that's especially meaningful to you. However, pick your battles carefully because it's not healthy to waste energy over an unimportant ego skirmish where no one will come out ahead. Others will be more likely to listen if you seek more subtle ways of expressing yourself, rather than pursuing open conflict."
aquarius,2011-03-03,"There are no quick fixes to an ongoing financial problem, although carefully considered action now can have a positive impact on your circumstances. Fortunately, your current money dilemma has a solution if you are willing to get serious and apply your undivided attention to the situation. Luckily, you can benefit from a smart plan and a strong commitment, so take your time, set priorities and act with fierce intention."
pisces,2011-03-03,"There can be a big difference between your sense of yourself and how someone else perceives you today. You may believe that you are simply responding to a situation normally, but your reactions are swifter and stronger than usual, possibly causing others to think that you're using unnecessary force. Minimize the current tension by softening your stance and lowering the volume of your voice. Exhibiting flexibility will reduce the intensity all the way around."
aries,2011-03-04,"It doesn't matter how excited you are about a current project or a social cause, you still may withdraw from the front lines as today's New Moon highlights your 12th House of Spirituality. Worldly success is less interesting now as your intuition speaks to you in ways that draw your attention inward. There's no need for concern; this temporary state of contemplation will only inspire you to greater heights."
taurus,2011-03-04,"Your priorities are changing and today's New Moon in your 11th House of Future is just another reminder that what's ahead is more important than whatever is happening right now. It's not that current events don't need your attention; it's just that your long-term goals go a long way to infuse your life with meaning. Don't stress about what you do to pay the rent. Instead, dream of ways to align your work with a larger spiritual purpose."
gemini,2011-03-04,"You may be feeling quite successful today with the charismatic Pisces New Moon activating your 10th House of Career. Others see you as larger than life now, even if you secretly fear that another person could take over your leadership role in an instant. It's useless to waste time worrying about things you can't control. Nothing is to be gained by making comparisons; a smarter strategy is to simply show up and give it everything you got."
cancer,2011-03-04,"Although you may be uncertain about what comes next, your willingness to express your emotions clearly can still help you get what you want. Others may be surprised by your boldness as you take over a complicated situation that appears to be beyond anyone's control. Luckily, you receive an energetic boost from the New Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Don't just talk about what you can do; make it happen."
leo,2011-03-04,"The sensitive Pisces New Moon influences your 8th House of Intimacy, making you less satisfied in any partnership where the other person doesn't match your level of intensity. You may not have a wide spectrum of responses when it comes to expressing your current intentions. For now, it's either all or nothing with very few options falling in between. Thankfully, you can lessen your disappointment by acknowledging that your expectations may be somewhat warped today. Things are not as extreme as they seem."
virgo,2011-03-04,"It's not that your efforts don't count today; there is always something else that you can do to improve upon what's already been done. But now you aren't that interested in tackling a project by yourself. The New Moon in your 7th House of Partners reminds you that sharing the responsibilities also means sharing in the recognition and the rewards, so be flexible in your negotiations with others. A mutually beneficial agreement can contribute nicely to your success."
libra,2011-03-04,"You feel as if you're coming off a creative high now and you may become frustrated as the energy begins to wane. Keep in mind that it's time to shift gears as today's New Moon in your 6th House of Work reveals an increasing need to be practical. Making something original isn't sufficient; it must also be useful. However, in your haste for efficiency, don't forget about the value of beauty just for the sake of artistic expression."
scorpio,2011-03-04,"Your sensual desires may be aroused by the emotional Pisces New Moon in your 5th House of Romance. However, there are many ways to creatively express what's in your heart. Consider starting a project simply for the enjoyment it could bring. Instead of scheming to achieve success today, give yourself permission to act spontaneously without concern for acknowledgment or financial remuneration."
sagittarius,2011-03-04,"Today's New Moon activates your 4th House of Psychological Roots, yet you might not be comfortable with reconnecting to some aspect of your personal history. You would rather shoot your arrow toward the horizon, yet current circumstances may prevent you from progressing as quickly as you prefer. Don't waste time daydreaming about your past; instead, use your imagination to tell others what makes you feel excited about the future. Looking ahead with passion could be enough to set you back on track."
capricorn,2011-03-04,"You may be blessed with the support you want from close friends and acquaintances today as the New Moon emphasizes your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. You are progressing along a path that's illuminated by what you learn from others. The very same people who have been in your life in other roles are now becoming your teachers. However, you have to be willing to listen without turning anyone into a guru or setting someone up onto a pedestal."
aquarius,2011-03-04,"You may be inclined to ask for a long overdue raise or to increase the rate you charge for your services today. Even if you deserve more money, current circumstances suggest that you must be patient if you are to get what you want. However, the psychic Pisces New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Personal Possessions, so trust your intuition when it comes to creating a plan to augment your income."
pisces,2011-03-04,"The Pisces New Moon affects you strongly today. You like to consider yourself part of the greater whole, so individualism can often be rather confusing for you. Nevertheless, you may feel the need to be alone now, making interactions with your friends and co-workers more challenging than usual. Instead of waiting to see how others react, try expressing yourself more spontaneously. You can always join back up with the school of other Fish later on."
aries,2011-03-05,"Your unrealistic fantasies could spin out of control today as the Moon completes her visit to your 12th House of Imagination. As much as you try to focus on your responsibilities, they may be left to fulfill another day. You prefer to continue your active dreaming now, although you will likely pay the price for any current escapist behaviors. Instead of wasting your time and energy complaining about how much there is to do, just get on with it so you can relax later."
taurus,2011-03-05,In the blink of an eye you can amaze yourself today by remembering something about your dreams of the future that's been eluding you. It's as if you find a missing clue without even searching for it. Your new point of view will probably still go through some ups and downs as your strategy continues to develop. Be prepared for your elation to fade into disappointment as you begin the hard work in front of you. You will feel better once you start to see that you're making progress toward reaching your goals.
gemini,2011-03-05,"Your desire for freedom at work may be complicated by previously made promises, placing you in the middle of your own dilemma. Of course, you want to take care of your personal responsibilities, even if heading out into the big wide world sounds more exciting now. Remember that your newly found independence won't mean as much unless you also maintain the peace at home. Don't run away just because the grass looks greener on the next hill today."
cancer,2011-03-05,"You may be dreaming about going on an incredible adventure, and could grow so confident that for a moment you actually believe that anything is possible. Unfortunately, something unexpected could happen today to remind you that you're not as free as you think. Don't let yourself wallow in your own discouragement. Scale back your vision to a more pragmatic level before setting off in search of the impossible dream."
leo,2011-03-05,"A complicated relationship might implode today, especially if your friend or partner loses his or her temper. Something may be said that surprises you, but being caught off guard isn't the real problem. Even if you believe everything to be stable, you're suddenly realizing that it isn't. Don't let narrow vision trick you into concentrating only on your needs. Keep in mind that taking everyone's perspective into consideration is better than being forced to negotiate later on."
virgo,2011-03-05,"You may feel as if others cannot be trusted today because they just don't seem to care as much about quality as you do. You aren't easy to please, especially if your expectations are unrealistic; nevertheless, you don't believe your ideas are extreme. Allowing for someone else's shortcomings should help everyone to relax. Ironically, this simple act of generosity can improve overall productivity."
libra,2011-03-05,"A bolt of lightning-like awareness may require you to abandon your previously set schedule for this weekend. The flow of events might not make as much sense once circumstances begin to change, so don't even attempt to cling to your old agenda. If you are willing to let it all fall apart, a new sequence of events might be reestablished rather quickly, allowing you to move forward with your plans sooner than you expect."
scorpio,2011-03-05,"It's not always easy for you to take a risk to express what's in your heart. Today, however, the rewards could make your vulnerability worthwhile. The Moon's conjunction with unorthodox Uranus in your 5th House of Play suggests that unconventional action makes good sense. Reach a little past your regular limits, but don't forget to bring your energy back to center at the end of the day."
sagittarius,2011-03-05,"You may be less settled than you appear to others now because you are controlled enough on the outside to fool everyone else into believing that you are unflappable. However, denying your true feelings can backfire today as a touch of fearful self-restraint makes you seem less authentic than usual. Revealing a little vulnerability should work in your favor by reminding your friends that you are human, too."
capricorn,2011-03-05,"It might feel as if everything is working just as it should now, but for some reason you still secretly wonder if things are falling apart. This odd juxtaposition tells the story of what happens when you hide your feelings from those you love. Even if you have a clear view of where you are going now, it's hard to know the best way to reach your destination. Don't let go of your vision of the future. Focusing on your goals can help you find your way when you feel overwhelmed."
aquarius,2011-03-05,"You may feel somewhat unstable today as your self-esteem climbs one moment and then dips the next. It's hard to find solid ground on which to plant your feet, even if you want to build a strong sense of security now. No doubt, this is a time of great transition. Don't try to play it safe by standing in one spot; you'll be happier if you can just float along with your mood swings until they begin to settle on their own."
pisces,2011-03-05,"The current uncertainties continue to make your life extraordinarily challenging these days. You're under pressure to shift your perspective or make a new plan, but you still want to hold on to the past. Don't be concerned if someone is demanding that you declare your intentions today; it's not a good idea to say more than you know. Stick to your truth and make your choice known only once you are ready."
aries,2011-03-06,"Although it's not quite your time of year yet, you can already feel the excitement. Instead of seeing obstacles, you see possibilities. Rather than thinking about the hard work ahead, you are visualizing your destination as if you have already arrived. However, there is a little problem: your current tendency to avoid the more challenging aspects of what's happening can quickly land you in a heap of trouble. Prevent problems by slowing down and thinking before you act."
taurus,2011-03-06,"Although the finish line may be in sight, you know better than to break out in an unrestrained sprint. Fortunately, your tendency to conserve energy is wise, for a trick of light could make your goal appear much closer than it actually is. There's no reason to be discouraged today; just set a pace that you can keep up for a while because the marathon isn't quite over yet."
gemini,2011-03-06,"Someone may be putting you up on a pedestal today, but it's not a good idea to buy into this false superiority. Instead of seeing yourself as top dog, let go of any attachment you might have to exercising authority. You'll be much happier if you are a willing participant in a group activity than if you fight to be in charge. Sharing responsibility now will work out better for all involved."
cancer,2011-03-06,"You may not be happy about being forced out of your shell today, but others are looking to you for guidance and it's wise to share your perspective. Still, you're reluctant to push your ideas onto others and might wish that you didn't have to take on new responsibilities now. Thankfully, your current service will be rewarded if you don't get carried away with your own power."
leo,2011-03-06,"Success will be yours today if you can strike a sensible balance between your grandiose plans and the actual limitations of the current circumstances. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to get so enthused with such big ideas that you end up spreading yourself too thin and falling short of your expectations. Even if you have high hopes, you'll accomplish more by moderating your ambitions. Make quality, not quantity, your primary goal."
virgo,2011-03-06,"Partnerships continue to be a major focus now, but the dynamics of a current relationship could grow more complex as the balance of power begins to shift. You may be so enamored with the potential of working with such an optimistic person that you give up more control than is necessary. Or, perhaps, you are too quick to trust someone who hasn't yet earned your respect. Opportunities abound today, but don't forget to use your common sense when choosing which ones to pursue."
libra,2011-03-06,"Someone may come along today with an intriguing idea and a convincing sales pitch. However, you could be so eager for an adventure that you say yes before you even know all the details. Keep in mind that you are more susceptible now to a story that's built on big dreams and blue sky. Check your facts twice before jumping onto someone else's bandwagon or you might waste time running down a dream that isn't even yours."
scorpio,2011-03-06,"You may have had a recent break from your regular routine. Now, however, you're eager to get back into the swing of things and reestablish a daily regimen. Instead of repeating a pattern of constantly chasing deadlines, look at this time as an opportunity to change the rules of the game so you can get ahead of the curve. You have more power than you realize, and it just may be time to flex your muscles."
sagittarius,2011-03-06,"It's not easy to contain your enthusiasm today as the Moon joins your key planet Jupiter in impulsive Aries. You don't want to wait for the red light to change to green; you're ready to hit the gas pedal right now. Unfortunately, moving too fast can lessen your chances for success. Over the next few weeks you have an incredible opportunity to do something that's significant while also having fun. Push ahead with cautious determination instead of flying by the seat of your pants."
capricorn,2011-03-06,"You have your sights set high today, but the Sun's anxious quincunx to karmic Saturn may raise your concerns about being unprepared for what's ahead. Instead of wishing that you had worked harder in the past or gone further with your schooling, consider what you can do now that will impact your career later on. Just remember that maintaining a positive attitude in the present can help to create the solid foundation required for a stellar future."
aquarius,2011-03-06,"You might not have a lot of downtime today because you're trying to pack so much into your life right now. Unfortunately, you could run into a stone wall if you're not paying attention to how much energy you are expending. Don't wait for a reality check to stop you in your tracks. Slowing down voluntarily not only increases your pleasure in the present moment, it will also help you accomplish more than you thought possible."
pisces,2011-03-06,"You might expect your motivation to lag today because the Moon leaves Pisces very early this morning. However, you are more likely to feel a powerful boost of energy, even if you are faced with a tricky situation. Don't make the mistake of believing that you can overcome an obstacle now by sheer force. Instead, take your time and slowly build on what you've already started."
aries,2011-03-07,"You may not be able to justify playing with your friends today, even after your workday is over. You could have such a large backlog of obligations now that you don't feel finished even after you complete several items on your checklist. However, feeling guilty doesn't serve any real purpose, nor does endlessly explaining your actions to anyone else. Just do as much as humanly possible and then reward yourself by letting go of any lingering concerns that prevent you from enjoying the present moment."
taurus,2011-03-07,"Setting aside some time to relax is essential for your mental health today, because otherwise you could miss your chance for fun. Even if you figure out a sensible schedule in advance, something could happen that forces you to alter your plans. Don't argue with the inevitable; save your energy for more important endeavors."
gemini,2011-03-07,"You would like to present a responsible image today by taking the extra step and turning a creative project into something useful. You might think you know where you're going, but your priorities can change quickly when you are ready for fun. Unfortunately, it doesn't matter how good you are at tap dancing; you still won't be able to sidestep your chores. Chasing the elusive rainbow of pleasure will not bring true satisfaction, so give up your schemes and do what's expected of you for now."
cancer,2011-03-07,"Someone at work might call in a debt today by asking you for a favor. Although it's not acceptable to say no, you may feel annoyed if this obligation interferes with your other plans. It's even more complicated if you cannot easily rearrange your schedule. Normally, setting firm boundaries would be a sensible strategy, but this tactic won't work with the current circumstances. You won't be to able fix everything, but it will probably be sufficient to show your concern and follow through the best you can."
leo,2011-03-07,"It may be a challenging day for you, especially if you are struggling because you're spread too thin. It gets even worse if others are demanding that you take care of everything right away. You could get so angry that you dig in your heels and do nothing at all. Unfortunately, your inflexibility isn't a smart tactic. Don't get discouraged, even if you cannot see a sensible solution now. If you set priorities and take care of the basics first, you'll have time and energy left over to make a bit of magic, too."
virgo,2011-03-07,"You don't want to take responsibility for work that others should be doing. You may even resent someone if you're the only one pulling your fair share. Don't be too quick to jump in and fix other people's mistakes today because you'll only prove that you're obsessed with unrealistic perfection. Instead, just be flexible and honor each person's contribution, no matter how small. Thankfully, you won't likely be so judgmental later in the week."
libra,2011-03-07,"It's no fun being around a controlling person, yet you might be the one who is assuming too much authority today. You don't appreciate it when others act aggressively, so it's a good idea to restrain yourself from doing so, as well. Fortunately, you can lean on your diplomatic skills now; staying aware of your impact on your workmates can ameliorate the tension before it reaches a critical level."
scorpio,2011-03-07,"You may be in touch with a low level anger today that lingers from a recent disagreement with a co-worker. You might want to try a new approach to a routine task, but feel as if others aren't supporting you in your efforts. Nothing will be gained by escalating this difference of opinion into an open conflict. Resolution isn't likely now, so don't force the issue. You will be more successful if you bring it up again in a few days."
sagittarius,2011-03-07,"You may need to get out of the house or escape from the office today in order to feel free. Unfortunately, this can trigger resistance from those who will have to carry the weight in your absence. Don't be so shortsighted that your urgent need for adventure upsets a delicate balance of power. It's better to lean into your restlessness now than to run away from it."
capricorn,2011-03-07,"Your ruling planet Saturn slows you down today, yet it also prevents you from losing focus. Instead of scattering your energy too thin, think twice before acting foolishly. However, assertive Mars is also present, pushing you to take a risk. Finding a balance between caution and recklessness can be tricky business now. Allow your sense of urgency to pass before doing anything drastic; you have more time than you realize."
aquarius,2011-03-07,"You may be feeling a bit subdued now, even if you're still eager to succeed. You might not be able to find an easy solution to a current dilemma, but you can see how taking a gamble isn't necessarily the wisest course of action. Rest assured that the obstacles you are facing are temporary. Hard work won't resolve the problem today; however dogged persistence will eventually help you reach your goals."
pisces,2011-03-07,"You cannot see a direct path to success today, but that's okay because you don't mind zigzagging around as you close in on your destination. You may not even care about the details of where you are going now as long as you have a general idea. Ironically, being too practical will only create additional problems. Keep returning to your initial vision; the specifics will come to you over time."
aries,2011-03-08,"You are a forward-thinking person who is being further encouraged to look ahead by the pioneering Aries Moon. However exciting your dreams may be now, you might need to control your impatience if you feel that you cannot wait. Thankfully, your impulsiveness settles down today, enabling you to enjoy what is unfolding each and every minute. Remember to slow down and smell the coffee instead of just drinking another cup."
taurus,2011-03-08,"You may have been successful recently at keeping yourself out of the action, but that is about to change. The Moon's return to your sign today makes it increasingly difficult to ignore your feelings. The more you attempt to hide something from others, the more obvious your secret will be now. Things will work out better if you try to be as transparent as possible. If asked a question, your straightforward response will bring the best outcome."
gemini,2011-03-08,"You might have a lot on your mind today, making it tough to know where to begin. Be careful, because you could overwhelm someone at work with your anxious sense of urgency. Your perceptions are likely correct, but you could react so quickly that no one knows what to think. A smart strategy now is to take several deep breaths to calm yourself down. Exercising self-restraint allows your emotions to run their course before you say something unnecessarily hurtful."
cancer,2011-03-08,"You are like the mother hen that wants to take care of everyone. You believe you intuitively know what's best for most people and you're not very interested in hearing another point of view now. But your overbearing attitude might inadvertently foment rebellion. Fortunately, avoiding trouble is easy if you pay attention to the mood in the room. Ask others what they want before assuming that you have all the answers."
leo,2011-03-08,"You might be more successful today if you can be a little less intense in your approach. Even if your intentions are honorable, you may realize that your best ideas will be even better if you pare them back a little. Like pruning a garden to produce more fruit, you'll accomplish more once you slow down, steady yourself and move forward with determination. Use your common sense before initiating action so you won't need to make too many adjustments later on."
virgo,2011-03-08,"You experience the world through a highly refined pragmatic lens which helps you to fine-tune your strategy for the rest of the week. You have lots going on now, which can amplify your false sense of urgency. Remember, you really don't have to reach your destination immediately. You'll be more successful if you start slowly today and then pick up the pace in a few days."
libra,2011-03-08,"You can become so set in your ways today that you resist ideas from your co-workers, even if they make a lot of sense. You aren't willing to see someone else's perspective if you believe that your basic needs are being threatened. However, your fear isn't enough of a reason to overcompensate by setting your emotions aside in favor of logic. Your smartest strategy now must include both your heart and your head."
scorpio,2011-03-08,"You have been distracted by abstract thoughts and esoteric interests lately, even if you tried to stay focused on your responsibilities. Now, however, it's time to re-engage with others about more mundane things. Put your emotional needs on the back burner and concentrate on the obvious facts in front of you. Pay attention to the practical areas of your life and leave the hidden secrets of the universe for another day."
sagittarius,2011-03-08,"As the events of the day unfold, you begin to realize that you have some very important work to do. You cannot procrastinate any longer. Hopefully, you've recently had a chance to have fun, enabling you to be ready to concentrate fully on your job. Don't be surprised if it's difficult to motivate yourself now. However, it's crucial to adjust your attitude as necessary and get busy. You cannot afford to waste this opportunity."
capricorn,2011-03-08,"Your co-workers may seek your guidance today because you appear to have your feet firmly planted on the ground. Fortunately, you are eager for a challenge and can demonstrate your ability to assume authority. Although this may be a rather serious phase, there's no reason to lose your sense of humor. You can still be effective, even while having a good time."
aquarius,2011-03-08,"Although you have a lot going on now, you may also be lost in contemplation about money concerns that aren't apparent to others. But idle fantasies are useless unless you're imagining possible scenarios so you can choose the best course to manage the challenges that lie ahead. Don't be afraid of exploring a wide variety of options, for it will be much harder to change your direction once you decide on a plan."
pisces,2011-03-08,"It's disconcerting to tell someone what you are thinking today, even if you immediately know what you feel. You may be fearful of accidentally giving away a secret if you react too quickly. However, holding on to your thoughts could make you seem emotionally detached. Be courageous and push through your fears now because it gets harder to say what's on your mind later."
aries,2011-03-09,"You don't want to wait any longer because your anticipation has changed into impatience by now. Unfortunately, you must acknowledge that the timing for starting something new is less than ideal. You are tempted to continue your planning, while sitting tight for a few more days. Thankfully, your intuition is working well, so follow your instincts and go for it only once you feel ready."
taurus,2011-03-09,"You prefer making your plan and then sticking to it, but now you're more likely to change your mind at the very last minute. You may receive an invitation for a social event that you would normally skip. However, you're eager for a new experience today and might agree to partake in festivities that are outside of your comfort zone. Enjoy the change of pace without feeling the need to justify any of your decisions."
gemini,2011-03-09,"Your key planet Mercury skips into action-packed Aries today, encouraging you to learn everything you can about something new. You might develop an unexpected interest in heading in a different direction. You are eager to start moving, but you could get sidetracked by a major distraction. Instead of losing sight of your previous goals, demonstrate your genius by turning your brilliant ideas into something real."
cancer,2011-03-09,"You may feel anxious today because it's difficult to stop thinking and get back into your emotional comfort zone. There's so much going on internally that you cannot filter through all the noise to hear what's really being said. However, the mental distractions can be a lot of fun if you are willing to playfully draw others into your world. Just be true to yourself while continuing to learn from your experiences as they unfold."
leo,2011-03-09,"You might think that people are acting weird now as they say things without considering the consequences. Your best friends could let you down as their indecisiveness possibly leaves you in a difficult position. There's no need to feel desperate, so don't overreact by losing your temper. It's not wise to take an unnecessary risk now; be smart and focus on becoming self-sufficient, instead."
virgo,2011-03-09,"You have new and exciting methods you want to try today, but a friend or partner might push back now. Some of your brilliant ideas may work fine, but others can just lead you on a wild goose chase. Unfortunately, you might not know if something will work until you test it, which could take quite a bit of time and energy. But you don't need to invent a better mouse trap or light bulb, for you can feel fulfilled by simply being more unorthodox in your approach."
libra,2011-03-09,"You don't want any discord today, but believing that everything is beautiful could leave you detached from reality. It may appear that everyone is having a lovely time, but this isn't the whole picture now as anger or even resentment lurks beneath the tranquil surface. It might be your turn to stir things up for a change. Don't be afraid to express what you're thinking. There's no reason to say everything the same way you did yesterday."
scorpio,2011-03-09,"Today you are able to get back to the research that you recently set aside. Your mind is a sharply honed razor now and your intuition works like sonar. But don't settle for traditional methods to locate the information you seek. Trust your inner voice, but don't overreact to what you learn. No matter how extraordinary it is, you'll gain a clearer perspective on your future over the days ahead."
sagittarius,2011-03-09,"Others usually want to play with you because they know that you are always up for an adventure. Although you are looking forward to having a good time, you may find it difficult now to kick back and relax because high-frequency static is crackling across your senses today. It's not easy to let down your guard if you are also worrying about more serious global issues. Moderate your intensity by balancing the political picture with your individual needs."
capricorn,2011-03-09,"You know that something really big is going on, yet you're distracted today by weird ideas that you cannot get out of your head. It's easy to fall into an obsessive pattern by fighting against the stream of unorthodox ideas that are now flowing from your subconscious mind. But resistance to this natural expression is futile; going against the grain will only make the noise grow louder. It's smarter to ride the intellectual currents, even if you are afraid of being too impractical."
aquarius,2011-03-09,"You are a fount of original ideas because your key planet Uranus connects with quicksilver Mercury today. Your thoughts are exploding into consciousness so fast that you may not be able to keep up with yourself. Don't worry if you have lots of loose ends by the end of the day, since you'll have more time next week to finish what you started."
pisces,2011-03-09,"The ingenious Mercury-Uranus conjunction is in your sign today, but it may be hard for you to make practical use of your current brilliance. Nevertheless, the new ideas can wake you up in such a way that you see things in an entirely different light. However, don't expect others to rush in and support your unconventional plans right away. Instead, give it time; your friends will come around to appreciate your point of view."
aries,2011-03-10,"You are feeling pretty good about yourself now, but someone might say something that tugs on your conscience. Although you may not have any reason to feel guilty, you dislike being misunderstood. Naturally, you want to clarify your position before moving on. Don't put this off; attend to any unresolved issue as quickly as you can, so you are ready for the crazy times ahead."
taurus,2011-03-10,"The Moon is in your sign, strengthening your feelings and raising your spirits. Additionally, your key planet Venus is receiving an energetic boost from optimistic Jupiter, encouraging you to feel even better about yourself and those you love. This is no time to be stubborn; accept recognition and support from others, even if you didn't ask for it. It's your turn to shine."
gemini,2011-03-10,"You might feel as if you're on a roll now. Or, perhaps, it seems like you should be getting ready for something really big. You can feel the changes coming, even if you're still trying to hold yourself back. However, it's not smart to focus on your worries or fears. Today's thoughts shape tomorrow, so visualize the amazing opportunities in front of you. Tie up any loose ends from your past because you don't want anything to get in the way of your future."
cancer,2011-03-10,"Even if your life seems to be unfolding as planned, you still aren't sure that you should trust the good news. Although you don't want to be hurt by what you discover now, you might overcompensate today by gathering all the information you can find. Unfortunately, you don't need any more data; just make a choice and then take a few healthy steps in the direction you want to go."
leo,2011-03-10,"Others come to your rescue just in the nick of time, even if you committed to more than you can deliver. Fortunately, they are bringing you more than just good news; your friends and co-workers are also willing to volunteer a fair amount of hard work. Don't be greedy about potential profit or recognition since it's karmically crucial to share the rewards with anyone who contributes to your success."
virgo,2011-03-10,"You feel like you're losing control of your life today, even if you worked hard to put everything in order. It sounds like it's a smart idea to prioritize your goals and then make a list of the steps needed to reach them. Unfortunately, your plans aren't all that useful now because so much appears to be occurring at once and there's no time for detailed analysis. Let go and trust your intuition; acting on your feelings will bring you as much success as any other strategy now."
libra,2011-03-10,"You are able to see the beauty in everyone today as aesthetically pleasing Venus harmonizes with lucky Jupiter in your 7th House of Partners. You might receive a raise or find pleasure in love. Your optimism is increasing now, along with your income potential. Don't get greedy and expect too much. Nevertheless, rest assured that the winds of change are blowing in a positive direction."
scorpio,2011-03-10,"If you overreact to someone today, you could miss an opportunity to share an amazing experience with a close friend. There is little doubt that this is a strange day, but your apprehension need not detract from the beauty that you perceive around you now. Instead of looking for depth and intensity, keep it light and easy so you can relax and enjoy yourself."
sagittarius,2011-03-10,"You might be extra busy today, especially if you have lots of loose ends to tie up prior to going out and having fun. It doesn't matter if you need to return to work afterward; you still should be able to make time to play later in the afternoon or evening. However, don't procrastinate; it's best to get the hardest jobs out of the way at the beginning of the day."
capricorn,2011-03-10,"Lucky Jupiter harmonizes with Venus in your 2nd House of Money today. You could be up for a raise or, perhaps, you simply receive an appreciative ""thank you"" from someone at work. Naturally, cash would be better, but acknowledgment from your boss is a good deal, too. However, you need to accept the fact that your contribution is of value. Don't be shy; too much doubt can cause you to miss a chance for dramatic change in your life."
aquarius,2011-03-10,"You believe you are right on target today, yet your optimism may seem overwhelming to everyone else. Although you are the epitome of the power of positive thinking now, someone may try to rain on your parade. There's no need to give away your power. Being sensitive in your approach enables you to make room for others who are struggling to hold their position, too."
pisces,2011-03-10,"You may be lost in a hazy dream world and it's a good idea to pinch yourself a few times today just to ascertain that you are actually awake. Although you probably have good cause for optimism, it's important to maintain a sense of reality or you might set yourself up for disappointment later on. Avoiding extremes can be a difficult task unless you have someone in your life that you trust enough to use as a sounding board. But if you ask for feedback, make sure you listen to it."
aries,2011-03-11,"The entry of radical Uranus into your sign today can start a process that takes years to play on through, bringing many exciting changes into your life. You have much to gain from setting long-term goals, but need to temper your plans with flexibility. Although you may feel as if you cannot miss your target now, you could become a victim of your own overconfidence. Doing your homework will help to ensure your preparedness for the shift ahead."
taurus,2011-03-11,"You may feel off-kilter today, even if everything is going well. It's as if a voice in the back of your head is telling you that the ground you walk on isn't as stable as you think it is. Instead of pretending that nothing will ever change, accept the fact that you might have to do a bit of fast thinking to respond to unexpected events. Talking about your fears lessens their hold on your future."
gemini,2011-03-11,"It can be very exciting when the floodgates of your imagination open wide. The Moon's return to your sign increases your mental agility while freeing you from the need to be practical. Although your fantasies might be so vivid that you think they're real, it's crucial to keep your feet on the ground. If you aren't sure whether or not a particular dream is worth pursuing, bring your focus back to the present moment and leave the future for another day."
cancer,2011-03-11,"It's as if there's no room for your emotions now as you communicate with others at work. Something's gnawing at you today, but no one seems to have time to discuss anything that isn't relevant to what's happening in the present moment. Meanwhile, you're feeling more like a beached Crab every minute. Don't worry too much; you'll be nurtured by the surge of fresh tidal waters in a couple of days when the Moon returns to your sign."
leo,2011-03-11,"You are receiving glimpses of a possible future that is very different from the one you previously imagined. However, it's too soon to know exactly what this fuzzy vision will become as you gain clarity about your plans. One thing is for certain: you aren't as stuck as you thought you were. There's no need to push against any resistance you may be feeling; it will dissipate as your new goals come into focus."
virgo,2011-03-11,There is a subtle shift in your relationship life now that pulls you into deeper waters. It's not enough to establish harmony between you and someone else; you also want the excitement that comes from exploring new territory. You may need to set aside your analytical approach and jump into the flowing emotional waters of change. Talking about your fears can rejuvenate an important partnership.
libra,2011-03-11,"You may need to revise your plans now because someone's unexpected behavior makes you feel uncertain about your future. However, it's a mistake to blame anyone else for your current insecurity. If you are repressing your need for change, it could appear as another person's shocking action. As you begin to accept your own radical streak, others will have less impact on your happiness."
scorpio,2011-03-11,"You are facing a significant turning point as you are being forced to let go of your assumptions about your daily routine. Wherever your life has become too mechanized, lightning can strike and infuse new energy back into it. If you are flexible, this can be quite exciting; however, if you are fearful of change, this can be upsetting. Letting go of the past will help you be more fulfilled in the future."
sagittarius,2011-03-11,"A new wave of enthusiasm washes over you, and it could make you feel so excited that you don't quite know what to do with yourself. The most important thing now is to consider what you want in the future, rather than seeking immediate gratification. Impulsive behavior might be thrilling in the moment, but it won't help you in the long run."
capricorn,2011-03-11,"You may be feeling quite optimistic about your family or about the potential of change at home. However, things seem to be moving much faster now and you can't help but nostalgically long for the simpler times of the past. Unfortunately, there's no going back. Thankfully, you'll feel better once you shift gears and realize that you're able to keep up with everything as it unfolds."
aquarius,2011-03-11,"Your key planet Uranus blasts into impulsive Aries today, opening your mind to think about all the things you previously thought you couldn't do. Now, however, the impossible doesn't seem unattainable at all. Naturally, you won't be able to drop all your responsibilities and suddenly shift everything in your life. Nevertheless, entertaining the improbable can bring opportunities you don't expect."
pisces,2011-03-11,"You may have recently made a financial decision that now comes back up for reconsideration. Even if you thought your choice was final, it's still possible to change your mind. However, it's not a smart idea to shift directions today. Instead, think about all the ramifications of your current assumptions about money while committing to staying flexible until your goals become firm."
aries,2011-03-12,"You may be scattered now, yet you can still get a lot accomplished if you focus on the most important tasks. Unfortunately, every thought you have seems like a good one, so it's difficult to complete one thing before running off to begin something else. Naturally, this is a familiar theme for you spontaneous Rams. Take control of your restlessness today by committing to finish whatever you start."
taurus,2011-03-12,"You really want to talk about a recent spiritual experience or share a dream with someone special. Once you get started, though, you'll probably say more than you initially intended. Ironically, you could use a whole lot of words now, even if you don't tell your whole story. Leaving out a significant piece of information is one way to avoid the truth. There's nothing wrong with this strategy if you promised to keep a secret for someone; however intentional forgetfulness will lead to trouble."
gemini,2011-03-12,"You are more responsive to others at work now that the Moon is back in your sign, but your co-workers may not understand what you are saying. It isn't that your words aren't clear; it's just that your moods seem to change so quickly that you're already feeling something new by the time you begin to describe an emotion. Remember that no one needs to know about every single whim that passes through your mind."
cancer,2011-03-12,"Your thoughts are racing so fast that it's difficult to know where to jump in today. Your fantasy life is very complicated and it feels like it would take too much explaining to share even a simple idea. Accordingly, you might know what's going on, but still may choose to remain silent now. Don't try to talk yet; if you aren't ready, there's always tomorrow."
leo,2011-03-12,"It's easy to appear transparent to your friends now, but there's still more happening than meets the eye. It's not that you are hiding anything; it's just that your words don't quite describe your feelings, which can be based upon a metaphysical concept that is difficult to explain. Everyone seems to like that you're putting in extra work, yet it's the projects that endure over the long run that truly count."
virgo,2011-03-12,"You don't want to reveal your feelings because you're afraid that someone will see how scattered you are now. While it's true that the restless Gemini Moon could have you bouncing off the walls, you aren't nearly as wired as you were earlier. Although you aren't likely to accomplish as much as you want, you aren't as unfocused as you think. Keep bringing your attention back to current responsibilities, rather than losing yourself in too much data."
libra,2011-03-12,"Just because you can mentally escape from your current struggles, this doesn't mean that you should dismiss the source of your current tension. The Moon is in your 9th House of Exotic Travel today, indicating that distant goals are the most attractive while also being the subject of your fantasies. Your dreams may be rather convincing, but real satisfaction requires you to work things out closer to home."
scorpio,2011-03-12,"Sometimes, a complex set of issues are best handled with a simple solution. Forget about the allure of unconventional emotional entanglements and set aside the intriguing possibilities of interactions that will never be. Steer clear of any drama that doesn't directly concern you. Although you are tempted to spin tall tales today, you're wise to keep things uncomplicated."
sagittarius,2011-03-12,"You are alternately pulled between being serious and silly today since the emotional climate can change on a moment's notice. Both extremes make perfect sense, but only one at a time. The best tactic now is to stay flexible while responding to the current situation. Keep in mind that your moods are more dependent than usual on those around you."
capricorn,2011-03-12,"Your need to plod through all the information at work could test the patience of everyone around you today. This can create a rather delicate situation, especially if others usually depend upon you. It isn't that you have become less reliable; it's just that you could take on more than you can finish. The smartest way to avoid problems is to set boundaries early on so you don't set up unrealistic expectations."
aquarius,2011-03-12,"Dealing with your own sense of disappointment can be challenging, especially if you must face several obstacles today. Fortunately, your hope returns quickly and you know that things will get better. Your buoyant attitude could change a very difficult situation into an opportunity that ultimately works in your favor. Even if you can't control what happens to you, you are the only one responsible for deciding how to respond."
pisces,2011-03-12,"Your sweet and tender heart encourages you to help others less fortunate today, but you are also required to respond in a more contained manner. However, your current compassion might quickly lead you astray and provide your boss with easy ammunition. Although you may recognize that you did something wrong, it's more important to resolve to work harder now than it is to harbor unproductive feelings of guilt later on."
aries,2011-03-13,"There is a finite limit to your seemingly bottomless well of vitality. You may be running on empty now because it's unlikely that you conserved any energy over the past few days. Don't pretend that you can continue to carry on without any worries. Instead of waiting until you hit a wall, get some rest today. There's no excuse to procrastinate when it comes to taking care of yourself."
taurus,2011-03-13,"Your big ideas could create problems today if you have overextended your reach. You might feel desperate, thinking that an increased effort could compensate for poor planning. Being realistic can save you a serious headache down the road. If your strategy isn't working, abandon it and try something else. It's better to shift your focus than to set yourself up for failure."
gemini,2011-03-13,"Although you are usually able to play well with others, good intentions won't be sufficient because your key planet Mercury is having a hard time with domineering Pluto. Today's Mercury-Pluto square could provoke a social meltdown if you are pushed too far by circumstances. Instead of being clever, your current message is ""don't mess with me."" Thankfully, most everyone will listen to what you're saying now because your delivery is very convincing."
cancer,2011-03-13,"It is easier for you to express your feelings now that the Moon has returned to your sign. Unfortunately, you may need to stand up to a very powerful person today, even if you prefer to remain silent. You might be required to take a leap of faith to start up a difficult conversation, but once you begin, it gets much easier. Don't be afraid of your truth because it's your turn to shine."
leo,2011-03-13,"It's difficult for you to find the confidence you need to make progress today, for everyone is not on your side now. But don't let self-doubt sap your energy, even if someone appears to be working against you. It's tempting to engage in conflict, especially if it gives you a chance to bring a secret out into the open. However, it may be wiser to just focus on love than to feed into any other person's negativity."
virgo,2011-03-13,"Your ruling planet Mercury creates a dynamic square with overbearing Pluto today, raising the existing stakes on a disagreement. You are tempted to pull out all the stops and tell your current nemesis exactly what you think, but this won't likely lead to a solution. It's smarter to take the moral high road without stressing over the present battle. Reaching an altruistic goal is more important than fighting over something that won't ultimately matter."
libra,2011-03-13,"The single most sensible thing you can do now is to listen to your heart instead of your head. Unfortunately, this tactic can produce stress that comes from other people's lack of sensitivity when criticizing your choices. However, engaging in an unpleasant conversation shouldn't be very difficult if you aren't worrying about the negative consequences and can concentrate on the positive possibilities, instead."
scorpio,2011-03-13,"Your key planet Pluto symbolizes the intensity of feelings within the shadows of your subconscious mind. Today, a square to Pluto from messenger Mercury shines the light on an undeniable fact. Perhaps someone will ask you a tough question that sends you on a journey within. Don't avoid the difficult issues; make time for an important conversation because you'll feel a lot better after a well-kept secret is out in the open."
sagittarius,2011-03-13,"If you have been less optimistic than usual, today still may be full of fruitful progress. Although you may not have an epiphany in a sudden flash of illumination, you should be able to see a facet of yourself that's previously been hidden from view. Don't casually brush aside what you don't want to hear; the truth can spark a deep-seated change and ultimately free you from unnecessary self-limitations."
capricorn,2011-03-13,"A long-lasting and dramatic metamorphosis that has already started will transform the direction of your life. Pluto's creative square to logical Mercury highlights one of the many issues you must face. Someone might upset you when saying something casually, pushing an emotional button which causes you to escalate a minor disagreement into a significant conflict. Thankfully, there's a different response. You don't need to succumb to negativity; create a plan based on love instead of fear."
aquarius,2011-03-13,"There can be security derived from what isn't said between friends, but you may have reached your limit with keeping quiet. You might speak your mind today without concern for what will follow, even if you haven't yet considered all the consequences. Don't worry if a simple discussion becomes heated. Stick with it and the emotions should settle back down, leaving the relationship better off because of your efforts."
pisces,2011-03-13,"Your long-term goals aren't immune to change just because you think that you know where you are heading. A re-evaluation of your core beliefs could initiate a fundamental shift in the direction of your life path. There's no way around it; as your values morph, you will need to reconsider your dreams about the future."
aries,2011-03-14,"It's hard to please others today. One voice yells go while another shouts stop. Your key planet, impulsive Mars, runs into Saturn's obstacles and there seems to be no way to break through the resistance you are experiencing. If you push too hard, you'll wish you didn't. But if you don't try at all, you'll wish you did. Steer clear of extremes as you work the gas pedal and the brake to stay within the speed limit."
taurus,2011-03-14,"You are known to get very stubborn when you're pushed in ways you don't like. It may feel as if things at work are changing too fast today for your tastes, but it's futile to hold on to the present. The more rigid you become now, the harder it will be to get comfortable in the midst of so much stress. Don't try to fix everything; seek pleasure in the small things you can actually manage."
gemini,2011-03-14,"Your current responsibilities may be stressing you out today because you feel shortchanged in your pursuit of pleasure. Although you realize that you'll need to complete your work before you can kick back and put your feet up, you resent having to wait. Concentrate on what you must do in the immediate moment; the future will arrive soon enough."
cancer,2011-03-14,"You aren't eager to forge ahead with a current assignment; you would prefer to take your time while developing your strategy. Unfortunately, you may not have the luxury of biding your time; deadlines are looming and the clock doesn't stop ticking just because you want to move slower. Try not to get distracted by your preferences today; instead, show up and perform your expected tasks to the best of your ability."
leo,2011-03-14,"Although you thought you were on track, you may not be able to grasp all the nuances of power politics today. Unfortunately, you could run headlong into an emotional landmine that forces you to reconsider your course of action. It may feel as if someone is working at cross-purposes now, but it's more likely that your goals seem so different because you have such divergent approaches. Seek common ground in the present moment instead of trying to integrate your plans for the future."
virgo,2011-03-14,"You are more comfortable putting all the details in order before jumping into a project. Unfortunately, you might not have that luxury today as someone demands that you take action now and not later. But your perceived sense of urgency may not actually be a true reflection of what's happening. Instead of trying to look like a hero by rushing to meet other people's expectations, trust your own instincts. It's better to do the job right the first time around."
libra,2011-03-14,"Everyone has his or her idea of what you should be doing now, but no one is asking you what you want to do. Although others might appreciate you meeting their demands, acknowledging your own needs is probably more important. It may seem as if there's no simple way to resolve the current stress, but you can minimize your frustration by shifting your focus away from your long-term goals and limit your planning to only today."
scorpio,2011-03-14,"Instead of attempting to convince others that your plan is a solid one today, spend time examining your weaknesses to understand how they may be forcing you to overcompensate. Rather than focusing on your own progress, see what you can learn from others without trying to one-up them. Although you are willing to jump into the fray again, remember that coming out ahead is less important than turning every moment into another chapter in your journey of self-discovery."
sagittarius,2011-03-14,"You might wish that your path to the future is smooth and clear, but it seems that others are obstructing your progress now. It's difficult for you to be a part of a group effort, even if you are eager to cooperate with everyone else. Unfortunately, more is being asked of you than you can reasonably deliver. But retreating into the safety of your own private world is not your smartest solution. Exploring your feelings about getting lost in a cause that is greater than you is the first step to deciding on your next destination."
capricorn,2011-03-14,"You are willing to endure hardships and austerity if you know that a big payoff might be yours later on. Your patience usually works in your favor, but now impulsive Mars is pushing for action. Immediate resolution isn't likely and unfortunately, nothing you can do now will help you claim your reward any faster. Lessen your frustration by temporarily suspending your need to do something new while concentrating on what you can change, instead."
aquarius,2011-03-14,"You are a bit agitated today because you know what you want but don't know exactly how to get it. Magnetic Venus is anxiously aspecting erratic Uranus, heightening your desires while also drawing you to avant garde people who entice you to engage in risky behavior. Don't worry if you are without a coherent plan; just avoid unnecessary temptations. Even if you don't succeed now, remember that acting with caution will pay off in the long run."
pisces,2011-03-14,"You are feeling your oats today, but that doesn't mean you'll get what you want. Part of the problem is that you may be asking for the wrong things now, setting yourself up for failure before you even start. Thankfully, your sense of timing improves throughout the day. What starts off as a blunder turns into a firm resolve to do the right thing. Your sheer determination greatly improves your chances for success."
aries,2011-03-15,"If you have been on an energetic high recently, today you may kick the action up a notch when the Moon enters fiery Leo. However, if you experience a bit of a slump early in the day, you might try to overcompensate for it later by exaggerating everything you say. Unfortunately, talking big will only set you up for a fall, so avoid temptations and don't make promises you can't keep."
taurus,2011-03-15,"If your friends can't figure out what you are doing today, then they won't be able to criticize you. You can confuse them by not saying very much one minute and then going on and on about nothing in particular the next minute. Unfortunately, this could alienate your biggest supporters. Instead, moderate any extreme reactions while still using the power of your vision to motivate others."
gemini,2011-03-15,"Philosophizing about your future may be an enjoyable diversion today, but don't be discouraged if your talking doesn't lead to anything tangible. Whether or not your ideas are practical is not important now. Stretching your mind by thinking out loud can lead to interesting discussions, but it's useful to understand the difference between idle chatter and constructive conversation."
cancer,2011-03-15,"You may be exceptionally verbose today and thankfully, the power of positive thinking could heal an emotional wound. But it's not a good idea to assume that you can fix anything. It's better to acknowledge your limitations so you don't let your friends and co-workers down. Remaining humble will increase the possibility of being able to help those who really need it."
leo,2011-03-15,"The Moon's return to your sign allows you to be empathetic enough that you can sense what others are feeling. Unfortunately, other people's plans don't seem to conform to yours, making it easy to get into an argument. But the differences may be greater in your mind than they are in reality. Instead of allowing a disagreement to escalate, it's smarter to accept whatever support you receive. If criticism arises, be thankful for the feedback and then do what feels right."
virgo,2011-03-15,"Your ruling planet Mercury conjuncts grandiose Jupiter, mischievously turning every little thought into a long treatise. It may not be easy to keep your ideas in perspective or your words to a minimum. Unintentionally, you can turn the simplest task into a complicated project that becomes very inefficient. Your day doesn't have to run out of control if you remember to keep bringing your message back down to earth."
libra,2011-03-15,"You may feel brilliant today as your original ideas flow into the light of creation. It's easy to communicate because others seem to be encouraging you to say even more. However, you need to be on guard, for you could become overly opinionated, making people take you less seriously. Fortunately, active listening can prevent you from flying off the rails and can improve your chances for success."
scorpio,2011-03-15,"Memories from the past may be stimulated by someone at work today, but your recollections may be quite different than they were before. Logical Mercury's conjunction with optimistic Jupiter paints your thoughts with brighter colors which enable you to see positive aspects to nearly everything. Getting to the truth isn't as important as you think, so don't be afraid of adding a new twist to an old story."
sagittarius,2011-03-15,"You are on a creative roll today, but it's wise not to get so carried away with what you are doing that you lose touch with reality. If you do take your ideas too far now, you could run into trouble soon enough as you encounter a logistical nightmare. It's okay to push a little further than you usually do, but some caution is advised. Don't spread yourself too thin or you'll end up accomplishing less than you want."
capricorn,2011-03-15,"You may be feeling very upbeat about yourself and your family today, but too much self-confidence could lead to trouble if you forget to pay careful attention to your feelings. Instead of focusing on your goals and denying that anything is wrong, be courageous enough to show your vulnerabilities. Once you accept your humanly shortcomings without falling into self-doubt, you'll be better equipped to find true happiness."
aquarius,2011-03-15,"If you think that you have all the answers to the questions of life, you'll quickly discover today that you don't. Although you may be riding high on your own enthusiasm, you are still missing a lot of information. There is a big difference between knowing the facts and maintaining a clear vision of your future. Leaving room for improvement is a better strategy than pretending that you have it all figured out."
pisces,2011-03-15,"You might believe that you are being realistic today, but it's tough to remain grounded while Mercury the Messenger joins your key planet, visionary Jupiter. Your mind races along and your words cannot keep up with your outrageous ideas. You want to connect with others in a very real way, but it's hard to fit everything into a simple sentence. Instead of trying to say it all, keep some of your experiences to yourself and pay attention to where your imagination carries you."
aries,2011-03-16,"Someone who knows you very well may be pushing your emotional buttons today. Of course, your wisest move is to look the other way so you can sidestep any interaction that could erupt into an unpleasant encounter, but you probably won't be able to hide your annoyance. Luckily, you should be able to turn this difficult situation around by transforming your anger into compassion. A little love and understanding will go a long way now toward making everyone happy."
taurus,2011-03-16,"You may get a feeling, as if it's time to set the record straight. You are even ready for a confrontation, if necessary, but everyone seems to mellow as the day draws on. Be willing to set aside logic and simply ride the emotional waves that originate from within your subconscious mind. Although the relentless Leo Moon's ambition can be scary, sharing an intimate experience can help you overcome your fears."
gemini,2011-03-16,"Being sure of what you want is one thing, but becoming overly attached to any particular outcome is likely to bring unhappiness. You have a special opportunity now to push past an associate's judgment that's been bringing you down. More importantly, you have the ability to use the power of positive thinking to turn a potentially obsessive approach into one that's certainly more manageable."
cancer,2011-03-16,"The Leo Moon increases your ability to remain steadfast today, motivating you to be very loyal in love. Nevertheless, your current resistance to change may grow into an obstacle to intimacy. It's risky to reveal your feelings, so you might just let the present moment pass without saying anything at all. Now, however, you have a chance to change an old pattern. Start tentatively, but stay focused on what is in your heart. Ultimately, your willingness to share your vulnerability can deepen your connection with someone you love."
leo,2011-03-16,"You are able to feel the magic today, but a dynamic change in a relationship won't likely happen until you're willing to listen to your partner and receive the very same love you so easily give. Keep in mind that everything cannot always be fun. You're intelligent enough to understand that opening your heart to love also means opening it to heartache. Fortunately, a highly charged emotional interaction can morph into a more comfortable one later on."
virgo,2011-03-16,"Today runs more smoothly if you remember to let the tension build until it reaches a critical mass on its own. However, you may try to shake things up to catalyze an unstable situation. But don't push your luck by demanding that everyone stops and pays attention to you. Paradoxically, intentional avoidance of a tough issue can be just as dangerous as attempting to express it. Allow feelings to surface naturally without judging any of them as right or wrong."
libra,2011-03-16,"You may be worn out from following the dramas of your friends and associates, yet somehow their stories have also become yours. It isn't a simple task to separate yourself from all the interpersonal relationships that require your time and attention. Although your stress may not be easily resolved, there's movement that brings you closer to an answer today. Don't try to figure out everything on your own. Leaning on a trusted friend can help just enough to move things off of dead center."
scorpio,2011-03-16,"You cannot escape from your powerful feelings today, even if it's not easy integrating them into your day. Although it's healthy to share what you want with someone you trust, it's unfair to make him or her responsible to deliver your satisfaction. Staying somewhat detached from the outcome creates enough sacred space for an original solution to magically unfold."
sagittarius,2011-03-16,"You might assume that you can get your needs met without having to consider the consequences of your actions. However, you may be temporarily stuck in a tidal pool now, where everything you do has immediate ramifications. Thankfully, you can make informed choices that lead you to a fair compromise. However, you should be prepared to work harder than ever if you want to do the right thing."
capricorn,2011-03-16,"You might attempt to resist the pressure to explore your feelings today, for this seems like a lot of work without much benefit in return. Unfortunately, your desire to hold on to the status quo could cost you dearly because of a lost opportunity. However, the real reward won't likely be money or recognition. The good news is that you have a chance to experience spiritual growth, which can bring a kind of happiness that money cannot buy."
aquarius,2011-03-16,"Having a simple discussion with a friend or partner today can unleash unexpected torrents of emotional content. Although this conversation may be constructive, it's easy to slip into disagreement over your divergent needs. Extra attention, combined with awareness, helps you understand that you can have strong opposing perspectives while still supporting each other's dreams. This mutual appreciation can reveal a treasure that will deepen your relationship."
pisces,2011-03-16,"Although it's hard to understand the forces that brought you to this very moment, you're very clear about what you want next. Unfortunately, circumstances may not be very forgiving now, offering you less leeway to respond to a tricky situation at work. Thankfully, you can make things easier on yourself by acknowledging your willingness to wait for satisfaction. Your patience is the key to ultimately getting what you want."
aries,2011-03-17,"Even the best times must come to an end. The party is over and now you must be serious about the work in front of you. But if you've been putting off the inevitable, today the window of procrastination can slam painfully on your fingers. There's no need to be over-controlling now. The time for making excuses has passed. Stop talking and get started without further delay."
taurus,2011-03-17,"You may be relieved by the change of attitude in your friends and co-workers today, for there seems to be a trend toward more self-discipline. This makes it easier for you to be serious about your job without feeling out of place. Ask for the help you need to be more efficient, for others will probably be glad to offer their assistance now."
gemini,2011-03-17,"You are conflicted today because you know that it would be wise to turn down a social offer so you can concentrate on your work. However, it isn't easy to say no, especially if you have an opportunity to be with your friends. Unfortunately, you won't have much latitude now and responsibility must win out over frivolity. You'll be able to return to the fun and games on another day once your work is done."
cancer,2011-03-17,"You need to share your needs with those in your immediate environment today as the Moon enters your 3rd House of Communication. But be careful, because you are tempted to become overly attached to the people you encounter as you carry out your job. Instead, maintain a high level of professional conduct in all your interactions. Everyone will be happier if you respect boundaries and give your co-workers the distance that they need."
leo,2011-03-17,"You may breathe easier today when the Moon leaves your sign to enter your 2nd House of Self Worth. You might not feel as emotional, so there are fewer distractions to prevent you from taking what you've started and moving it into the next phase. For example, adding stability to a new idea now is more valuable than coming up with a completely different approach. You have already taken your first step. Take as many as you need until you find your own rhythm."
virgo,2011-03-17,"The Moon's entry into hardworking Virgo is an excellent opportunity to demonstrate your commitment to your co-workers. But this is not about signing a contract or walking on a tightrope stretched between your old world and what awaits you in your future. This is about making your appearance in the present moment and remaining open to whatever happens. Once you shake your false sense of urgency, you'll be free to find new ways to express yourself."
libra,2011-03-17,"Your life has increased in complexity, yet your faster pace doesn't bring you any closer to satisfaction. The elusive bluebird of happiness may be avoiding your windowsill for a reason today. But it's not about anything you did, nor is it a sign of upcoming bad luck. If you change your attitude to a more positive outlook, you'll be amazed at how quickly you can put your life in order."
scorpio,2011-03-17,"You may be more careful than usual about choosing your friends today, but making important decisions is easier to do without stressing over them. Even if you decide to pass on a social gathering, it's no big deal for you to simply send along your regrets. There's no need to worry endlessly about what others think. For now, it's crucial to follow your own path without waiting for anyone else's approval."
sagittarius,2011-03-17,"There are specific tasks you must do today, whether you want to or not. The upside is that this can be a learning process for you because you can't allow your needs to overshadow your place in the social network. But it may sadden you to realize that some of your peers don't want to know anything about you; they only want you to do your job. The good news is that you'll still get to go off on your own sweet adventure; just make sure to meet your obligations first."
capricorn,2011-03-17,"Your inner self may not be aligned with your outer self today, leaving you with a lack of motivation. Normally, your ambitions are strong, but now it may be too much work to manage the details that could help you get through the day. Take control of your schedule by reserving the right to say no to anything new. Clearly let others know that you can only do so much at one time if you are to do it well."
aquarius,2011-03-17,"Today's Moon in your 8th House of Shared Resources can tie your finances to others. But things are not so simple now and complex relationships can have a big impact on your work. Thankfully, you are ahead of the pack if you already realize that you can't do everything alone. When you join forces with someone else, the combined power can be unstoppable, so don't be afraid of giving up some control to be a part of a group process."
pisces,2011-03-17,"The picky Virgo Moon enters your 7th House of Partners today, helping you compile a list of the flaws of your spouse, lover or closest friend. But you may be so critical that no one could possibly meet all your standards. Be gentle when evaluating others, since the issue isn't really about them at all. It's about your feelings and how you judge yourself. Keep in mind that the harsh criteria you are now using may be more of a hindrance than a help. If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
aries,2011-03-18,"Mercury the Messenger's opposition to Saturn in your 7th House of Others could mean that your friends aren't very supportive of your new plans. You might feel as if you're running into walls every way you turn today because your current approach doesn't seem to be quite good enough. Don't try to fast-talk your way through the resistance you face. Instead, retreat and take time to improve your ideas before trying again."
taurus,2011-03-18,"Ironically, you might participate in recreational play out of obligation today, rather than from your desire for pleasure. Unfortunately, this kind of escape from work won't be worth it, especially if you are only stepping through the motions. Don't let others talk you into any extracurricular activities now unless they bring you joy. Say no politely; everyone will surely understand if you need some time to yourself."
gemini,2011-03-18,"It's just plain annoying if someone arrives at your doorstep today with an opportunity that looks too good to be true -- because it probably is. Unfortunately, progress is painstakingly slow and nothing much will happen unless you put in the extra work. However, your efforts are thwarted as your key planet Mercury forms an opposition with authoritative Saturn. It's crucial to bring problems out into the open, so they can be handled once and for all."
cancer,2011-03-18,"Although you have been more assertive lately, caution sets in now as you attempt to reestablish balance in your life. Still, you can impress others with a good show today. But shortcuts won't be rewarded; it's more important to start at the beginning and do each step in the proper order. It's futile to worry about deadlines because everything takes more time than you think anyway."
leo,2011-03-18,"You could suffer a setback if something unexpected has recently occurred. You might require a quick refresher course in how to maintain a healthy level of confidence. But it's not easy to talk with others about what you are doing today. Don't shy away from putting in some long hours and hard work. Change won't come easily, but it's worth the effort if you really want to make a difference."
virgo,2011-03-18,"Your ruling planet Mercury runs into the resistance of Saturn the Tester today. Mercury is the clever messenger planet, yet it doesn't like being delayed by stern Saturn. But it's impossible to circumvent authority now, so you must deal with control issues, whether you like it or not. Talking fast and using brute force won't get you where you need to be. Honest dialogue, however, can set the stage for healthy compromise."
libra,2011-03-18,"Relationships are hard enough, yet an interaction with a friend or partner can make the dynamics even more complicated. You may be vying for control now that you're aware of the differences of opinion. Don't push for resolution today because that could lead to an emotional meltdown. Just be as clear as possible, communicate carefully and then let it go."
scorpio,2011-03-18,"You are a serious thinker and may be the one who is eager to engage in a discussion about a complex emotional situation when others are not. Don't push too hard today or you might alienate the very same people you are trying to approach for support. Think twice before making a beeline to the most intense topic possible. Instead, allow a discussion to meander for a while without trying to control the outcome."
sagittarius,2011-03-18,"You aren't happy being told no, and yet you might have to acquiesce to an authority who wrests control from you today. You're tempted to take a stand by pretending to be more informed than you actually are now. Unfortunately, this tactic will likely create more trouble than it's worth. Save time for everyone by just being completely honest in the first place."
capricorn,2011-03-18,"You could be struck with a panic attack today because time is running out and you have many loose ends to tie up. Unfortunately, some things will need to be left undone. It's easier if you set your priorities early in the day and then stick to your plan because changing your schedule isn't something you do lightly. Nevertheless, adaptability is your secret weapon. Don't hold on to the status quo; be willing to let go of an outdated habit that isn't working for you anymore."
aquarius,2011-03-18,"Your conservative response to financial struggles may be the most sensible approach now, but it probably isn't the best answer in the long run. Tightening your belt is necessary today because you cannot spend what you do not have. But the problem is complex and may benefit from multiple courses of action. Try following fiscal responsibility with your own version of a stimulus package, since investing some money may be just as important as saving it."
pisces,2011-03-18,"A recent decision probably sent a message to others that you truly meant business. Now it's time to solidify what you already began. You might need to change directions, yet it's not wise to tell others what you're thinking today. Instead of saying what's on your mind, it may be smarter to withhold your intentions. Make the most of your power by conserving it until you are fully ready to take action."
aries,2011-03-19,"Although you may have a lot of work on your plate today, boredom sets in quickly. However, it's not time yet to leave your current routine behind, even if your fantasies of escape are quite vivid. Don't let go of your dreams; just put them on the back burner for now. After your commitments are fulfilled you can explore ways to break free."
taurus,2011-03-19,"You may play the role of the serious romantic today and could benefit from stirring up interest within an existing relationship or looking for a new one. But your somber approach could prevent you from reaching your goals. Fortunately, a sudden breakthrough can change everything in an instant. If you are struck by the light of truth now, don't fight it."
gemini,2011-03-19,"Normally, you make promises with the intent of keeping them, but this isn't such a normal day. Something unexpected could occur, causing you to go back on your word and giving you a bit of explaining to do. But looking for reasons may be futile now. Instead of trying to figure out what happened, concentrate on improving the current situation. Focus your attention on being practical and save the philosophical inquiry for another day."
cancer,2011-03-19,"Your goals may shift today, leaving you floundering with uncertainty as you approach the weekend. Changing your schedule might not be worth the stress; just follow through with your previous commitments, exactly as promised. Nobody has to know what you are thinking now, even if your heart isn't being fed by your current actions. Nevertheless, don't keep your thoughts inside because you'll feel a lot freer after they are out in the open."
leo,2011-03-19,"You may be very hard on yourself today, even if you feel the emotional support of others through their words and praise. Still, you are tempted to ignore a friend's optimistic perspective or might even question his loyalty. Your non-conformist point of view could precipitate a crisis if you begin to doubt your own judgment. Simply employ the healthiest strategy possible based upon what you already know."
virgo,2011-03-19,"Today's Virgo Full Moon in your 1st House of Physicality is likely creating stress in your body. How you are able to move with this intense energy flow could be a mystery, yet your happiness depends upon finding a sensible solution. Don't try to force the issue. When others see that you can be graceful under pressure, they will continue to accept you as their leader, whether or not you asked for the part."
libra,2011-03-19,"You may be feeling a bit discouraged today and it could be particularly difficult to shake off the negative energy. You might attempt to share a previously hidden story, yet the more you talk, the less you'll be able to remember about your problem. The more you attempt to reconstruct your buried feelings, the more elusive they become. Just relax and don't try to change anything. Your happiness may be waiting around the very next corner."
scorpio,2011-03-19,"Today's Full Moon floods your 11th House of Long-Term Goals and activates your dreams. Although your spirit feels revitalized, the Full Moon's opposition to unorthodox Uranus urges you to take a risky shortcut. However, hard work is the best way to get what you want. Meanwhile, the looming Sun-Uranus conjunction continues to tempt you to experiment. Instead, stick to the tried and true method over a radical new course of action."
sagittarius,2011-03-19,"The Virgo Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Status today, giving you the impetus to dig in your heels and make a political statement. Although you may see yourself as a radical troublemaker, you might not be as disruptive as you think you are now. Thankfully, you won't need to turn everything upside down in order to make the progress you seek."
capricorn,2011-03-19,"The pragmatic Virgo Full Moon should help you to keep your mind on your work. However, she is rattling your 9th House of Adventure, encouraging your secret dreams about going on a spiritual journey. For now, it's smarter to set aside impractical ideas of traveling around the world. Rather than flying off to a foreign land, try studying its culture or learning its language, instead. You may end up discovering there are many ways to feed your wanderlust."
aquarius,2011-03-19,"Your heated interactions with others today could be motivated by fear, whether you know it or not. You're afraid that a powerful person may be trying to control you, yet you don't really understand the reason. Fortunately, your current concerns will probably fade quickly, but you're still better off investigating further to quell any uncertainty. Be cautious in negotiations; a lack of finality now won't necessarily slow you down in the long run."
pisces,2011-03-19,"Today's Full Moon in your 7th House of Others is a reflection of the Great Paradox for you thin-skinned Fish. You must exist as part of a greater whole, since the school is more important than any one fish. However, you are also required to stand up for yourself by expressing your individuality. You may feel as if you're walking a fine line between being overly flexible and stubbornly rigid. The key to your current happiness now is practicing moderation in everything you do."
aries,2011-03-20,"The Sun's visit to your sign should boost your vitality and provoke you to initiate action. You are very eager now to start something new, but it makes sense to moderate your impulses. Instead of wasting energy on an unsuitable venture, think twice before you cannot undo what you've done. If it still seems like a good idea after some serious thought, then go ahead with your plan."
taurus,2011-03-20,"Although plants and animals respond positively to the new spring season, you may be less expressive. But your introversion today isn't about the fear of being seen; it's just that you may be busy doing important spiritual processing. Don't allow anyone to call you stubborn now; you're more eager for change than usual. However, take the time you need to feel safe enough before coming out of your shell."
gemini,2011-03-20,"If you are naturally extroverted, the Sun's entry into your 11th House of Friends marks an even busier social month ahead. You are now less interested in working hard to get ahead than taking it easy with your buddies and workmates. Instead of jumping through hoops to be noticed, relax and lose yourself in the group. There's no need to stir up any more trouble than is necessary."
cancer,2011-03-20,"This is quite a stressful day with random thoughts encouraging you to swing into action without any prior reflection on what you're about to do. This spontaneous behavior goes against your reflective nature, but it's a tough day to wait patiently for a cosmic starting gun. Ultimately, you should be able to restrain yourself, but still could experience somatic discomfort if you don't express your feelings. Be open to changing your mind, for the alternatives will continue to look better as the day goes on."
leo,2011-03-20,"Last year's unfulfilled dreams fade away as the Sun's entry into your 9th House of Big Ideas draws you into the future. But this cosmic turning point is not about defeat. In fact, you don't have the luxury of focusing on failure. Forget about the past and look forward toward a successful future. Although it may take a while to feel as if you are gaining ground again, don't lose sight of the prize."
virgo,2011-03-20,"You may be wondering if your friends are supporting your efforts now or just pacifying you with approving nods. The truth is that you won't necessarily know if someone's working against your progress. Unfortunately, it may be a waste of time and energy trying to figure it out. Just proceed slowly until you're given the green light. It's more important to enjoy yourself while working toward your goals today than it is to reach them."
libra,2011-03-20,"You are naturally predisposed toward working and playing with others, yet today your friend or partner might suggest that it's time to do something on your own. Don't think this is a rejection; it really isn't personal. It's just part of the evolution of any long-term relationship. Once you reestablish your metaphysical center, it will be even more fruitful to reunite and share your experiences with each other."
scorpio,2011-03-20,"It's frustrating to see all the options in front of you, knowing that your path has already been chosen for now. Even a slight improvement in the weather could be enough of a reason to increase your desire to set responsibilities aside and go out to play. Unfortunately, the timing isn't right. Do your chores first and take care of your obligations before distracting yourself with something fun."
sagittarius,2011-03-20,"You are probably feeling pleased with yourself now because your creative energy is running strong. It's easy to express yourself however you choose today. But something still prevents you from having as much fun as you expected. Letting go of previous assumptions can help, yet the ultimate solutions come with time. There's no need to be in such a hurry; slow down and enjoy the present moment."
capricorn,2011-03-20,"You may not respond well to someone pushing you to make a quick decision. You could even become argumentative if you have to defend your right to move at your own speed, rather than follow another person's arbitrary schedule. However, turning this difference of opinion into an open conflict is not a smart idea and won't bring you any closer to your heart's desire. Loosen up; your flexibility in response to external demands can turn a difficult situation around to your advantage."
aquarius,2011-03-20,"You may be dealing with conflicting agendas today. You need some downtime and think that working on your own is a smart idea. But don't miss your chance to learn from the people in your immediate environment. Unfortunately, there's no way to be alone and with others simultaneously. You can, however, benefit from the best of both worlds if you alternate your approach throughout the day."
pisces,2011-03-20,"It may seem as if others are just beginning their projects, yet you already started yours a while back. Take your efforts to the next level by creating more stability in your life. This could involve a new and different approach to allocating your time. Instead of focusing on an inspirational or creative process, increase productivity by prioritizing your tasks and then doing them methodically, one after another."
aries,2011-03-21,"You are not willing to live your life in the same old way anymore. You're ready for a big change, but you might not be able to communicate your new perspective to anyone else because you don't want to shock your friends and associates with your radical ideas. It's not necessary to stress about something you haven't yet shared; everything will come out into the open when the time is right."
taurus,2011-03-21,"You don't usually like surprises that can upset your day, so you probably won't just go along with whatever happens today if your plans run into a snafu. You might even consider reevaluating your long-term goals if they no longer fit into your current situation. Go ahead and think about changing the direction of your life, but don't make any important decisions for several days to allow things to settle down."
gemini,2011-03-21,"It may be quite exhilarating if you are given new freedom at work, yet it can also be a bit disconcerting if you didn't see any changes coming. Thankfully, you're skilled at reacting quickly and should be able to make the most of the current instability. Don't look back to wonder what you might have done differently. Instead, look ahead to think about what you can do to improve your life right now."
cancer,2011-03-21,"Your self-protective shell is developing cracks and you aren't feeling as safe as you want. Travel plans may need to be altered due to unforeseeable complications. Or, maybe, you discover something entirely new that can alter the way you perceive yourself in the world. No matter how this transit plays out, remember that your direction in life is shifting. Give yourself permission to explore the new paths that are opening in front of you."
leo,2011-03-21,"You may receive an important message from the universe today that ultimately takes you on an amazing adventure. You might feel as if a lightning bolt shatters your perceptions about a friend or business partner. You have held on to a belief that worked well for you in the past, but is no longer doing you justice now in the present. Don't be afraid to let go of an outmoded idea that can get in the way of your present happiness."
virgo,2011-03-21,"A powerful person who is close to you may act so far out of character now that you don't know how to interpret his or her odd behavior. You might react fearfully, but you also could laugh uncontrollably, as if you were a child hearing that school is canceled for the day because of bad weather. Keep in mind that others may act out your own rebellious streak. Instead of judging them for their outrageous behavior, do something crazy yourself."
libra,2011-03-21,"You may want to explore different relationship tactics today, but nothing seems to help you sidestep a disruption in your daily routine. You might be ready for something new, but may not be prepared for so much transition all at once. Sticking to your agenda could become a study in frustration, so stop holding on to old habits just because you don't want to deal with change."
scorpio,2011-03-21,"You may try new ways of approaching your work today, without telling anyone anything about your plans. However, you won't likely be able to contain your enthusiasm or your anxiety as emotions run to the extremes. You could say more than you intend, but it all happens so fast that you might blurt out the truth before you realize what you said. Don't stress about it; once you've spoken your piece, you'll feel a great sense of relief."
sagittarius,2011-03-21,"Perhaps your initial idea was to be more collaborative today. You want to hear everyone's opinions and then integrate what you learn into your position. But compromise is more challenging now than you expected, especially if you don't take your own strong point of view into account. Although it's fine to know what you want, don't be too eager to impose your will on others unless you want to start a fight."
capricorn,2011-03-21,"Your need for order at home and in the family can make it difficult to handle the surprising twists and turns that come out of nowhere today. Although you may think you need to react quickly to capitalize on the power shift, there's nothing you must do now. The big shift is not in your behavior but in your emotional reaction. As you change your mind, everything else in your life will follow."
aquarius,2011-03-21,"Your ruling planet Uranus is in charge today as its alignment with the Sun in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment brings radical shifts in your relationships with those you encounter on a daily basis. Others may seem less dependable now, or even less predictable. However, the real lesson is about learning to trust yourself, even if you don't meet someone else's expectations. When you stop judging yourself, your judgments of everyone else will mellow, too."
pisces,2011-03-21,"Your friends don't know what to expect from you now because you aren't interested in toeing the party line. You want to be treated fairly and are ready to cut your ties to make your point. Unfortunately, financial concerns can make your decisions more complicated because you must be able to meet your expenses. Preemptive downsizing makes sense; don't wait until it's too late."
aries,2011-03-22,"You have your own agenda now and won't be easily distracted from your goals. Your relentless drive could seem obsessive to others, but you should still be able to appear easygoing, even if you're not. Although your powerful determination works in your favor today, be wise in knowing when to call it a day. Thankfully, time isn't running out as fast as you think."
taurus,2011-03-22,"The Moon's move into your 7th House of Companions raises the stakes in an intense disagreement. Your stubbornness can help you win an argument today, but the price you must pay could be too severe. Your victory will likely be hollow if the emotional drama drains you of your energy. Make the best case you can for your point of view, but then be willing to shift gears and meet the other person halfway."
gemini,2011-03-22,"You are able to manipulate reality now by choosing your words carefully. You are very clever and can easily alter other people's perceptions without them being conscious of what you are doing. Unfortunately, you might not be fully aware of the impact you can have on those around you, so think about what you need to say before unconsciously hurting someone near to your heart."
cancer,2011-03-22,"You are ready to let someone at work know exactly how you feel as you express yourself with power and certainty. But it's hard to bring these complex emotions out into the open. Your feelings are bouncing all over the place, and no single action can handle all the nuances. Nevertheless, take a risk and communicate your experience to chip away at the walls between you and others."
leo,2011-03-22,"You can see the positive side of nearly anything, even in a situation that others would think is very difficult. It's not that you are in denial; it's just that you can be optimistic and pessimistic at the same time now. Fortunately, this gives you an advantage when managing co-workers, for they will be more willing to follow your lead when they see that you are being completely honest."
virgo,2011-03-22,"You are feeling empowered today to apply your intelligence and think your way out of an emotionally intense predicament. You may worry at first that you're being lured into a situation that could trap you. But upon a more thorough analysis, you realize the power of positive thought. Don't allow apparent limitations to hold you back; instead, face them and let your adrenaline fuel your growth."
libra,2011-03-22,"Although you may be hopeful about a current relationship, your emotions are running on high alert today. You would prefer to minimize all melodramas now, but they seem to follow you wherever you go. Instead of avoiding involvement, remain open to other people's processes without feeding your own fears into the story. Ultimately, your optimistic attitude can tilt the scales in a positive direction."
scorpio,2011-03-22,"The Moon's visit to your sign foretells of a couple of days of heightened emotions, yet the changes you go through now can be of lasting significance. You might be fearful of what you don't know. You may react defensively by holding on to an old relationship or memory that isn't serving your best interests. But don't be reckless; suddenly dropping someone or something can be counterproductive. Take your time to see where the current energy leads."
sagittarius,2011-03-22,"You are ready to hide your anger today as the potent Scorpio Moon enters your 12th House of Secrets. Nevertheless, your attraction to someone special could lure your feelings out into the open, driving away any lingering negativity. You may be fearful of going deeper and resist taking a long, hard look at all your options. Just remember, anything that is buried now will likely come back to the surface in a few days."
capricorn,2011-03-22,"Close friends and family can give you strength now without even realizing that they are helping you out. Oddly, it isn't anything that they do that's so great. What's important is that you know you could lean on them if you had to in a pinch. Thankfully, you probably don't need to be rescued today because your own efforts should pay off if you maintain a positive attitude."
aquarius,2011-03-22,"You appear to be more optimistic than you feel today. Others see you as an inspiration, for your ""can do"" attitude motivates them to make an extra effort on the job. Although you can get a lot done on your own, you still might think that you missed your mark. Getting stuck in your personal dissatisfaction won't help anything. Instead, concentrate on the good you can do for everybody else and your confidence will return quickly."
pisces,2011-03-22,"You may have a few angels watching over you today. It's as if someone or something is clearing a path for you right through a difficult situation. Rest assured that your choices are being supported, so be bold and take a risk -- and if possible, reach out to help someone else. In this manner, you can be a conduit, receiving the blessings and then, in turn, passing them along to others who could use a little magic, too."
aries,2011-03-23,"It's unproductive to get angry for no apparent reason, but you cannot prevent your emotions from impacting your life by simply hiding them. Burying your negative feelings might postpone a difficult interaction, yet denial can also make matters even worse in the long run. It's best to acknowledge your ongoing process and bring things out into the open, gently and with kindness."
taurus,2011-03-23,"You may be frustrated in your attempts to find inner peace, especially if someone with authority places strict limitations on you. Unfortunately, rebellion may be a waste of time and energy since you probably won't overcome the external resistance you face now. Choose your battles wisely and don't struggle against the inevitable."
gemini,2011-03-23,"People appear to come out of the woodwork today when the Moon enters your 7th House of Relationships. Thankfully, most of them could be rather upbeat and even inspirational. You can benefit from your interactions with anyone who encourages you with their big ideas and motivates you with their confidence. Turn the tables and act in a generous manner in someone else's life."
cancer,2011-03-23,"You do well when you are in control and operating only on blind faith for a short while, but a situation can become uncomfortable if you have to pretend that everything is okay. Instead of covering up your uncertainty with foolish behavior, try being honest and letting everyone know exactly where you stand. Fortunately, this strategy takes little effort on your part. An additional benefit is that others will like you more if they know that you are being authentic."
leo,2011-03-23,"You may be on the rebound now as new possibilities for fun and games enter your life. Although you might have struggled recently, the skies are brighter and the horizons are clearer today. But complications can be hiding in the shadows and you could become discouraged rather easily if your plans run amok. Ignoring reality will delay the inevitable. However, shining the light of your awareness into the darkness can expose negativity and transmute it into something positive."
virgo,2011-03-23,"You know what you have to do today, but you may have difficulty concentrating if you are attracted to something else. It's challenging to ignore an enticing person, even if you should keep your mind on work. Acknowledging your feelings doesn't mean you must act on them. Integrating your desires could be a smarter strategy than just trying to bury them out of sight, since they will just resurface stronger later on."
libra,2011-03-23,"You don't usually commit to more than you can do, but you may say yes when you should say no. Your irrational optimism can lead to a heap of problems today. But the hard times should fade away later in the day, giving you a second lease on your life. Don't introduce too much freedom into your life all at once, or you may become uncomfortable with the number of choices."
scorpio,2011-03-23,"You may feel as if the emotional lights go out when the Moon exits your sign today, leaving you with a sense of emptiness. But you aren't so quick to become distracted these days, especially if your workmates seem flakier than usual, requiring you to take charge. Fortunately, you can adapt to the changing circumstances fast enough, enabling you to handle the responsibility that now falls in your lap."
sagittarius,2011-03-23,"You may be hurting today as ill-intended words are tossed at you by someone who's trying to manipulate you. Usually, you could let this negativity go and move on. But the Moon's return to your sign this afternoon makes you more sensitive than at other times. Meanwhile, Mercury in Aries is slowing down to turn retrograde, requiring you to learn something significant about being patient."
capricorn,2011-03-23,"You may find it difficult to suppress your creative urges today, and you'll be even less happy if someone gets in the way of how you express yourself. You might lash out if you believe that he or she is the source of your current stagnation. Unless you are very careful, you could take your anger out on the wrong person. If you feel the shadows encroaching, consciously guide yourself out of the dark and back into the light."
aquarius,2011-03-23,"You may be feeling bent out of shape today and aren't interested in light and easy conversations. You're much more drawn to the center of the volcano now. Paradoxically, delving into other people's hidden motivations can also become your own journey inward. Don't take the easy way out and intellectualize what you learn. Instead, let the process continue until your feelings reveal the truth you've been seeking all along."
pisces,2011-03-23,"Your workweek continues to be very intense, revealing subtle secrets from the shadows of your awareness. The adventurous Sagittarius Moon is in your 10th House of Career, encouraging you to believe that no professional task is impossible. Although self-confidence can work wonders, unfounded optimism doesn't help at all. Do whatever it takes to keep your feet on the ground. If you keep it real today, you should be able to achieve success."
aries,2011-03-24,"You are continuing to feel the incoming waves of excitement, yet recent commitments could prevent you from taking action just yet. Your daydreams keep your anticipation alive, even as you face pressure to meet your obligations. There are circumstances you can't change, so accept what's happening and just get busy. Don't worry about missing out; the fun should follow once the work is done."
taurus,2011-03-24,"You have a hard time settling down today and unless you monitor your thoughts carefully throughout the day, you could easily be provoked because you think you are being threatened. Impulsive statements won't likely get you where you want to go. Instead of talking too much, try listening to gain a different perspective."
gemini,2011-03-24,"Your key planet Mercury can get you into trouble today, especially if you think you know more than anyone else. You may be quite clever, but constantly showing off your sarcastic wit may be inappropriate. People around you will surely grow tired of your relentless verbal aggression. Since they might not be in the mood for your sharp tongue now, they could just abruptly end the conversation. It's simple; play nice if you don't want to play alone."
cancer,2011-03-24,"You don't like your role of being the one who must remind everyone else to be responsible now. You may try to avoid being the authority figure because you want to have fun. You're tempted to act defiantly, but it's best to keep your irritation to yourself today and take care of business. Don't be discouraged; you'll have time later in the week to break free and be silly."
leo,2011-03-24,"Although you are sure that you could accomplish pretty much anything you set your mind to now, you're still cautious about making commitments you can't keep. Your confidence is softened by a realism that prevents you from going overboard. But don't get too serious or you'll miss an opportunity that's right in front of your nose. Stretch beyond your current comfort zone to reach your lofty goals."
virgo,2011-03-24,"It takes a lot of focus to find stability today, for you are feeling restless and reaching far into the distance for your satisfaction. But your goals will likely remain just beyond your grasp now. When you get closer to your destination, you seem to purposefully move it to someplace even further away. This strategy is not about productivity; it's simply your way to motivate yourself to cover a lot of new territory."
libra,2011-03-24,"You are feeling a need to overcome the resistance around you. You're eager to do whatever it takes to be a part of a partnership, but it seems as if someone is working against you for no apparent reason. Instead of continuing to try to create an emotional connection, back off just a bit. Once others have more breathing room, they might be more willing to meet you halfway."
scorpio,2011-03-24,"You don't want to accept no as the final answer, so you might try to rephrase your question. Although you were hoping for a resolution today, there's still a lot of gray between the blacks and the whites. Remember that it might require a few more days until the outcome is clear. Don't rush the process or you could head off in the wrong direction and subsequently waste even more time than you want."
sagittarius,2011-03-24,"It's difficult to know what to do today. Everything looks good at first until you realize that you made a faulty assumption and your philosophical reasoning can't steer you right. Instead of making circumstances worse, do what you should when you get lost. Stop! Don't go anywhere until you have regained your bearings. Ask for directions, if necessary. Then, continue on your way."
capricorn,2011-03-24,"You don't want to move very fast now and prefer that you finish one task before starting a new one. Unfortunately, the current situation may not be so accommodating, and you could be forced to take on a second project before you are ready. Don't be too quick to judge what's best. Instead, let go of your assumptions and see what happens next."
aquarius,2011-03-24,"Putting your dreams on the front burner now is a mixed blessing. Although you can be highly inspired when sharing your ideas for your future with your friend, you might take them too far. Keep in mind that you could be so unrealistic today that you inadvertently set yourself up for failure. Balance your fantasies with your common sense, instead. Let your head drift up into the clouds, but keep your two feet planted firmly on the ground."
pisces,2011-03-24,"You may be feeling pretty enthusiastic today as your adrenaline levels soar, giving you an urgent vision of what you need to do. You are impatient and you want to break free from the past. You are thinking about trying something that will surprise everyone who thinks you are so predictable. Don't act before the time is right. Even if it's hard to wait, it will be worth it in the long run."
aries,2011-03-25,Your efforts to prevent everything from falling apart may be futile today because your life grows more complex each time you succeed. It's similar to playing a video game; you are given a harder level to solve once you successfully finish your current level. It may be the right time for an entirely new strategy. Don't waste all your resources on maintaining control; just stop playing for a while. Giving up your authority may be the easiest thing you'll ever do.
taurus,2011-03-25,"It isn't your normal style to say something before thinking it all the way through. However, now you may be feeling mentally on edge, especially if you are trying to keep a secret. Hiding something only makes you more anxious. There's little reason to worry about offending someone today; it makes more sense to concern yourself with your own motives instead. If your intentions are good, then the details of what you say won't matter as much as you think."
gemini,2011-03-25,"Instead of successfully doing damage control for something you recently said or did, you could inadvertently dig your hole a little deeper today. Even with the best of intentions, you can still raise someone's anger. Naturally, a sincere apology works wonders, but it only has an impact if you truly mean it. Nevertheless, this little drama may still take another day to play out before your relationships begin to make sense again."
cancer,2011-03-25,"You might not be willing to back down from a confrontation today, even if it would be to your advantage if you did. You may feel as if you are beyond the point of no return which encourages you to take a risk for your beliefs. You don't have as much to lose as you think. Just be certain that the current issue is important enough before you jeopardize what you have already gained."
leo,2011-03-25,"Your plan of attack may be a fine one, but it certainly isn't perfect. When your current situation changes, you must be willing to adapt or you can lose your competitive edge. Unfortunately, you're more rigid in your thinking than you realize, and your refusal to modify your agenda could alienate your closest friends. Pay careful attention to what's happening now so you can respond intelligently, instead of stubbornly holding on to a fading dream for no reason."
virgo,2011-03-25,"Although you may be in a state of high anxiety today, you should be able to transform your uncomfortable tension into useful productivity. Throw away your expectations and admit that you don't know exactly where you are going. Nevertheless, say what's on your mind, even if it puts you in a socially awkward position. Remain open to a completely different approach and then get ready to follow your new plan with confidence."
libra,2011-03-25,"You should receive cooperation and support from others today, but it might not arrive in the manner you would prefer. It may even seem as if your best friend or partner is working against you, but that's not what is occurring. Everyone appears to be marching to their own drummers and you would be smart to let them. Your friends and colleagues will show up to help you if you give them the latitude they need now."
scorpio,2011-03-25,"You might have a breakthrough on the financial front today, but you'll probably still need to scale back your plans prior to initiating action. Fortunately, you're not afraid to try something you've never done before. You're able to learn new techniques so easily now that others are surprised by your adaptability. The downside is that they may not be able to grasp the complexity of your life. Even if you are tempted to accomplish a lot, don't bite off more than you can chew."
sagittarius,2011-03-25,"Everyone thinks they know just what you're feeling today because the upfront Sagittarius Moon encourages you to wear your heart on your sleeve for all to see. There is no easy escape now, for denying your emotions gives them additional strength. Your best choice is to freely express your feelings to a trusted friend on a regular basis to keep the drama at a minimum."
capricorn,2011-03-25,"Although you're being challenged as instability continues to plague you today, you still want everything in perfect running order. You prefer not to worry about where to focus your attention. But you cannot forget about your responsibilities and just turn your back on your work. Nevertheless, it makes sense to wait and see which way the currents of change are flowing before you take irrevocable action."
aquarius,2011-03-25,"You probably have too much on your plate now, and it may be helpful to lean on your friends. You are quite surprised when others quickly come to your assistance, demonstrating that you are not alone. But you should be careful about how you communicate or you might anger someone with your sarcastic humor. Slow down and think before you speak. Being extra polite can make everything go smoother."
pisces,2011-03-25,"You become more pensive throughout the day, which could lead you into a weekend without too much to do. However, exercising self-restraint is not the same thing as suppressing your feelings. Spending a bit of time by yourself will help you process the most meaningful images from your daydreams. Contemplation is fine as long as you keep your feelings flowing."
aries,2011-03-26,"You don't want to explain every decision you make today because you realize that logic isn't always the most important thing. Talking about your choices now can actually detract from your experience and you would rather focus on the present moment and just follow your intuition. Remember, you don't need to get anyone's approval for what you are feeling."
taurus,2011-03-26,"You may have your own idea about how the day should go today, but others cannot read your mind. It's smarter to go out on a limb and let those close to you know what you want now. But even if you share your desires, you still might be misinterpreted if a friend or family member makes an incorrect assumption about your intentions. Taking sufficient time to explain your motives can prevent headaches for everyone involved."
gemini,2011-03-26,"You have very specific emotional needs now, yet you might not be able to find the right words to convey them. To complicate matters, it's easy for you to imagine the worst because your dreams are spilling over into the real world, making it difficult to separate illusion from reality. Thankfully, struggling to discern the truth won't be necessary if you remember to be flexible enough to allow fact and fiction to exist side by side."
cancer,2011-03-26,"Your natural tendency to be so sensitive can be a lot to handle now if you get into a disagreement with someone close to you. Your resistance to change can make matters even worse, especially if you're afraid of losing your sense of identity. Thankfully, you can make the most of the gentle Venus-Neptune conjunction by consciously softening your stance while maintaining your current perspective."
leo,2011-03-26,"The Moon's harsh conjunction with controlling Pluto may provoke you to express your fears in an overly emotional manner. However, if you are frustrated by other people's inability to do their jobs, losing your temper can clear the air of pent-up tension. Thankfully, an apology can go a long way now, especially if your melodramatic words seemed to be excessively harsh. Others will be quicker to forgive you if they can tell that you're genuinely sorry."
virgo,2011-03-26,"Don't be so certain that you know what's happening because your reality filter isn't working all that well today. You may have enough stars in your eyes now that you cannot see what's right in front of you. There are specific chores that need to be done, but your lack of concentration makes it difficult to be efficient. But there's no need to be too self-judgmental; just do the best you can and pick up where you left off tomorrow."
libra,2011-03-26,"Your key planet Venus aligns with dreamy Neptune today, making the veil between this world and others thinner than usual. Don't resist the flow of information, even if you don't understand where it's coming from or what action you should take. Thankfully, you don't have to do anything special now, except listen closely to the messages from beyond."
scorpio,2011-03-26,"Your key planet Pluto is touched by the Moon today, setting a tone for deep psychological change. Take this opportunity and dig beneath the surface to explore the spiritual truths coming your way. Move cautiously into unfamiliar ground; while avoiding uncertainty will feel safer right now, it won't keep you on the track to personal transformation."
sagittarius,2011-03-26,"You may be very hopeful that your day will improve later on, but you might be so fearful now that you overreact by placing too many expectations on what is happening. Wanting more from your everyday interactions isn't harmful if you can avoid becoming obsessed with the idea of success. Staying flexible can make the difference between frustration and happiness."
capricorn,2011-03-26,"There is a lot at stake today and you are tempted to take extreme action to turn the tables in your favor. However, micromanaging domestic affairs can backfire if you fall short of keeping up with all the complex interactions. Loosening the reins a bit can ultimately increase your connections with those you love, which will ironically also make you more productive in the long run."
aquarius,2011-03-26,"The Moon's square to desirable Venus turns your social world upside down today. Naturally, this cosmic twist can make everything at home more complicated because there are too many frayed tempers and loose ends to keep straight. Your most intelligent strategy now is to focus on the bigger picture, without being overly concerned about the details. Be ready and willing to change your plans as circumstances require."
pisces,2011-03-26,"You are watching the distant horizon now as you consider taking a new direction. Your current need to redefine your goals intensifies as you learn more about the politics of what's currently happening around you. Meanwhile, someone may be trying to gain power and you're eager to prevent it. Unfortunately, you aren't strong enough to face the resistance directly today, so working through the channels can be the most effective way to reach your destination."
aries,2011-03-27,"You may have second thoughts about your current direction in life today. Even if you have achieved professional success you still might wonder how long you'll be able to maintain your current position. However, the deeper message now is not to take things for granted. Considering your alternatives is fine; just don't make any lasting decisions for a few more days."
taurus,2011-03-27,"You are eager to hang out with like-minded people now that your key planet Venus is traveling through your 11th House of Friends. Although you prefer to include others in your plans, there's still a part of you that doesn't want to waste time just going along with the group. You have your own dreams to follow today, so don't be afraid to spend some time by yourself, even if you think that you don't want to be alone."
gemini,2011-03-27,"Your friends may come up with a crazy plan that sounds like a lot of fun today. However, previous commitments can keep you from joining the group until you fulfill your promises. Thankfully, being responsible now won't necessarily prevent you from having a pleasurable time if you're willing to plan out your day. Avoiding details sounds like a good idea until you realize that facing reality is your ticket to happiness."
cancer,2011-03-27,"You would like to be independent today so you can do whatever you want. Unfortunately, you may feel restraint coming from two directions. Domestic responsibilities or household chores could prevent you from thinking of yourself over others. Additionally, you might lose your enthusiasm for adventure if a close friend or partner comes to you with a serious problem that requires your help. Don't worry; you'll have a chance to do your own thing within a few days."
leo,2011-03-27,"Dreams of adventure get mixed up with romantic fantasies today, tempting you to believe that you can actually embark on that wild safari, mountain trek or space exploration. However, you are probably emotionally tied to your regular Sunday activities and aren't that willing to give up your routine. Anxiety mounts because it's difficult to reconcile your reckless desires with your need for caution. When you realize that there's no quick fix for your current stress, it will probably begin to dissipate on its own."
virgo,2011-03-27,"Although you want to have a good time today, you might overplan your day, making playful activities seem too structured. Give yourself permission to skip a scheduled event so you can enjoy a bit of guilt-free chill time. Leaving your day wide open increases the possibility for real magic to occur while interacting with others."
libra,2011-03-27,"Beautiful Venus, your ruling planet, enters your 6th House of Work today, encouraging you to start a remodeling project. But even if you don't begin the work in earnest now, at least grab a notebook and start sketching some designs. Additionally, if there are problems in a current relationship, this is an excellent time to address them. Don't worry if you have several false starts along your way because time is on your side."
scorpio,2011-03-27,"The sheer number of things you must do continues to be daunting, but the Capricorn Moon is holding your feet to the ground even if your head is in the clouds. Although you are tempted to float away into your fantasies, your current calling also involves assisting with the care of family members or friends. Instead of allowing yourself to get overwhelmed with your obligations, refocus on the precious heart connections you have already made."
sagittarius,2011-03-27,"It's increasingly difficult for you to pay proper attention to all the details that seem to keep landing on your plate. You're usually not so good with the minutia anyway, yet now with Venus shifting into spacey Pisces, you're even less inclined to know the specifics. Thankfully, you should still be able to get through this challenging phase by widening your personal boundaries and opening your heart."
capricorn,2011-03-27,"You have a lot going on at home today -- so much, perhaps, that you cannot easily make time for your own pursuits. The somber Capricorn Moon in your 1st House of Personality intensifies your no-nonsense approach to living. Be careful, you can inadvertently try to make someone else the bad guy when it's actually you that wants to stir things up."
aquarius,2011-03-27,"You are becoming more aware of your issues about money, and learning to handle the situation now can go a long way toward stabilizing your life. Ultimately, the fiscal conditions that are causing you trouble today are fixable. However, the problem is really about you. An intense and honest discussion can help you understand the relationship between your self-esteem and the money you make. The higher your self-worth, the more worth your self actually has."
pisces,2011-03-27,"Venus, the love planet, enters your sign and your 1st House of Personality today, gracing you with an extra dose of charm. Don't accept less for yourself now; make the extra effort to look good so you feel good, too. Nevertheless, don't be frivolous with your energy; spending time with friends is healing for your soul as long as you don't overdo the fun."
aries,2011-03-28,"You may be using an all-or-nothing strategy today to accomplish your goals, but could possibly hurt someone's feelings without even knowing it. You are so resolute to reach your dreams that you might overstep your welcome. You will feel more appreciated if you can see what's happening from the perspective of others, too. Slow down and experience the present moment instead of living for the imagined success of the future."
taurus,2011-03-28,"You are eager for others to accept your point of view today, especially if you aren't willing or don't have the energy to defend your position. Either way, it won't be that simple, for there might be an emotional trap lurking right beneath the surface. Expressing your current opinion is encouraged, but the passionate reaction you receive in return can be more intense than you expect. There's no reason to be in such a hurry to share all of your ideas at once."
gemini,2011-03-28,"You don't need any additional stress in your life, but trying to avoid drama now just brings it closer. You might think that filling your social calendar will spread the intensity around and thereby make it easier to handle. However, this kind of strategy could backfire today. It's smarter to face uncomfortable issues head-on than trying to dance your way around them."
cancer,2011-03-28,"You are in a stressful phase now and you may be feeling the pressure to choose between your home and your career. However, any lack of support you are feeling from the people in your life will slowly and surely force you to go through your own metamorphosis. Try not to go overboard; letting go of old habits is required before you can begin to develop healthier new ones."
leo,2011-03-28,"Others may see you as ruthless now, but you're really just running on adrenaline and you don't have the time to stop and think. But a conflict at work could tempt you to manipulate someone else if you believe it's in the best interest of all involved. Unfortunately, you can be so self-righteous today that you fail to see anyone else's position. Loosen up; whatever you are doing, it's not as important as it seems."
virgo,2011-03-28,"Normally, you're content to work hard in a supportive role, but you may be frustrated now if you don't receive the recognition that you deserve. Still, you are able to separate your emotional needs from your job performance, enabling you to meet your professional obligations without revealing your true feelings. Unfortunately, your desire to hide your vulnerability comes with a price. It may be smarter to share your concerns in a manner that doesn't place blame on any one person."
libra,2011-03-28,"You may receive the support you need today, but it could be withdrawn at the very last minute. Change is in the air and you won't be able to go back to where you were. Unfortunately, you might not be able to solve the entire problem now. Thankfully, you're off to a fabulous start. Don't take no for an answer; if you do run into resistance, slow down, retreat and then try again when the time feels right."
scorpio,2011-03-28,"This may be one of those times when you cannot solve a dilemma, and there's no resolution in sight on an issue that's important to you now. You might discover that you just need some fireworks to clear the air. Even if you're not eager for change, you're still being drawn into a whole new set of circumstances. Although the clash between the old and the new incites you to stubbornly take a stand, you'll be better off proceeding slowly and letting the stress resolve on its own."
sagittarius,2011-03-28,"You may feel very creative today, but you still won't be able to charm your way through the current obstacles. Be careful, something will have to give if you push people too hard. The tension can be expressed through a personal drama, but delays or setbacks are symptoms of a deeper issue that also needs attention. Handle any resistance that surfaces now, for avoidance only makes matters worse."
capricorn,2011-03-28,"You don't want to be responsible for managing a situation where you are not fully prepared. You really don't need any surprises now, but the new landscape indicates that you could be thrown for a loop if you discover that someone has been working against you. Nevertheless, the smartest defense is an intelligent offense, so don't just wait for something bad to happen. Be proactive first so you don't need to be reactive later."
aquarius,2011-03-28,"You might believe that you can remain emotionally detached from what's happening, but your feelings are too connected with everything today. It may be frustrating when you realize that all your hard work still doesn't produce the income that you want. Canceling some of your travel plans might be enough to help you regain your lost balance. If you slow down you'll have a better chance of reaching your goals faster."
pisces,2011-03-28,"You might feel as if you are being manipulated by strong forces now. However, your peers may be doing the sensible thing by just trying to protect themselves from the tides of economic change. Paradoxically, your best strategy today is not tightening the reins, for you won't be able to control all the variables, no matter how hard you try. Thankfully, others may be ready to share in the responsibility. Loosen your grip and they will be able to help you even more."
aries,2011-03-29,"It would be wise today to reexamine the most important relationships in your life. Although you may think that all is well, chances are you're looking at life through a Pollyanna filter. Instead of relying on your overconfident nature now, stop and check in with those most significant to you. Ask your friends and partners how they're doing and then listen carefully to what they tell you. You might be surprised by what you hear, but you can make important improvements if you take what you learn to heart."
taurus,2011-03-29,"You may feel restricted today by too many tasks to complete for work. You could be ready to take a foolish chance just because you want to shake things up a bit. Fortunately, you're very capable of moderating your emotional expression if you have a specific goal in mind. If you give yourself permission to fantasize about your freedom, you should be able to continue on the same path until your current restlessness settles down."
gemini,2011-03-29,"You may be contemplating taking a different direction in your life these days. Whether or not your current thinking endures, right now you're ready to jump in and learn everything you can about something new. Fortunately, you're capable of absorbing the basics of a difficult discipline or technical skill quite quickly and are happy to show others how clever you are. But appearing smart isn't enough, so consider how to take your brilliant ideas and transform them into something that's actually real."
cancer,2011-03-29,"You may be feeling let down or regretful today and it can be challenging to settle your thoughts. There's too much going on in your mind, making it hard to filter out the extraneous noise. Don't be overly self-judgmental; it's natural to be fearful when so much is unknown about your future. The best thing you can do now is to pay attention to your heart's desire while you continue processing everything that's happening."
leo,2011-03-29,"People around you may be acting strangely today as the quirky Aquarius Moon visits your 7th House of Others. But some of the eccentric behavior that you observe might be more reflective of your desire to do something exciting, even if you must stay focused on your current job. Claim your power by telling others what you want, instead of projecting your need for independence and unconventionality onto them."
virgo,2011-03-29,"It may be socially awkward for you to share your strong feelings for someone today. But you could end up regretting your actions if you let fear prevent you from expressing what's in your heart. You are being pulled in two directions now and no matter what you do, you might wish you took the other course. Thankfully, just knowing that there is no single correct path should help you be less self-judgmental. Trust your instincts to tell you when the time is right."
libra,2011-03-29,"You would like to believe that all is well and that everyone is doing okay. Unfortunately, this may not be the entire story today as negativity from a recent interaction leaks over into current events. As peace-loving as you may be, it now falls on you to stir up a bit of trouble. Don't worry about what others think. It's your job now to play the role of the heavyweight and talk about those subjects that everyone else is avoiding."
scorpio,2011-03-29,"You may feel pretty optimistic about your role in the world right now. Although your place may not seem to be overly important in the big scheme of things, you can see the positive impact that you have on a day-to-day basis. Remember, success comes in many shapes and sizes. Fame and fortune are on one end of the spectrum while personal meaning and spiritual growth are on the other. Don't judge yourself by what others think you should do; instead, pick your own path and follow your heart."
sagittarius,2011-03-29,"Your key planet Jupiter is journeying through your 5th House of Spontaneity, encouraging you to have more fun playing with your friends. However, its current opposition to stern Saturn could be putting the brakes on your party mobile. Luckily, you can get ahead of the curve by doing more long-term planning. You'll be able to return to pursuing pleasure later, but now it's time to get serious about your future."
capricorn,2011-03-29,"Family matters may be taking up more of your time than planned, but the opportunities for growth and happiness make it difficult for you to remain uninvolved. Nevertheless, professional responsibilities are calling, and you cannot say no. Being busy in your personal life doesn't make following your career path any easier. Avoid making a final decision until the current distractions subside."
aquarius,2011-03-29,"Weird ideas are exploding in your brain and it's challenging to figure out what to do today. You want to take each idea and run with it, but you cannot possibly finish what you initiate. Be careful, for you could start enough projects to keep you busy for a very long time. However, don't stress if you still have lots of loose ends by the end of the day. It will be easy enough to clean up everything over the next few weeks during Mercury's retrograde."
pisces,2011-03-29,"You may be feeling some fiscal pressure and there doesn't seem to be a quick way out of your current predicament. But it's not just about increasing your income or cutting down on your expenses. Somehow, the entire global financial condition has you spooked and it could take a complete overhaul of your lifestyle before you become fully comfortable again. Any positive changes, however small, you make now will help; just remember everything doesn't have to happen overnight."
aries,2011-03-30,"Your mind is racing now, challenging you to hold on to any one thought and put it into action as mental Mercury turns retrograde in your sign today. You may become frustrated because you cannot figure out what you're doing wrong. But don't attempt to force anything to happen; instead, enjoy the speed at which your ideas seem to run through your mind, even if you don't see much progress now. It could make more sense to retreat until you're ready to assert yourself again."
taurus,2011-03-30,"Although you appear cool and calm to your friends at work now, they would get into trouble if they jumped to any quick conclusions about you today. Beneath your easygoing veneer, you could be a jangled bundle of nerves, yet you'll likely keep your insecurities to yourself. Instead of trying to settle your thoughts, allow yourself to be entertained by them without having to say anything at all."
gemini,2011-03-30,"Your key planet Mercury stands still in restless Aries and your 11th House of Groups, raising your need for social activity to the next level. You may be able to have fun today, but you still have to pay attention to your physical energy or you could exhaust your reserves. It's not easy to hold yourself back when you're having such a good time, but you'll be glad you did."
cancer,2011-03-30,"You might feel reclusive today while the rest of the world seems to be moving forward. Nevertheless, you aren't quite ready for what's about to happen. The supersensitive Pisces Moon is reminding you that it is wiser to wait a few days before pushing your agenda ahead, even if you're impatient today. Don't worry about being judged by others; trusting your intuition won't steer you wrong."
leo,2011-03-30,"You want to start something new now, but your impatience may have you missing an important piece of the puzzle. Fortunately, you can navigate the difference between easy success and risky trouble if you aren't in such a hurry. A wild ride to an exciting place is in front of you, so don't ruin it by starting without taking the time to consider the consequences of your actions."
virgo,2011-03-30,"Talking about your feelings before you start your careful analysis of the facts can be more problematic than useful today. You may forget to consider how someone might react to your bold ideas, only to be surprised with the speed at which the emotional landscape changes. It's hard to navigate through the nervous tension, but your spontaneous expression can move things along a lot faster than you expect."
libra,2011-03-30,"Your attempts to keep to yourself today won't work because you'll likely get drawn out of your reclusion before you can fully disappear. It's quite a challenge to focus on your work when there are so many enticing distractions, including fascinating conversations with different people happening throughout the day. Paradoxically, you'll get a lot accomplished when you are still plugged into the world around you. Find a way to balance business with pleasure."
scorpio,2011-03-30,"You may be feeling emotional dissonance today as you try to reconcile your desire to be compassionate with your frustration at work. Unfortunately, your associates aren't doing their jobs, yet you still want to encourage everyone to contribute as best as he or she can. You are perceptive enough to see the most efficient way to do a task and you want to assume authority to make something happen. Keep in mind that you cannot control others; nonetheless, you can find satisfaction by changing your expectations."
sagittarius,2011-03-30,"You can cleverly arrive at many ways to avoid work today because you have a bad case of spring fever. However, escaping from your responsibilities isn't all fun and games, making it unlikely that you'll do anything irrational. Still, your mind continues to work overtime. You might be able to talk your way into a sweet situation by capitalizing on your current charm. Take a risk, but be patient; it's going to take a while to get what you want."
capricorn,2011-03-30,"You must face an interesting dilemma today that pits your current desire for independence against your innate need for security. This dichotomy becomes increasingly complex if you over-personalize your experiences. If you believe that your freedom is being squelched, you could react impulsively in a way that jeopardizes your position at work. There's no need to push your agenda on anyone else. Accept what you have and wait until the calm returns before you do anything rash."
aquarius,2011-03-30,You may be feeling great as everything clicks into place today -- especially when you are packing so much into a short amount of time. Don't add too many new activities or you'll end up being overbooked. Make a conscious choice to lessen your load by moving an appointment or two to another day when you'll have more flexibility in your schedule. Allow room for the unexpected.
pisces,2011-03-30,"You are trying to integrate the changes that are occurring daily, and this is quite a task. If you have been secretly wishing for the pace to slow down, you may temporarily get what you wanted. Although you won't necessarily have control over the general timeline, everything will flow smoother if you are less demanding of yourself and others."
aries,2011-03-31,"You have unrealistic expectations today and it's a mixed blessing that you don't even know it. Setting your goals too high could lead to disappointment, but it also causes you to reach farther than usual. Even if you fall short of your stated destination, the journey into new territory can be quite rewarding. Keep in mind that your performance is less important now than your experience."
taurus,2011-03-31,"You aren't so sure about following your dreams, even if you enjoy dreaming about your future. It's easier for you to cope when you're dealing with reality rather than when you're meandering through your imagination. Nevertheless, the visions bubbling into your awareness today can inspire you to take direct action that leads to accomplishing something significant."
gemini,2011-03-31,"You may be pretty easygoing at work today, but you might change your tune quickly if someone gets in the way of your plans. However, you must be careful about jumping to conclusions because your imagination is working overtime and you could get confused about where you are going. Don't let self-doubt creep into your current decision-making process. If you're uncertain, wait a couple of days and your clarity will likely return."
cancer,2011-03-31,"Your travel plans could unravel today, causing your anxiety level to rise. But whether an upcoming trip is for business or pleasure, a change of plans will ultimately be for the best. Instead of focusing on what might have been, readjust to the current circumstances and reconsider all your options. However, the situation is still in flux so try not to make any final decisions until the weekend."
leo,2011-03-31,"You may be in trouble if your calendar is booked so tightly that you don't have any flexibility built into your schedule. Perhaps you thought that you could come up with a quick fix to your plans if something went wrong, but now it looks like you were being overly optimistic. Don't panic; it might take a few days to untangle all the variables, but you should be able to put the pieces back together in a way that's even better than it was before."
virgo,2011-03-31,"It's challenging to be generous if you're experiencing a shortage of expendable cash now. Fortunately, you are still able to bring something special to a relationship if you rethink your strategy and make use of what you have. Instead of buying extravagant presents, consider your presence to be a gift unto itself. Showing up with an open heart and simple expectations will probably be sufficient to take a relationship to the next level."
libra,2011-03-31,"A friend or co-worker may not be paying attention to all the facts today, so you might take it upon yourself to set things straight. Although you don't enjoy being a taskmaster, it's likely that others will appreciate your leadership skills now, especially if they are floundering in their efforts. Don't worry about appearing heavy-handed; just take of business, even if your decisions have a negative impact on those around you."
scorpio,2011-03-31,"It's obvious that your normal way of doing things may not do the trick now; however, you don't necessarily have a better strategy. Rethinking your approach to work is a smart plan, but your most creative ideas might not be very efficient. There's no need to judge yourself harshly if your productivity temporarily slips. If you don't get it right today, rest assured you'll be able to try again tomorrow."
sagittarius,2011-03-31,"Your undying sense of optimism usually works to your advantage, but the current opposition between Jupiter's confidence and Saturn's pessimism has you bouncing back and forth. Still, the positive thoughts should win the battle as jolly Jupiter radiates joy in your 5th House of Spontaneity. Take cues from your most serious friends today, but don't let their doubts influence your decisions."
capricorn,2011-03-31,"You may need to rethink your domestic strategy now, for without solid boundaries your personal affairs could interfere with your work. Be careful; you can inadvertently talk yourself into believing that you can handle pretty much anything without changing your course. Although you cannot do it alone, relying on your family can only take you so far. Assuming full responsibility for your professional life will make a big difference, but it might require you to partner up with someone on the job."
aquarius,2011-03-31,"Yesterday's optimism could quickly sour as your enthusiasm bumps into the hard practicality of long work hours. Fortunately, you have the extra stamina now to follow through on whatever you start, but you still might promise more than you can deliver. Don't wait until it's too late and you end up playing the role of a victim. Instead, act with conviction while you still have enough time to make something tangible happen."
pisces,2011-03-31,"The Moon's current visit to dreamy Pisces places a veneer of glamour on even the most ordinary experiences. But don't fall prey to believing your senses now, for that strategy only works if you're able to maintain a healthy perspective. Mixing up objective reality with subjective thoughts is great for writing poetry, but not so good for mapping out your future reality."
aries,2011-04-01,"You're ready to explore a spontaneous feeling today, but responsibilities at work may prevent you from starting anything new. However, your intense schedule won't necessarily put a halt to your talking about your current desires. Sharing a fantasy with someone special can be a perfect diversion now. Just remember that it's not the same thing as actually doing it. Don't rush into anything yet; the action could come as early as tomorrow when feisty Mars enters your sign."
taurus,2011-04-01,"You may not seem very enthusiastic today, especially if you're afraid that your positive attitude will heighten other people's expectations. At first you might present an easygoing appearance, but you won't be able to hide your more serious demeanor for long. Your concerns about the future are understandable, but try not to unconsciously rain on someone else's parade. Good news is likely already on the way."
gemini,2011-04-01,"You may need to get heavy-handed and play a parental role today, even if you don't have any children. Handling business matters will likely take precedence over more personal activities and you could be distracted from following through on a promise to someone at home. Although you are fully aware of your recent commitments, you might not be able to come through with the goods. Don't be too hard on yourself; set priorities and just do the best you can."
cancer,2011-04-01,"Today you can see glimpses of the future and realize that you may have made more commitments than you can possibly keep. Although you probably didn't mean to mislead anyone, everything seems to be taking longer than you anticipated. Your best strategy now is to cut back on your activities voluntarily. Don't wait for circumstances to force you to make changes while under duress. A stitch in time will save nine."
leo,2011-04-01,"You may be under pressure to make changes to your schedule today. Fortunately, the immediate solution may be as straightforward as postponing an appointment or two, but the longer-lasting issues could be more complex. Problems will resurface in a few weeks if you don't take care of them now. Although a quick fix is surely tempting, handling the cause rather than the symptom should resolve the situation for good."
virgo,2011-04-01,"You may be extra hard on someone who isn't living up to his or her end of a bargain. You don't want to be the heavyweight, but if others flake out you might have to be the one to give them a reality check. Thankfully, this is something you can do with some authority because you know exactly what must be done. However, an overbearing approach won't be the best way to make your point. Instead of issuing harsh criticism from your head, be kind and speak from your heart."
libra,2011-04-01,"You are caught in the middle of a relationship struggle and want to do the right thing. You truly want to be supportive of others today, yet you're afraid that you might encourage behavior that's counterproductive. It's not easy to get to the bottom of your current ethical dilemma now; any response seems to deepen the problem. Fortunately, the urgency for immediate resolution may not be as real as it seems. You can discuss the issue with others without having to resolve it today."
scorpio,2011-04-01,"You don't necessarily agree with your co-workers today, but might not know how much to say. Your perceptions could be more acute than theirs, yet it may not be wise to try to set them straight. Unfortunately, your high level of integrity might prevent you from simply going along with the group. Don't give up; let your associates know where you stand and then move on. However, you won't be able to change anyone's mind in an instant. They will alter their opinions when they are ready, and not one moment sooner."
sagittarius,2011-04-01,"At first, controlling others appears to get you what you want today, but this strategy could backfire without any advance notice. Your friends and associates might not be so willing to go along with your plan and there may not be much you can do about it. Instead of worrying about what anyone else does now, act consistently with your goals. Taking responsibility for yourself and doing exactly as you promised will bring more progress than trying to rein in someone else's erratic behavior."
capricorn,2011-04-01,You may be struggling with the gulf between your sensible plan and how executing it falls short of what's actually needed. The gap between the real and the ideal can provoke self-doubt as you begin to acknowledge that more hard work isn't the answer. It isn't productive to waste time with endless analysis or worry. A smarter tactic is to simply do the best you can without being attached to the outcome. You may be happily surprised with the results.
aquarius,2011-04-01,"Someone who is usually your ally may seem to be unsupportive of your efforts today. Your initial reaction might be to withdraw so you can protect yourself against this apparent defection. Unfortunately, retreat isn't your best course of action now; you can improve your game if you're open to hearing critical feedback. Listen to what's being said and integrate the new information into what you are already doing."
pisces,2011-04-01,"Although you believe that you're on the right course, you're actually bumping into walls today. The Moon's visit to your sign makes it easier to convince yourself that all is copacetic, but your rationalizations may not be well founded. Slow down rather than pushing harder against the resistance. Deliberation and gentle pressure work better now than bravado and grandiose gestures."
aries,2011-04-02,"Everything is happening so fast now that you won't even have time to think about what to do; you just do it. You barely finish one project or handle a personal issue when something new comes at you from a different direction. Fortunately, you are well equipped to react quickly when the Moon is in your sign. No planning is needed today; you can always make adjustments later on."
taurus,2011-04-02,"You may long for some peace and quiet now, but even if you're resistant to getting involved in a group activity, you're able to muster up enough energy to get by. Others may perceive you as lazy because they're unable to feel your enthusiasm. However, limiting most of your activity to the non-physical world of emotional fantasy isn't a waste of time since today's dreams can turn into tomorrow's reality."
gemini,2011-04-02,"You may be quite excited about what's ahead with six planets traveling through your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. Ironically, the future may seem more real than the present moment. Unfortunately, it may be much harder than you think to execute plans today. Instead of trying to manage all the variables and power your way toward your destination, let go of control. Floating on the waves without resistance is more productive now than struggling to control your direction."
cancer,2011-04-02,"You are feeling stressed out today because your friends expect you to be active now and you want to relax. Even if you spend much of the day at home, it's challenging to take your mind off unsettling dynamics at work or in your community. Thankfully, you don't have to bring the tension to resolution now. Instead, allow your feelings to ebb and flow with your own emotional tides, putting off significant decisions until the pressure subsides."
leo,2011-04-02,"Although you may be holding on to anger from an old emotional wound, it's hard to stay in a negative place for very long today. Six planets in enterprising Aries are activating your 9th House of Adventure, enabling you to turn anxiety into action. Once you find your pace, no one will likely get in your way. However if someone does pose trouble, you should be able to overcome your annoyance by talking about your feelings."
virgo,2011-04-02,"Typically, you're more interested in knowing that you have the facts right than exploring your feelings about what's happening. Today, however, you can push through old emotional limitations and into new territory because you want the most intense experience you can get. Your behavior might surprise your friends or partner because usually you're more cautious. Don't resist your desires because you're afraid of being judged. This is your opportunity to create positive change, so don't let it slip through your fingers."
libra,2011-04-02,"Working on a relationship now sounds easier than it actually is because it's difficult to rein in your thoughts and feelings. Still, it's a smart strategy to try your best. Be careful; if you attempt to procrastinate, you may have to deal with a close friend or partner who has a very different idea of what you should be doing today. Ultimately, don't worry too much about other people's expectations. Do what you can along the way, but take enough time to relax."
scorpio,2011-04-02,"You aren't so restrained in the expression of your feelings today because sweet Venus supports your key planet Pluto, making you less worried about a harsh reaction from anyone else. You might even get a kick out of stepping over the edge of acceptability, if only for the shock value. However, expressing your quirkiness is safer now because you also can focus your attention on whatever needs to get done. It's easier to get away with being weird when you are also efficient."
sagittarius,2011-04-02,"You may seem overly excited today as you express yourself wholeheartedly in nearly everything you do. Others may have a hard time keeping up with you as you try to fulfill your current obligations. Although you're on a creative roll, you still might feel as if you're running out of time. Remember that other people need to adhere to schedules, even if you're less concerned with the concept of linear time."
capricorn,2011-04-02,"Fortunately, your day could offer the respite you seek, though it still may be challenging for you to enjoy it. A hectic day on the home front magnifies your desire for some peace and quiet, but you'll probably be bored by the time you finally get it. Remember, there's no reason to create drama where none previously existed. Your attitude can make all the difference in the world."
aquarius,2011-04-02,"You may experience an intellectual breakthrough with respect to your place within the community today. You could learn something new from a close friend that helps you understand how much others value your contributions now. But rather than resting on your laurels and basking in the compliments, you're already ready for the next project. It's fine to push ahead, but first take time to acknowledge what you've already accomplished."
pisces,2011-04-02,"You may believe that the real world isn't all that important now as you indulge in your fantasies. Luckily, this can become quite a spiritual journey if you are ready to minimize your material needs. Nevertheless, no matter how this kind of non-physical thinking plays itself out, financial concerns could bring you crashing back down to earth. Attend to your commitments with the same urgency that you give your dreams so you can return to your creative pursuits as soon as possible."
aries,2011-04-03,"There's no reason to hold back in anything you do since today's impulsive Aries New Moon is all about you. If you experienced a false start recently, now is the perfect time to try again. If you are persistent, success could be yours. Don't be afraid to show up with your best intentions and a willingness to work harder than anyone else."
taurus,2011-04-03,"You may have woken up from a vivid dream last night, because your sleep was more restless than usual. Fortunately, you are able to shake it off if you simply jump into your busy day. Today's New Moon in your 12th House of Imagination certainly stirs up unconscious fears, but you can overcome them once you become aware of them. Remember, the more active you are now, the easier it will be to gain the confidence you need to feel better about your life."
gemini,2011-04-03,"Joining a community group or a political cause might sound like a good idea now, since you could be looking for a new hobby. But you're not going to be happy unless your distraction also has a positive social impact. Although you almost always enjoy mingling with others, choose something where you can see the results of your efforts right away."
cancer,2011-04-03,"Setting ambitious goals isn't enough; you must be prepared to make your move today in order to put your good intentions into motion. It would be a shame to waste this powerful moment of initiation without taking direct action since the enterprising Aries New Moon falls in your 10th House of Career. Don't worry about what you accomplish or how far along the path you actually travel. Remember, the first step is the most important one."
leo,2011-04-03,"You should be able to manage a complex scenario today, even if you don't consciously know the best way to deal with it. You may have already struggled with this issue more than once, but now a solution might suddenly pop into your mind that wasn't obvious before. Actually, there's no way to determine if your actions will have the desired effect. Take a chance and see where it goes. There's no rational reason to wait any longer to find out."
virgo,2011-04-03,"Today's events may initiate a journey of questioning, where the deeper you delve, the less you know. The current lesson is that real wisdom only arrives after you let go of your search. The transition point that contains the mysteries of birth, death and the cosmos occurs when one cycle ends and the next one hasn't yet started. The New Moon in your 8th House of Shared Feelings is a reminder that individually you don't have all the answers -- yet after conferring with others, you'll still need to move on to what's next."
libra,2011-04-03,"The exciting Aries New Moon falls in your 7th House of Partners today, symbolizing the potential for changing the direction of a current relationship or firing up a new one. This Sun-Moon conjunction opposes taskmaster Saturn, possibly delaying gratification or requiring you to work harder for what you want. Nevertheless, don't focus on all the reasons you should say no; make your move while you still can."
scorpio,2011-04-03,"If you were thinking about making radical changes to your daily routine, the day has finally arrived. But your actions don't have to be overly dramatic. The New Moon activates your 6th House of Details, suggesting that starting small is the smartest idea. Anything that adds to your efficiency is helpful. But don't wait until tomorrow; you need to do something right now to take advantage of this magical moment."
sagittarius,2011-04-03,"Your ongoing struggle now is about balancing work and play, yet the New Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Games currently emphasizes the lighter side of life. It's nearly impossible to be too serious, even if you have many obligations to fulfill. Don't sweat it if you leave a task unfinished or miss a deadline today. However, you still must pay attention to your previous commitments or life will quickly get complicated."
capricorn,2011-04-03,"You want to go on record with a straightforward statement about your feelings today, but it might be smarter to do this in private. You want everyone to understand you, yet it's more appropriate to only disclose this kind of information with the closest of friends and family. There's no need to rush now, so wait until you find the right person and place before sharing your darkest secrets."
aquarius,2011-04-03,"Today's brash Aries New Moon falls in your 3rd House of Communication, making nearly everything you say now seem more important than anything else. You are able to establish the tone for the changes ahead by writing about your goals, informing others about your perspective and even inspiring your friends and associates with your progressive plans. Don't wait for anyone else to take charge; state what's on your mind and then be ready to put your words into action."
pisces,2011-04-03,"You would be wise to utilize the powerful energy of the New Moon to concentrate your attention on your finances, for this Sun-Moon conjunction falls in your 2nd House of Money. However, its opposition with taskmaster Saturn reminds you that there's no free lunch. Hopefully you can implement an existing plan without taking any wild risks to increase your income. Just show up with a positive attitude and do what makes the most sense to create success."
aries,2011-04-04,"Marching in a brass band may be your idea of fun for a group or family outing today, because you really want to get everyone up and moving. Of course, you wish they would pay attention as you direct the show. But Mars is a close traveling companion with the Moon now, so you definitely need to soften your message. Music can soothe frayed nerves, yet it will probably be more effective to lower the volume so others don't cover their ears and miss out on what you are saying."
taurus,2011-04-04,"You aren't happy if someone bullies you, but defending yourself is likely a common event with your stubborn nature. Unfortunately, you may not be that comfortable handling this particular situation today. It's easier to hide your anger than to confront the origin of the problem. Keep in mind that this is not a cowardly act. Your self-restraint is wise now; otherwise you could lose control and create additional damage instead of leaving well enough alone."
gemini,2011-04-04,"You need to stay hyper-vigilant or your current intensity will appear overly aggressive to others. You might even think that you are being extremely logical today, only to have someone tell you that your ideas are impossible to follow. Instead of explaining every little detail, speak softer and say less. You really don't have to use that many words to get your point across. But you may have to wait until Mercury goes direct before you are completely understood."
cancer,2011-04-04,"You might surprise others with your ability to defend your choices today. You may be willing to listen, but once you've heard what someone else has to offer, your reaction can be strong and swift. Although you are more aware of others now, be careful about diluting the strength of your message by attempting to cover too much unfamiliar ground all at once."
leo,2011-04-04,"Putting your best ideas forward is not an alien concept to you, but today there is so much expressive energy floating around that you might not know when to stop. Your confidence tempts you to be so assertive that you can easily offend even your strongest allies. It will be much easier if you remember that dispersive Neptune's magnifying lens is making everything you say sound louder than it actually is. A laid-back approach will take you further now than an arrogant one."
virgo,2011-04-04,Interactions seem overly dramatic now that you are approaching a real turning point in your relationships. Someone's negative thoughts boil over and then everything becomes quiet. But don't mistake less noise for less intensity; it could be just the opposite. Don't allow yourself to feel so much anger that you say things you don't really mean. Withdraw your energy until you have regained your strength and composure.
libra,2011-04-04,"You are such a natural people-pleaser that sometimes you can be overly concerned with making everyone else happy. But you have six planets in your 7th House of Relationships today, indicating that you could blurt out something straight from your intuition without thinking about the impact of your words. Don't let anyone stand in your way; setting well-defined boundaries can assure healthier relationships in the future."
scorpio,2011-04-04,"Now that courageous Mars, your traditional planetary ruler, is in your 6th House of Employment, you are able to start new tasks at work. Unfortunately, follow-through will become a problem if you don't keep up your momentum. Once you slow down, you could lose track of your direction, so ask your friends and associates to either lend a helping hand or simply get out of your way."
sagittarius,2011-04-04,"Even if your current message sounds critical, don't expect others to share your concerns today. Although your friends know that you can wax philosophical, they still may become less patient as you enthusiastically ramble on about something that's significant only to you. Your ideas are flowing fast and furious now; it's hard to tell which ones are worth pursuing, so don't become too attached to any one thought until you see how it stands up to the test of time."
capricorn,2011-04-04,"You feel encouraged to wield your power today, but you could easily overdo it. The idea of proving your authority can be so enticing now that you may lose sight of your original intent. Success does not stem from being in control; reaching your goals is dependent on cooperation and innovation, and not hierarchy and tradition. Remember, the whole is greater than the sum of its individual parts."
aquarius,2011-04-04,"Positive thinking is a powerful force that can motivate others, but you might take it too far today. Blind optimism won't be of much use at all. If someone believes that you can't discern facts from fiction, there's a good chance that he or she will lose faith in your entire message. Muster support for your plan by being as realistic as possible. Everyone wants to hear good news, but it's even more important for you to tell the truth."
pisces,2011-04-04,"You're eager to create a new strategy for increasing your income with forceful Mars now traveling through your 2nd House of Money. You may have a lot of enterprising ideas about how to increase your cash flow, but aren't sure that any of them will actually work. However, dreamy Neptune's long-term presence in your sign can sap your confidence, so don't be afraid to ask for support from others. Relying on good advice from a trustworthy companion helps you determine a sensible course of action."
aries,2011-04-05,"Although you may feel a bit lazy now, you're still the one who quickly swings into action before considering the consequences. Often you can get away with overstepping your bounds, but your words have more impact on your friends and associates than you expect today. Exaggerating the facts or overselling your position won't help you convince others that your idea is a solid one. Since you cannot avoid the truth for long, you might as well keep it real from the very beginning."
taurus,2011-04-05,"Your need for simplicity is a prime motivator now that the Moon has returned to your sign. You may be able to positively impact a complex situation by changing only a very few basic variables. Don't try to pass yourself off as a master of details and nuance. Even if you wish that life wasn't so complicated, focus on the big picture and let the rest fall into place on its own."
gemini,2011-04-05,"You are often able to safely get away with talking about nearly anything that pops into your mind. Now, however, even the simplest comment can turn into a major disagreement. Almost everything you say today seems to be misunderstood or blown out of proportion. Avoid the temptation to prove everyone wrong; concentrate on cooperating with others rather than competing with them."
cancer,2011-04-05,"You are not looking for trouble today, yet it could find you when you least expect it. Although a dynamic situation at work may demand your immediate attention, you might still be highly resistant to any form of change. Fortunately, your friends appreciate your ability to quickly grasp the subtleties of a complex situation. Step up to the plate and take the lead, but remember there's no reason to make a big deal out of what you're doing."
leo,2011-04-05,"You could be caught between your confident head and your tender heart today, although you will most likely end up sweeping your emotions under the rug if you get the chance. You might think that rational thoughts are superior to feelings now, but logic doesn't have to override your love. Turn the battle for control into a spiritual practice by opening communication channels while seeking balance in your life."
virgo,2011-04-05,"Your ruling planet Mercury is mischievous while in his retrograde phase, and today he tricks you into thinking you are outrageously clever. Nevertheless, you cannot get away with talking your way around an obstacle. You must make a decision whether to move forward on your current path or if you want to consider a variety of alternatives that can change the course of your life. The time is now; make up your mind and follow your heart."
libra,2011-04-05,"It's challenging to find a healthy balance in your relationships now, for you may simultaneously be told yes and no every time you ask a simple question. You are willing to go over the edge in order to establish your limits, but it will still be tough to follow the rules. Being an artist is one way of testing the reaction of the world around you. The situation is not as desperate as you may think, so slow down, take your time and find your way."
scorpio,2011-04-05,"It may be easier for you to just show up and take control of the situation, if needed. Plot your course of action spontaneously today, rather than retreating to analyze a logical next step. Usually, you are the one who measures each and every thought, but now you're eager to jump before knowing if the pool is even filled with water. In your haste to act, don't try to detach yourself from your feelings, for they can still teach you quite a bit."
sagittarius,2011-04-05,"You are often so opinionated that you may inadvertently anger someone close to you. You're ready to share your feelings with everyone today because you believe that it is just simpler to tell the truth. Ironically, you can become a bit too evasive when it comes time for a heartfelt emotional interaction. There's nothing wrong with your desire to keep your feelings hidden as long as you continue to maintain your integrity."
capricorn,2011-04-05,"You might not be able to escape the responsibilities still being placed on you with your key planet Saturn in the picture. You may become frustrated in your struggle to keep up with all that's happening. However, you can shift the energy by simply agreeing to play according to the current rules of the game. You can regain your power when you acknowledge your limitations and stop taking on more than you can handle."
aquarius,2011-04-05,"You may have to manage certain domestic affairs now without anyone outside of your home knowing about your challenges. Although you have valid reasons to keep things to yourself, you're tempted to share personal information with an intimate friend or business partner. Broach a sensitive topic carefully, but don't wait until it's too late. Talk to a trustworthy companion today before the pressure makes a casual conversation impossible."
pisces,2011-04-05,"A kinder and gentler you is eagerly looking ahead, and yet your tone of voice might be forceful enough to scare someone away -- even if you're trying to bring him or her closer. It isn't any fun to upset someone you really like, yet you can avoid unpleasant consequences by being thoughtful and considerate in all your interactions. Moderation works in your favor now, so carefully understate whatever you choose to share today."
aries,2011-04-06,"The super-active Aries energy is over the top today and exuberant Jupiter's conjunction with the Sun in your sign gives you something to celebrate. Although it's the middle of the workweek, you might not be able to concentrate on your job responsibilities. You would rather spend your time lost in creative self-expression than finishing up what should have been done yesterday. As usual, your key to happiness depends on finding a middle ground between feeling free and meeting your obligations."
taurus,2011-04-06,"It's difficult for you to be satisfied with what you currently have because your imagination is so active that you see unlimited possibilities everywhere you turn. What makes this harder to manage today is that you cannot necessarily distinguish between the way things are and how they could be. Your fantasies are important now as long as you don't let them get the upper hand. Dream about the future, but remember that you must live in the present."
gemini,2011-04-06,"Although it's healthy to think your friends are worthy of great things, it's also important to be realistic. You may be expecting too much from social interactions in general today, which could lead to later disappointment. Expressing your hopes gives others a sense of what motivates you these days. But don't expect anyone else to share your enthusiasm for your pet projects. If something rocks your world, go for it. Don't wait for anyone else to champion your cause."
cancer,2011-04-06,"The good news you receive on the job today may not be totally unexpected, but it still can be quite exciting, nonetheless. Naturally, you will have hard work to do as you follow up on your end of the deal, but the most demanding tasks may already be done. Trust your hunches; you know what's coming next. Just don't get lazy until everything is really finished."
leo,2011-04-06,"It's hard not to get excited today about some upcoming event or getaway. However, if you are planning to travel, don't let your enthusiasm get the best of you. It's wonderful to be jazzed about going somewhere, but grandiose thinking could turn a realistic idea into a journey of the imagination. If you truly want to go on a meaningful adventure, avoid the temptations of bigger, better and more."
virgo,2011-04-06,"Although you might feel safer when navigating solo in rational realms, impulsive thoughts could quickly pull you into deeper emotional waters today. But instead of feeling vulnerable, your reaction now is to swing into action and do something about your current situation. Don't try to oversimplify things too quickly, for there's much for you to learn while exploring the exquisite complexities of relationships."
libra,2011-04-06,"Your interactions with others today can open a new window of opportunity. You may want to question the significance of this sudden turn of events, but logical analysis won't necessarily tell you what you need to know now. Stay open to your current experience without trying to classify it. Even if your first impulse is to retreat, save your final judgment until the excitement of the moment has worn off."
scorpio,2011-04-06,"Forget about your old habits and assumptions that have been holding you back. There's no need to process the same things you've been working on for such a long time. It's time to look ahead today, set a new course and begin doing exactly what will get you to your chosen destination. But don't try to do too much all at once. For now, it's all about big visions and little steps."
sagittarius,2011-04-06,"Your key planet Jupiter aligns with the Sun today in an annual event that indicates even more expansion and growth for you Archers. However, this year the conjunction activates your 5th House of Spontaneity, which is already crowded from an overload of planetary visitors. The bottom line is that your heightened sense of urgency about nearly everything in your life can provoke you to act without thinking about the consequences. Be smart and keep your eyes on the distant horizon."
capricorn,2011-04-06,"There are significant rumblings that are rattling your inner world now. Fortunately, you are being given glimpses of how your life could be if you redirect some of your career ambitions toward your personal life. Although this may be as straightforward as starting a home remodeling project, it could be a more subtle reminder that emotional growth is just as important to your overall happiness as professional success."
aquarius,2011-04-06,"Although this could be a very upbeat day, you might need to recognize the fact that you have too much information flooding your brain now. On a practical level, it's crazy just trying to keep up with everything that's going on. But the deeper lesson today is that more data doesn't necessary mean more knowledge. Instead of accumulating unnecessary facts, apply what you already know and see what happens."
pisces,2011-04-06,"There is a direct relationship today between feeling confident about yourself and wanting to buy something that reminds you of these good times. However, you would be wise to keep your credit cards in your wallet now because the excessive Sun-Jupiter conjunction in your 2nd House of Money could tempt you to spend more than you have on something you don't really need. Remember, self-esteem is not about material possessions; it's really about what's in your heart."
aries,2011-04-07,"You may believe that you know what you want today, but your emotions aren't as stable as you think. You might tell several very different stories throughout the day, which certainly could be confusing to others. Nevertheless, you try to explain yourself each time you change your mind. Unfortunately, your attempts to bridge the communication gap could just increase your loneliness and frustration. Saying less now is your best way to maintain clarity all the way around."
taurus,2011-04-07,"Someone at work may act unfriendly to you today and could hurt your feelings. As hard as you try, you don't understand why you deserve this cold shoulder. In fact, you may have done absolutely nothing to provoke this kind of rejection. Be patient and let the situation unfold on its own. Ultimately, you could discover that your angst stems from a misunderstanding and not an intentional slight."
gemini,2011-04-07,"You may be extra excited today as the Moon enters your jittery sign. Your ideas come and go so quickly now that you can't keep up with your own brain. Every thought seems like a stroke of brilliance, yet it's crucial to remind yourself that your perspective might be warped because communicator Mercury, your planetary ruler, is in retrograde motion. Enjoy your fantasies and explore your imagination, but don't assume that you can manifest your dreams in the real world so easily."
cancer,2011-04-07,"You may believe that others are unappreciative of you at work, but don't let this way of thinking turn into a journey of self-doubt. Once you begin to feel insecure or uncertain today, you might talk yourself into a grand funk. However, your fantasies can also carry you into new territory where anything is possible. Your attitude will make or break the day, so don't take criticism too personally. Focus on the positive side of life, instead."
leo,2011-04-07,"You may remember something that makes you quite serious today, but it's still easy to project a lighthearted attitude. However, your upbeat nature could complicate matters, especially if others think you're not taking things seriously enough. Meanwhile, you know you're not ignoring what's happening; you're just making a conscious choice about where to focus your attention. Keep in mind that the reaction of your friends is less important now than what you experience on your own."
virgo,2011-04-07,"It's challenging to stay on task today, especially if your work demands exacting concentration. Your ruling planet Mercury enjoys sorting out the details, but its current retrograde motion makes it more difficult to communicate what you are thinking. You still may need to maintain productivity, but don't be too hard on yourself if you fall short of your own expectations. Even Virgos need to take a break now and then."
libra,2011-04-07,"Your ruling planet Venus is like a love magnet, encouraging you to act sweetly to others while expecting the same in return. But, there is some tricky ground to cover today as the coolness of Saturn's restraint makes you feel as if you cannot show your true feelings. Don't just overcompensate by slipping into denial in order to turn an uncomfortable situation into something more pleasant. It's much smarter to work at improving the real world than escaping into a fictional one."
scorpio,2011-04-07,"Your emotions are out of whack now and you aren't sure how to get them back to where they belong. You may be feeling very spiritual and want to connect with your friends, but you aren't receiving positive responses to your overtures. You prefer a warmer reaction and without encouragement, you cannot keep expressing yourself in such a vulnerable way. Nevertheless, remember that it's not about how you are loved; it's about how you love that really matters."
sagittarius,2011-04-07,"You are naturally spontaneous and want to show others how to have fun today. Additionally, you are refreshingly upfront and could shatter people's expectations of how maturely you should act. However, being responsible might take a back seat to your wildly creative side now. Luckily, your competence enables you to handle things well enough that no one realizes you have escaped into the recesses of your own private universe."
capricorn,2011-04-07,"Self-discipline comes naturally to you, but not now when indulgent Venus tugs on your key planet, taskmaster Saturn. You might attempt to be somber, but you are having too much fun today. You don't see any harm in feeling joyful, even if your exuberance has nothing to do with your job. And, if you feel revitalized by doing something outside your normal comfort zone, you'll return to work even more ready to make a positive impact."
aquarius,2011-04-07,"It's nearly impossible to suppress your hope now, but you may be hard-pressed to wrap words around your current optimism. Don't worry about your inability to explain yourself today; the smartest thing you can do is to lead by example. Anyway, you'll be better able to share the process of your inner journey in a couple of weeks, and it should be well worth the wait."
pisces,2011-04-07,"You are swinging back and forth today, stretched between feeling overly confident and worrying yourself sick about the judgments of those around you. Unfortunately, it's probably more complicated than whether or not you are recognized for the contributions you make in a relationship or at work. Examine your assumptions about others before they get in the way of an otherwise perfect partnership."
aries,2011-04-08,"Although you may be tiring of the current hectic pace, this may not be the best day to get some rest. Slowing down sounds like a good idea now, but reality could still have a surprise or two in store for you today. Instead of attempting to avoid unexpected interactions or to minimize unscheduled events, embrace the interruptions because they can ultimately turn a boring day into an exciting one."
taurus,2011-04-08,"You may be expected to give a lot of yourself today without receiving much in return. Even if you derive personal satisfaction from your service to others, the day still could take its toll. You may feel that you aren't making much progress now, as if the tides are carrying you backward, but this is just a temporary effect of Mercury retrograde. Fortunately, you know something about patience. Don't give up; your persistence will be rewarded soon enough."
gemini,2011-04-08,"You may feel a bit frazzled now that the Moon is in your sign, simply because you know something that others don't and you cannot say a word about it yet. Maybe you made a promise to keep quiet or perhaps you just know that the current timing isn't quite right. For now, stick to your decision about what you will share and what you won't. Don't worry; everything is in the process of change, anyhow."
cancer,2011-04-08,"You may have more data at your fingertips than others realize, but you don't have to tell everyone everything that you know. Luckily, your current knowledge may be sufficient to answer a question, yet you still might be tempted to push your luck and try to uncover more. Instead of struggling on your own, be brave and ask for help if you need it."
leo,2011-04-08,"There really isn't any need to worry about what you must do today, for you are best off just being spontaneous. Although you can quickly become distracted by your friends, forget about entertaining everyone else for now. For once, just follow the course of least resistance, and let the magic of the day take you wherever it does."
virgo,2011-04-08,"Many of your friends and associates are looking to you for guidance during these intense times, even if you aren't interested in accepting a leadership role today. It's not that you are incapable of being a good manager; it's just that you might grow bored of trying to fulfill your obligations before the day is over. For a change of pace, cut yourself some slack and do something special just for you. Honestly, you can always pick up the pieces tomorrow."
libra,2011-04-08,"You may wonder if something is wrong with you today because the weekend is not even here yet and you're already planning for the next one. This might sound like a smart idea, but it makes it rather challenging to fully enjoy what is happening right under your nose. Reduce the pressure by acknowledging that there are many different ways to have fun. Relax and take time to smell the flowers."
scorpio,2011-04-08,"A thoroughly enjoyable encounter could morph into a romance or a long-lasting friendship as the flirty Gemini Moon aspects sweet Venus and talkative Mercury. But you must be willing to stand up and play your part in order to see where the relationship goes. If you don't make a concerted effort to connect with others in a deeper way when you're given the opportunity, then you'll never know where it might have taken you."
sagittarius,2011-04-08,"This may be a near perfect day if you're a fan of sports competition. It doesn't matter whether you are watching sports on television or actually participating in the games, yourself. However, if your interests are drawn somewhere else now, try to enjoy yourself thoroughly, whatever you choose to do. Keep in mind that you'll have more fun now if you are with new friends doing something you've never done before."
capricorn,2011-04-08,"It could be very grounding today to acknowledge a family tradition or a meaningful ritual from the past. You might impulsively decide to visit your parents or take a quick trip to see your kids. No matter what you plan, do things a little differently. You will feel more energetic if you don't do the same old routine again; instead, break up the drudgery with something that's a lot more fun."
aquarius,2011-04-08,"You may be worried that the weekend will come and go before you can finish what's already on your plate. Ignoring your ambitious plans by slipping into denial won't help you avoid what's ahead. However, it's probably more important to think about the present moment, instead of continually focusing your attention on the future. Scaling back your expectations now could give you extra time to relax and unwind."
pisces,2011-04-08,"Today's Gemini Moon complicates your life, yet it could also make your day more interesting. Even if you are sure about what you want, you might not know exactly how to get it. It's even harder now because your head says one thing while your heart tugs in another direction. Ultimately, you'll be happier if you let your conscience be your guide and do what feels right."
aries,2011-04-09,"Everything seems to be looking up now, but your positive attitude is being directly influenced by your fantasies. You know that there is more happening beneath the surface and you are curious about what isn't being said out loud. However, you may try taking the easy way out by denying your doubts and keeping any discomfort at an unconscious level. Although you might choose to be worry-free today, it's healthier in the long run to talk about your feelings rather than burying them."
taurus,2011-04-09,"You are better off if you initiate action sooner than later today -- while the Moon is still in your 2nd House of Values -- enabling you to verbalize your core beliefs. Making time to share your ideas with a trusted friend can open a door to a meaningful dialogue about what's most important to you. Unfortunately, if you procrastinate and don't have the conversation until later in the evening, you're likely to stir up petty jealousy in someone you love."
gemini,2011-04-09,"You may have to slow down in order to catch up with yourself today. You've been running at full speed and could be exhausted by the evening. You appear as if you are open to what others think now, but your mind may already be made up. If a friend confronts you about your beliefs, you could lose your temper. Be mindful and don't project your moodiness on anyone else now, just because you might be able to get away with it. Be honest and set clear boundaries for everyone's sakes."
cancer,2011-04-09,"Your day may seem rather chaotic as you run around juggling all your projects. Unfortunately, you might not be successful now, even if you finish almost everything you set out to do. If you take on too much, you could become anxious and the ensuing letdown may be difficult to handle. Being aware of your feelings should go a long way toward preventing an inappropriately intense emotional response to a relatively innocent question. Take a deep breath and think twice before opening your mouth."
leo,2011-04-09,"An unforeseeable event could temporarily topple you from the beautiful cloud upon which you were perched. Your vision of the future may crumble like a house of cards, suggesting that the day starts better than it ends. However, be careful about your assumptions, for today's emotional challenges can be harbingers for deeper intimacy. If you don't become caught in a web of insecurity, a more loving relationship is likely to develop."
virgo,2011-04-09,"Your drive to accomplish measurable results today gradually shifts as your mind is drawn to less pragmatic things this evening. You grow more concerned with larger issues of your life as the day progresses. Unfortunately, you don't have the luxury of being able to lose yourself in your thoughts as a disagreement brings you right back to the present moment. But don't take your annoyance out on others just because you wish you could still be daydreaming on your own."
libra,2011-04-09,"Although you may be dreaming about all the exotic places you want to travel and all the intriguing people you want to meet, you are running out of time. The weight of your unfulfilled commitments is quickly overtaking your other thoughts. This stress could lead to an argument because it's tempting to blame a friend or lover for your current circumstances. Even if you are unhappy with your life today, taking full responsibility for your situation is the quickest route to getting back on track."
scorpio,2011-04-09,"You have been pulled out of your natural habitat today, yet are able to quickly adapt by remembering a time when you were more comfortable. Later in the day, the tides shift, inspiring you to rediscover your misplaced connections with those around you. Unfortunately, things might not be as easy as you wish. Acknowledge where reality falls short of your expectations in such a way that relieves everyone else of being responsible for your happiness."
sagittarius,2011-04-09,"It may seem as if your friends' eagerness to follow your lead is more bluster than action, making it hard to trust their intentions now. Although you may appear out of character, you're fairly certain that others will just let you down. You grow more sullen throughout the day and may even pick a fight with someone you love in an attempt to express your frustration. Instead of taking your fears out on anyone else, look within for your answers."
capricorn,2011-04-09,"You feel like something profound is coming down the road and as much as you try to get out of the way, you cannot. Thankfully, physical harm isn't indicated, yet you may be confronted with the wide gulf between you and your loved ones now. This isn't the time to force a resolution between two people who respond very differently. Instead, stay aware of the feelings that arise, for they reveal where there is work still to be done."
aquarius,2011-04-09,"It's difficult to get much accomplished now, especially if you would rather be fantasizing about your future than handling real situations in the present moment. But the Moon's entry into your 6th House of Work this evening convinces you that tomorrow will be a much more productive day. And, astrologically, this just may be what happens. Nevertheless, some things must be completed today or you'll end up doing them under pressure."
pisces,2011-04-09,"You might think that you'll get away with hiding your feelings today, but your attempts may not be sufficient. Even if you sidestep a confusing situation early in the day, it's likely to swing back around and catch you off guard later. Don't stress too much if you are involved in an uncomfortable discussion. Instead of trying to emerge victorious in an argument, simply strive to find common ground or just smile and walk away."
aries,2011-04-10,"Don't mistakenly think that you cannot be strong and capable if you are also vulnerable enough to feel someone else's pain. You may incorrectly believe that you have to find a solution right away, while actually avoiding the problem, itself. An alternate approach, however, is to open your heart and experience the dilemma without trying to fix it. Today, the smartest thing you can do is to listen closely and acknowledge another person's feelings."
taurus,2011-04-10,"A close friend might bug you so much today that it feels as if he or she is picking a fight with you. But don't let a minor issue grow so important that it initiates an unnecessary argument and morphs into the turning point of your day. If you can successfully sidestep a confrontation now, you should be able to reap the fruits of your restraint when they ripen."
gemini,2011-04-10,"It's tricky for you to balance a very basic need for mental stimulation with today's intense desire to just chill out. It's not that your interest to be with others disappears now; it's simply that you don't want as many distractions as usual. If you are feeling overextended in any way, take time to recharge your batteries so you are up to the challenges of tomorrow."
cancer,2011-04-10,"It's as if an old friend has come for a visit now that the Moon has returned to your sign. She reminds you of the raw power of your emotions, yet also how isolated you can feel when you don't express them. It may be difficult to communicate your experiences today, for your responsibilities may prevent you from sinking into a more emotional zone. Remember, you can remain silent while still actively staying in touch with your inner world."
leo,2011-04-10,"You may feel hurt by someone you like today, making it hard to be honest. It's difficult to respond to what's happening, for you really don't want to show your weakness. Nevertheless, your vulnerability can indicate your true strength as it takes extra courage now to act on your gut instincts, even if they seem to be out of step with the circumstances of your life."
virgo,2011-04-10,"Being responsive today to someone you work with can prove to be an enriching experience, but you'll need to get over your insecurity about the possibility of being rejected. Sharing your feelings with your friends and associates can set you up for disappointment if others don't react as expected. Nevertheless, you'll never know what might have happened if you don't take the risk. Be willing to go to the edge without going over it."
libra,2011-04-10,"You might attempt to hide from the public eye today, yet you are needed by others in a way that could focus the attention directly on you. Oddly enough, it's not that you want to remain unseen; it's just that you feel awkward in the spotlight. Balance is one of your recurring issues; seek a comfortable place between being a star and remaining a complete unknown."
scorpio,2011-04-10,"You are able to see your distant goals quite clearly, but still may be at a temporary loss as to how you can safely reach your destination. Unfortunately, it seems as if there are no direct routes that lead to where you want to go now. Fortunately, you can draw on a very deep well of persistence. Your non-judgmental acceptance of those you love, combined with your willingness to wait for the right moment, will likely clear the way for your success."
sagittarius,2011-04-10,"Although it's always essential that you show up at work and do your job well, you are not completely satisfied with this option now. You want your creativity to overflow with passion. You hope to amaze others with what you can do. However, turning down the volume on your self-expression makes more sense today. It's better to sustain your productivity throughout the day than to create a flash of excitement by pulling a rabbit out of a hat and then declaring that you're done."
capricorn,2011-04-10,"You may be confronted with unclear messages now, with others saying one thing and doing another. Thankfully, you're encouraged by the loving support you are receiving, yet it feels as if something still isn't quite right. The unspoken judgment is that you're not doing enough, even if you have no idea of what else you could do. Don't let self-doubt creep into your life; motivate yourself by focusing on the positive feedback you are given today, instead."
aquarius,2011-04-10,"You are highly sensitive to what your closest friends want today, enabling you to take on tasks before they are even assigned to you. Unfortunately, you could also harbor resentment toward anyone who isn't willing to give you straightforward direction. You might not mind the extra work, but feel frustrated about the lack of acknowledgment and appreciation. But, instead of keeping your feelings quiet, talk to someone who is involved before your unhappiness gets the best of you."
pisces,2011-04-10,"You may feel more alive today, rejuvenated by the tidal Cancer Moon as she refreshes your pools of emotion. If you are trying to recover from a recent schedule overload, establish new boundaries while you still can. You won't have to give up any power, nor must you defend your right to remain silent. Quietly basking in the delicious healing waters of your own compassion is sufficient for now."
aries,2011-04-11,"You don't have to prove yourself to anyone today, though you may be concerned about a critic at work. You are ready to demonstrate your competence anyhow as combative Mars picks a fight with domineering Pluto. Passions are blown out of proportion when you meet powerful resistance. Even if it seems like someone is purposefully blocking your way, it's smarter to work with the energy instead of struggling to overpower it. Don't succumb to fear; you can reach your destination by following the high road."
taurus,2011-04-11,"It's challenging to manage your negativity today, but it should get easier as you gain awareness about what's really happening. A minor run-in with someone whose opinions are different from yours can stir unconscious memories. If your feelings aren't acknowledged, a minute molehill can turn into a volatile volcano. There's no need to let the pressure build to a breaking point. Avoid losing your temper by gently sharing what's on your mind without blaming anyone else."
gemini,2011-04-11,"You won't be happy today if your friends simply assume that you will just go along with everything they want to do. You may feel that they are being pushy and you don't appreciate it. Even if you don't want to make a big deal about what's happening, it may reach a point where you have no choice but to respond. Do your best to move through this uncomfortable situation by talking about your own fears, instead of attacking anyone else's behavior."
cancer,2011-04-11,"After attempting to disappear into the shadows, you realize that something has to happen now and it's up to you. Although you don't necessarily want to take charge, no one else may be capable of stepping up to the plate. Being the leader isn't the issue, but your passive-aggressive behavior could make matters worse. Remember, if you have a problem with someone's performance, saying it out loud can prevent your anger from hardening into resentment."
leo,2011-04-11,"You like playing the part of the good guy and are happy to focus your intentions on the best possible outcome. You may truly believe that this is the most intelligent strategy, but someone might think you are avoiding the facts. Ironically, you both could be right. However, if either of you attempts to prove your superiority, everyone will end up as a loser. Concentrate on creating common ground instead of tearing each other apart."
virgo,2011-04-11,"A playful conversation may turn into a rather serious argument today. What upsets you most is someone acting like a know-it-all, bending reality for an apparently selfish purpose. You don't have much tolerance for anyone who spouts facts that are blatantly untrue. Unfortunately, a fight to the finish could do more harm than good. It may be wiser to wait until everyone's emotions have settled down before continuing the discussion."
libra,2011-04-11,"Everywhere you go today, people seem to be confrontational and you don't like it. You might be tempted to place blame on everyone else, knowing full well that your intentions are good, no matter what. Unfortunately, circumstances may be more complicated than you realize, because your suppressed anger could be coming back at you in a projected form. Accept total responsibility for your own feelings, even the negative ones. This simple act of courage may be sufficient to begin calming the disruptive energy."
scorpio,2011-04-11,"If you haven't been following your exercise regimen, today's a good day to reinitiate it as your planetary rulers, muscleman Mars and formidable Pluto, cross paths to provoke action. Although you could feel deeply rooted emotions bubbling upward into your awareness, the edge of intensity can be softened through intense physical exertion. Channeling your energy positively by working out at the gym or dancing all night long can help to moderate your extreme point of view."
sagittarius,2011-04-11,"This may be a back-to-work day, but you still want to have your share of fun. Unfortunately, previous obligations will force you to reconsider your plans. You may not be very happy when you realize that a social event must go on without your attendance. Although you may be tempted, blaming others is not a sensible strategy to get what you want. This situation is a test of your maturity, so accept the current circumstances and rise to the challenge."
capricorn,2011-04-11,"If you lose your temper today it will become harder to get what you want. Unfortunately, you have been waiting for satisfaction and you have run out of patience now. Nevertheless, an explosive emotional outbreak will only turn your allies against you when you need them the most. Being honest and saying what you're thinking may be the right thing to do, yet compassionate behavior conveys your message more kindly."
aquarius,2011-04-11,"You may be too busy to stop and process your feelings today. Unfortunately, this can lead you down a difficult path as unexpressed emotions simmer beneath your awareness, turning a healthy reaction sour. Negative thoughts may be quietly lurking in the shadows, so take whatever time is needed to talk about your current frustrations. You might find yourself in the middle of a serious conflict if you don't adopt a proactive approach first."
pisces,2011-04-11,"You are often quite comfortable when feeling your way through a difficult situation without a rational anchor. However, today you might stubbornly choose to resist all forms of emotional engagement. Intuitively, you realize that there are struggles ahead and that it will be easier to avoid them than to confront the underlying issues. Unfortunately, there's no quick and easy way to sidestep the truth. Being honest now can be the key to receiving the support you want."
aries,2011-04-12,"It's easy for you to get a lot done today because the Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression harmonizes with your key planet Mars. You may be tempted to set aside work for a while in order to pursue pleasure, but it's probably not a good idea to trade your promises for immediate gratification. Don't try to shift the blame for your dilemma to anyone else. Just consider the consequences and do whatever makes the most sense in the long run."
taurus,2011-04-12,"Although you may not be able to avoid the weight of responsibility today, you are likely to be more concerned now with expressing your feelings than you are with doing your current job. Your romantic heart is in direct conflict with your practical head, distracting you from accomplishing the work at hand. Even if you feel driven, there's no need to take action right away. Allow your emotional stress to reach its crescendo and then subside before swinging into action."
gemini,2011-04-12,"Your workmates or friends can turn this into quite a busy day, and that's just how you like it. You are in top form and are able to show off your charm and wit as you flit from one activity to another. But strong desires are brewing just under the surface now, so don't bother wasting your energy on trivial matters. Keep something in reserve for when you will need it over the next few days."
cancer,2011-04-12,"Normally, you can be so sensitive to other people's emotions that it's often tough for you to take action. However, you're more likely now to respond immediately to a difficult situation at work than to adopt a wait-and-see approach. But don't overcompensate by being wildly impulsive; too much confidence leads to recklessness, which might create new problems faster than you can solve the old ones."
leo,2011-04-12,"You appear to be an open book today because the demonstrative Leo Moon is lighting up your 1st House of Personality. Although others may not recognize it, you're in touch with deeply rooted emotions that haven't reached the surface yet. Your thoughts carry even more weight because they are unspoken. After you share what's on your mind, the energy dissipates quickly. In the meantime, observe how others judge you without necessarily saying more than you must."
virgo,2011-04-12,"You don't want everyone to know your likes and dislikes, encouraging you to keep your preferences quiet. You can quickly rationalize hiding your desires by expressing your unwillingness to hurt someone else's feelings. However, it's more complicated than that today, for remaining silent about what you want contributes to the problem, not the solution. Find a way to talk about what you're feeling with enough sensitivity that you don't offend anyone else."
libra,2011-04-12,"You want to show your affection for your friends and associates, but you prefer to do it in an emotionally detached manner. This becomes more difficult once you start sharing your feelings because others are likely to be more responsive now than you ever anticipated. You will probably need to confront your own ambiguity, especially if someone reacts with great intensity. Although you're resistant at first, you'll feel better once everything is out in the open."
scorpio,2011-04-12,"You could surprise yourself today with the speed of your reaction to an event that is outside of your control. You say that you want to go with the flow, yet still have a hard time being flexible enough now with the Moon in fixed sign Leo. Surprisingly, most things should turn out okay if you are willing to step into this unknown territory, face the current issues one at a time and stay open to altering your overall course of action."
sagittarius,2011-04-12,"You may be enthralled by meeting your match as someone with lots of big ideas talks your head off today. You might wish that you could escape, but won't likely try very hard. No matter what you do, ungrounded philosophical conversations seem to follow you wherever you go. Thankfully, you can learn something very valuable from your interactions with others. Even if you feel overwhelmed with too many details, new information can widen your horizons in a way that you truly enjoy."
capricorn,2011-04-12,"Nothing is simple now; although you want to stick to the agenda today, you don't necessarily feel like following all the meandering ins and outs of a complex conversation. Uncharacteristically, you might prefer to jump around from topic to topic, or perhaps, you just delve within your daydreams, where no one else can find you. Don't judge others too harshly now. Remember, the tables are turned and this time you may be the one who's seeking the fun and resisting the work."
aquarius,2011-04-12,"Although you appear to be extremely flexible today, chances are good that your mind is made up and facts won't likely be a catalyst for change. Unfortunately, this rigidity can get you into deep trouble now. You gain nothing by letting yourself be governed by suppressed fears. Talking about your current apprehension with a close friend or partner is the smartest way to dissipate the negative energy before it creates real problems."
pisces,2011-04-12,"You want to impress everyone with how hard you work today, but you could struggle as you try to walk your talk. Unfortunately, your immediate needs may be in direct conflict with your distant goals, making it tough to know what to do next. This is a great time to quiet your mind and listen to your own intuition, instead of seeking answers from anyone else."
aries,2011-04-13,"It feels as if you're on an emotional seesaw because you have been up and down so often recently that it's difficult to see what's happening from a wider perspective. But your outlook is sunny and upbeat, even if there's nothing special happening today. Make use of your positive attitude now by jumping in and tackling problems while they don't seem so overwhelming."
taurus,2011-04-13,"You really don't have to show off by demonstrating how together you are today, for the very act of drawing attention to your security exposes your lack of it. While it's possible that your self-confidence has been vacillating lately, it's more important now to do something that makes you feel good, instead of trying to gain approval from others. Concentrate your attention on your rich inner world instead of placing undue significance on outside influences."
gemini,2011-04-13,"You should take extra precautions today because your life may be a whirlwind of activity. Although you typically like thrills and surprises, you could be caught off guard if you lack enough confidence now. Don't be distracted by every interesting thing that goes flying by. Maintain a soft focus, instead, since this allows you to stay balanced while you're still in motion."
cancer,2011-04-13,"It's stressful today trying to balance your time between work demands and domestic matters. But this current dilemma brings up a deeper issue about your fears of not being able to do it all. Although you might slide by now if you demonstrate how serious you are about doing a good job at home and on the job, this won't be helpful in the long run. The ultimate solution may require you to face your insecurities by talking about them with someone you trust."
leo,2011-04-13,"The Moon's current visit to your sign is emotionally intense, as your moods swing wildly like a pendulum out of control. However, you can continue to make steady progress by observing your feelings without necessarily saying anything about them at all. It isn't always easy to let the wisdom of your body react naturally, without an audience. Keep your feelings to yourself until things settle down in a day or two."
virgo,2011-04-13,"It may seem as if others are hiding important information from you, but you don't know what it is so there isn't any simple way to investigate without appearing to be paranoid. However, the more you ignore your current uneasiness, the louder it grows. Watch out, for you could end up creating a problem that was never there. Be totally upfront today; admitting that you are worried can help lessen your insecurities right away."
libra,2011-04-13,"Your interest in creating a relationship with a workmate may be piqued by a surprising conversation today. This probably isn't just a passing fancy; it's more likely the seed of an important journey ahead. In the meantime, plan something special for yourself that's not about work or about taking care of someone else. Think bigger than usual and act boldly. Taking a risk can prove to be more fun than you ever imagined."
scorpio,2011-04-13,"Managing details at work is a wise thing to do now that the Moon is in your 10th House of Career. Working quietly behind the scenes often has its benefits, yet today you actually need to feel appreciated. Unfortunately, trying to win approval from your superiors could end up being a waste of your valuable time. Your safest path to being noticed is simply doing your job to the best of your ability."
sagittarius,2011-04-13,"You don't need to withhold your enthusiasm today because your confidence will have a positive effect on your co-workers. At first, they might think that you're filled with hot air. But you're not promising more than you can deliver and your peers will become true believers when they see what you can do. Remember, your ultimate talent isn't in telling others what to do; it's the gift of joyfully leading by example."
capricorn,2011-04-13,"You may feel very close to someone special today without being physical at all -- intimacy comes in many flavors. Now, with the Moon illuminating your 8th House of Deep Sharing, consider how to enhance an interaction with a friend or family member by opening your heart. Simply expressing your fears with someone you trust will create a doorway to a more meaningful relationship."
aquarius,2011-04-13,"The self-expressive Leo Moon is visiting your 7th House of Partners today, cajoling you to reveal yourself through acts of generosity. But you still need to set clear boundaries by defining your limits or your magnanimous behavior could pull you overboard. Remember, you grow less believable when you overstate your case, so be quiet once you've made your point."
pisces,2011-04-13,"It's helpful to be able to count on something real today. Thankfully, the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Habits encourages you to lean on your familiar routine as a strong foundation. Regardless of how spaced-out or confused you might be feeling, it's crucial to go through the motions of whatever you do on a daily basis. However, this is not about playing your part mechanically or detaching yourself from your emotions; it's about reestablishing the meaning in your everyday life, instead."
aries,2011-04-14,"It doesn't matter that you're eager to take a risk and make something outrageous happen today; you probably won't get your crazy plans off the ground. Unfulfilled promises could restrain your behavior until you finish your current obligations. But don't let frustration get the upper hand, because having an emotional meltdown now will not add anything desirable to the quality of your life. Overcome your impatience and wait for a better moment to start something new."
taurus,2011-04-14,"Although you claim that you can work within the current limitations being placed on you, you cannot help but fantasize about your favorite escape. You understand that rebellious behavior won't necessarily bring the results you want, but you don't seem to have the control you need to keep things stable. Even if you want to blast your way out of the rut you are in, common sense should win out for now."
gemini,2011-04-14,"You must attend to personal matters today, even if you are simultaneously being pulled toward more public obligations. At first, it may seem as if your job will offer you some respite from your domestic responsibilities, but you would be smart to realize that you won't be able to escape from your family duties for too long. Don't try to outsmart your workmates by pretending to do your job. Be honest about your situation while sustaining your work pace the best you can."
cancer,2011-04-14,"You might become angry if someone at work pushes you too hard today. Your superiors may have inflated expectations, yet you know that there's only so much that you can handle now. Unfortunately, trouble arises if you don't establish clear limits. There's no need to complain about anything that is beyond your control, because that just makes the situation worse. It helps to be specific and let others know exactly what you can and cannot do before things get out of hand."
leo,2011-04-14,"You could run into an unexpected out-of-pocket expense today that reminds you of the instability of your current financial situation. However, it doesn't make sense to get discouraged now, even if you don't see how you're going to balance your incoming funds with your outgoing cash. Although a longer-term solution may take conscious effort, the immediate problem is temporary and should ease on its own in a couple of days."
virgo,2011-04-14,"You may feel as if you're being emotionally bounced around today, even with the Moon back in your practical Earth sign to help you focus your attention on what is most useful. But your day probably won't unfold according to your plans. Instead, you need to change your agenda several times to accommodate the shifting tides, which are beyond your control. Let go of your personal expectations so that you can transform a challenging day into one that's filled with pleasant surprises."
libra,2011-04-14,"Your friends and associates may not realize that you're having a tough time today because you're not telling anyone about your concerns. Ironically, your doubts could be greatly eased by the simple act of sharing them. Your fear of being criticized might be your biggest obstacle to opening up. But remaining silent and losing yourself in endless analysis won't lead to a logical resolution. You're better off by just blurting out the truth now. Although you may surprise someone with your radical perspective, an honest discussion should relieve the tension."
scorpio,2011-04-14,"There is so much happening today that you may not have time to make a sensible plan. Figuring things out on the fly will probably get you through the day unless someone questions your integrity, prompting you to defend yourself. Just remember that open conflict isn't a useful course of action; you would be smarter now to change your tactics and be less impulsive. Ultimately, you should be able to avoid an unnecessary argument by focusing on your goals and not on what anyone else says."
sagittarius,2011-04-14,"Although you're still interested in setting your work aside in favor of another enjoyable diversion, playtime is harder to justify today. Your professional responsibilities may be so demanding now that you just cannot get away with your planned escape. You might feel frustrated, but don't worry; the pressure won't last. Hunker down and do what's expected of you so you can feel free enough to relax later on."
capricorn,2011-04-14,"Your hard work might not pay off right away, but don't let that stop you from being extra conscientious about completing your job. It's not that others won't appreciate your contribution; it's just that they are so busy today that they may not stop to acknowledge you. Don't lose your focus worrying about being noticed. If you're patient, your just rewards will arrive soon enough."
aquarius,2011-04-14,"Extra stress may come from financial institutions, investments or partnerships today, and there might not be an obvious way to avoid it. However, don't put off any banking business that should be handled; starting sooner than later can make a big difference. Money management may not be a lot of fun, but handling complicated business affairs now can increase your sense of security and will help you feel more at ease."
pisces,2011-04-14,Interactions with someone who can exert control over your life may not go as smoothly as you hoped. You would be a lot more willing to acknowledge another person's authority if he or she actually deserves your respect. But it's challenging to acquiesce to anyone who assumes power without earning it. Don't be afraid to stand up for your convictions. You will only have to face the same issue again if you back down now for the sake of convenience.
aries,2011-04-15,"Your workmates may be extra critical of your actions as the picky Virgo Moon visits your 6th House of Details today. However, you're not in the mood to change your behavior just to placate someone else. Perhaps you are being judged unfairly, but you would still be wise to consider how to address their concerns before you completely shut them out. This could be a significant opportunity for you to improve your game, rather than complaining about others who don't appreciate what you do."
taurus,2011-04-15,"You might actually be able to finish your work because you are not as likely to be distracted today. Although you could still be a bit scattered in your thinking, it's helpful that your friends who often tempt you to leave your responsibilities now have a lot to do themselves. If you are ahead of schedule now, don't get lazy. You can accomplish more than you expect if you simply keep going at a steady pace."
gemini,2011-04-15,"You may be revisiting childhood memories with more clarity than usual, and this could be a pleasant distraction from what you should be doing. However, your little excursions into your personal history might reawaken emotions from the past. Analyze your feelings so you know which ones are significant enough to motivate new action. This process will take practice, but, fortunately, you can learn to keep up external appearances now while you also attend to your journey within."
cancer,2011-04-15,"You are the most productive when your new ideas are reinforcing your professional goals. The smart Virgo Moon is thinking her way through your 3rd House of Communication, elevating your confidence and reminding you that you are on the right track. There isn't any hurry now, because, thankfully, your current plan should solidify in the next week or two."
leo,2011-04-15,"Take inventory of what you have recently accomplished so you can raise things to the next level without making yourself much busier than you already are. Stabilizing your financial and social networks enables you to maintain a higher level of creativity now. Remember, you don't have to expend more energy; gain efficiency and consistency by acting smarter in everything you do."
virgo,2011-04-15,"The Moon's visit to dutiful Virgo is a mixed blessing now. On one hand, you aspire toward quality in your work and in your relationships. Fortunately, sound data allows you to think clearly and make wise decisions. On the other hand, the Moon emphasizes your subjective feelings, which can have you reconsidering a recent decision. Listening to both your head and your heart will lead to the best of both worlds."
libra,2011-04-15,"You still have a day or two to finish up old business before the Moon returns to your sign and initiates a brand new cycle. This isn't the smartest time to start a project -- you are much better off focusing on finishing an old one. However, it's not enough now to just meet your obligations with efficiency. There are lots of possibilities before you; take the one that also incorporates elements of grace and beauty."
scorpio,2011-04-15,"The Moon in your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams can draw your attention into the future as if it were today. But you must not lose sight of your position and what you have on your plate right now. You must find a harmonious balance between your ideal vision and your current everyday reality. Thankfully, you will know that you're on the right path when you can hold your dreams in awareness, even when you are awake."
sagittarius,2011-04-15,"Grandiose ideas and extravagant plans may come naturally to you, but today's detail-oriented Virgo Moon in your 10th House of Career requires you to place limits on yourself. However, no one will be able to do this for you; it must come from within. Rather than looking out at every distant horizon, focus on what is directly in front of you."
capricorn,2011-04-15,"Everyone's seeking you out today because it appears that you can plan events, solidify projects or simply determine the best way to get a job done. Your mind may be able to cut through the myriad of details, enabling you to make crucial decisions about what is important and what is not. But it's not constructive to become overly detached from your feelings. Bring compassion into your process, for it can make the difference between just getting by and stunning others with your sincerity."
aquarius,2011-04-15,"You become uncomfortable today if someone brings up a touchy emotional issue that you cannot easily avoid. Ironically, your current attempts to sidestep a difficult discussion can actually be harder than just breathing deeply and jumping in. Even if you are overwhelmed by complex emotions, listen closely to what others say and then express what you feel. You should come out of this situation with a renewed appreciation for life."
pisces,2011-04-15,"The Moon's activation of your 7th House of Partnerships shifts the focus away from you and puts it on others with whom you work and play. Unfortunately, they may be less inclined to join in your dreams and fantasies now, which can be disheartening for you. But don't blame anyone else for your discomfort; instead, take a bit of time and gently nurture those parts of yourself that remain unappreciated."
aries,2011-04-16,"Making decisions may be very difficult today because you want to take the feelings of everyone else into consideration prior to initiating action. As certain as you are about your desires, you may be unsure of the timing. Even if something doesn't seem right, you might think you don't have the option of waiting. Stop to consider your choices and postpone your final decision until after Mercury turns direct on the 23rd."
taurus,2011-04-16,"You may be hung up on the details of your chores today, which can prevent you from starting them. Usually, your style is to take your tasks one at a time and just plow through them. However, now you might not be able to decide where to begin. Unfortunately, procrastination is not a smart strategy because the longer you put off the inevitable, the harder it gets. Be courageous and jump in anywhere you can; things will proceed more easily once you are making some progress."
gemini,2011-04-16,"You might believe that you'll have fun while running errands or doing your chores today, but you'll probably need to work harder than you prefer to overcome the obstacles you encounter along the way. You could even think that someone is purposefully blocking your progress, but don't jump to any hasty conclusions before you have sufficient facts to support your concerns. It's wiser to work toward accomplishing your goals, rather than wasting time rationalizing why you shouldn't even bother."
cancer,2011-04-16,"It's easier for you to get along with others when you can see a complex issue from all angles. Although you may not have an easy answer, you could be the right person to mediate a serious domestic conflict today if you don't take sides. Unfortunately, the picture can grow more complicated if you feel pressured to decide on the best course of action. Don't be afraid to establish strong boundaries by letting everyone know that you'll share your preferences when you are ready."
leo,2011-04-16,"You would like to consider everyone's perspective before revealing what you're going to do. Unfortunately, you might need to make a critical decision today that ends up offending someone, even if you do your best to accommodate the needs of others. Don't believe your own illusions about being able to agree with each person involved. Be as kind as possible while explaining your choice and then take care of your business the best you can."
virgo,2011-04-16,"Your intelligence is apparent today when you build on what you've already started, rather than beginning something new. However, you could face your own internal resistance before taking your work to the next level. Although your fear of failure might make you think that your efforts will go unnoticed, this isn't the right time to overanalyze what you are doing. Just stay on the course that you recently chose. You may be progressing faster than you now realize."
libra,2011-04-16,"You might feel on edge today with the Moon back in your sign. You don't have a lot of patience with others who act selfishly, but it's awkward to tell them what they should already know. However, it's a mistake to keep your annoyance to yourself in order to maintain the peace because there could be an emotional price to pay when you don't express yourself. Fortunately, with a little social finesse, you should be able to remain authentic without placing blame on anyone else."
scorpio,2011-04-16,"Every little task seems more complicated when you cannot make up your mind about basic issues. Ironically, the facts seem clear, yet you're struggling with a dilemma as your imagination pulls you in opposite directions today. Unfortunately, your refusal to give up on either side prevents you from making the best choice. Thankfully, you should be able to wait out your uncertainty until the answer becomes more apparent."
sagittarius,2011-04-16,"Expressing your feelings honestly sounds like a smart idea, but a declaration of love today may not go over very well. Writing about your heart's desire in an email or text won't necessarily fare any better. Somber Saturn's influence can bend your emotions out of shape, so you might not have a very clear perspective, even if you think you do. Only fools rush in; be smart and wait a few days before saying what's on your mind."
capricorn,2011-04-16,"You may have to play the role of the bad guy in a family conflict today. Or, perhaps others are in need of your parenting skills. You, on the other hand, are more interested in holding a neutral position while you listen to everyone's concerns. Even if you've had enough of other people's neediness, you don't have the luxury of being able to let your attention wander. Focus on what's being said and then speak from your heart."
aquarius,2011-04-16,"You have things to do today that you've never done before, but fortunately, you like figuring out new experiences. Luckily, you have a knack for balancing the known with the unknown. However, you still have to exercise caution or you could become lackadaisical in your approach. There's little margin for error, so don't get lazy. Lowering your guard now is a sure invitation to trouble."
pisces,2011-04-16,"You are sensitive enough to handle the deep emotions of those around you, but you may be on a seesaw today as you try to balance someone else's feelings with yours. You truly want to be present for those you love, but you're hesitant to open yourself up to outside negativity now. The real lesson is about overcoming your fears; showing your vulnerability could reinvigorate an existing relationship or initiate a new one."
aries,2011-04-17,"The logical Libra Full Moon acts like a mirror today, allowing you to perceive yourself more clearly. But it's hard to describe what you see, for Mercury the Communicator is still retrograde in your sign, muddling the meaning of what you say. Thankfully, your persistence should pay off. Don't fret if your message isn't getting through now. Instead, take a deep breath, gather your thoughts, and then try again."
taurus,2011-04-17,"You want all the details of the day to fall in place and flow smoothly, yet something seems a bit off. Even if you understand that it may be wise to keep your discomfort to yourself, you also worry that the opportunity for improvement could fade if you don't speak up right now. Nevertheless, it's smarter to smile and save your words for another day when others will be more receptive to your feedback."
gemini,2011-04-17,"You don't want to stir up any trouble today, especially if your shenanigans could lessen your opportunities for pleasure. The Full Moon in your 5th House of Play enables you to get away with mischief because your friends will enjoy being around you even more than usual now. But don't overplay your hand or they will see through your charm and might be annoyed that you are avoiding the real issues. Rather than simply seeking a good time, balance your lighthearted spirit with a more serious approach to life."
cancer,2011-04-17,"Today's strategic Libra Full Moon in your 4th House of Home and Family triggers familiar issues about lingering insecurities. You might choose to distract your attention from a vulnerable spot by starting a new project around the house. You could even be so effective with this tactic that you alleviate the tension for a while. But you cannot escape completely and the sooner you face your emotions, the sooner everyone will begin to feel better."
leo,2011-04-17,"You are motivated by your need to know what's going on with a friend today. Simultaneously, you may become so preoccupied with an impractical idea that it can turn into an obsession. However, your desire for a bit of adventure may leave you little time to get involved with someone else's drama. Try to relate what you are now learning about yourself to the goals you are attempting to reach."
virgo,2011-04-17,"Money issues are emphasized now as today's Libra Full Moon highlights your 2nd House of Finances. You may try to balance your current desires with your available funds and discover you're not in any position to buy something you don't really need. You could also realize that your old values are out of sync with what you want to do now. There's no hurry, so step slowly into your future. If you move at your own pace, you can regain fiscal integrity sooner than you think."
libra,2011-04-17,"Getting along nicely with others is more difficult than usual today because the pleasure-seeking Libra Full Moon activates several combative Aries planets. It might be more enjoyable if there was someone special with whom you could share your experience. However, you may not have the patience to cultivate open communication. Don't lose hope; you could be in for a sweet surprise when you least expect it."
scorpio,2011-04-17,"Today's gentle Libra Full Moon adds an emotional charge to your 12th House of Imagination, yet can also prevent you from reaching satisfaction. You might be very certain about the intimacy you are currently seeking, but the opportunity seems to dissipate upon closer analysis. Don't force any decisions prematurely. If you take the time to talk about what you want, the right person may be eager to follow your lead."
sagittarius,2011-04-17,"You might place such inflated expectations on your friends today that you just assume they will come through for you. Although they might actually meet your high standards, the Full Moon in your 11th House of Groups is opposite the Sun in your 5th House of Creativity, enabling you to have more fun now when you actively pursue your own self-interests. Concentrate on expressing yourself instead of worrying about others."
capricorn,2011-04-17,"You know what you must do today in order to come through for those who depend on you. You can focus your mind on whatever must happen to make your dreams come true. Tread lightly; if you get overly cocky, your current little scheme could backfire and leave you with a messy situation. Your best contribution now is your honest commitment to be as present as possible when interacting with others."
aquarius,2011-04-17,"You may enjoy imagining how you will live in the future, but your daydreaming might be distracting to others. However, today's balancing Libra Full Moon in your 9th House of Adventure reminds you to keep a foot in the future while stabilizing the other one in the here and now. Widening your perspective enables you to maintain your unflagging vision for a better tomorrow while avoiding unrealistic idealism in the process."
pisces,2011-04-17,"Your current dilemma is striking a workable balance between simplicity and complexity. You may desire the creature comforts of being in a relationship, but you might not want to pay the emotional price. To avoid complications later on, consider the consequences of your unrestrained ambitions. Be smart and set aside some personal desires in the name of the higher cause of love."
aries,2011-04-18,"You may attempt to take a shortcut today, hoping that no one will notice. Luckily, you are clever enough to fool others with your scheme, but only for a little while. Unfortunately, outmaneuvering reality by trying to control the situation won't work for you now. A smarter approach would be to temper your over-the-top story with a healthy dose of pragmatism before you end up looking foolish."
taurus,2011-04-18,"You may not be feeling overly optimistic today, but it's a smart strategy to fake an air of confidence anyway. You could receive recognition now for your ability to see the potential in a situation and to rally others to your cause. But don't exaggerate your ideas, or you'll lose support when it becomes obvious that you cannot fulfill all your big promises. It's more advantageous now to offer less and deliver more than anyone expects."
gemini,2011-04-18,"If you have been carried away recently by your own grand ideas, your optimism could be a problem. You're able to sell blue sky and rainbows to others, even if they actually remain out of reach. Unfortunately, your hard work won't be enough now to make all your dreams come true. Instead of creating impossible expectations, just quietly apply yourself the best you can toward manifesting the future as you see it."
cancer,2011-04-18,"You may be hesitant to say what's on your mind today, because you don't want to rain on everyone's parade. Although you might not be the one to deliver the bad news, you aren't fooled by all the people who are admiring the Emperor's new suit of clothes. Rather than playing the role of the naysayer now, it may be smarter to just keep quiet. Don't waste your energy arguing with those who cannot see what's truly happening."
leo,2011-04-18,"The Moon is brightening your sensitive 4th House of Home and Family today, reminding you that your current negativity can actually influence your point of view. Others might appear very positive about what's going on, even if you are questioning their authority. However, you don't have to fall prey to grandiose thinking. Do the intelligent thing and trust your own analysis over someone else's hopeful dreams."
virgo,2011-04-18,"You can turn one thought into a whole philosophical treatise today. However, you're capable of rationalizing nearly anything, which makes you a very effective negotiator. Unfortunately, it's hard to see the negative side of a situation now until it's too late. Don't hold on to an idea any longer if you know that it doesn't make sense. You can waste valuable time and significant energy if you are too rigid in your approach."
libra,2011-04-18,"You might not be all that upbeat today, even if you can visualize the great opportunities ahead. But you are highly realistic now, enabling you to also see all the potential problems. Relax and don't struggle too much to overcome your current self-doubt. Thankfully, your negativity will dissipate before your fears can even manifest."
scorpio,2011-04-18,"Although you can be masterful enough today to find a solution to the knottiest of problems, the Moon in your secretive sign urges you to keep your intentions quiet. Instead of calling attention to yourself, jump in and just do your share of the work. If your plan is successful, you can confidently tell others about your idea with a real sense of authority, rather than waving a flag while you're still unsure about what you're doing."
sagittarius,2011-04-18,"It's challenging to be practical today because of your high level of enthusiasm. You are quite sure that you can pull off nearly anything you put your mind to now. But you may have a rude awakening if you take on more than you can handle. Unfortunately, you might have to put in a superhuman effort to meet your current obligations, instead of falling short of your promises. Ultimately, it's best to avoid making too many commitments in the first place."
capricorn,2011-04-18,"Someone else's tactics could clash with yours today, yet it still isn't a good idea to turn a minor disagreement into a major argument. Even if your strategy is better, open conflict will not create the opportunity you seek; it will only add obstacles to your progress. Aggressive behavior won't work in your favor, either. Demonstrate your competence by retreating quietly, upgrading your plan and then trying again when everyone is ready to listen."
aquarius,2011-04-18,"You might try to convince someone that you're right by sharing your positive outlook and making bold assertions today. But your enthusiasm is not a substitute for the work required to reach your ambitious goals. If you haven't aimed too high, you should be able to overcome any resistance you encounter, but don't expect immediate results. Success could take more time and effort than you thought."
pisces,2011-04-18,"You are motivated to accomplish a lot today, yet it might not be easy to sustain your efforts. Even if you begin to feel worn out, you can reach into your deep spiritual well for the inspiration you need to keep going. Sometimes, you lose hope when you run into apparently insurmountable obstacles. But now you are eager to work hard and show the world what you're made of. Have faith and let your light shine for everyone to see."
aries,2011-04-19,"Although you may have to face a deep-rooted fear, you're willing to discuss a difficult issue today. Unfortunately, your good intentions don't necessarily mean that you'll get to the heart of the matter. Your goal is admirable, but you can appear so thoroughly engaged in the conversation that no one notices you're just putting up a smokescreen to prevent others from getting past your defensive shell. Share your truth with someone you trust to avoid feeling isolated."
taurus,2011-04-19,"Your co-workers and friends can be too intense for your taste today, but you can't just ignore them. Your sense of loyalty enables you to interact with others on equal footing, but your dissatisfaction grows until you suddenly say what's on your mind. Don't be too hard on yourself for your emotional outburst; it's healthier to get your feelings out into the open sooner than later."
gemini,2011-04-19,"You can surprise others with your unflappable determination today, and could do such a good job that they cannot help but take notice of you. Meanwhile, you might be secretly trying to avoid the spotlight now, tempting you to give out mixed messages. Although your key planet Mercury is receiving an energetic boost from Mars, it's really not about what you say; it's more about what you're not saying. Think twice prior to hiding something you might be better off sharing."
cancer,2011-04-19,"Your need for a deep emotional attachment is magnified today by the Moon's visit to passionate Scorpio. However, you might try to cover up your vulnerability by confronting someone about something that's completely unrelated. Fortunately, sharing a romantic inclination can open up new avenues of communication. But don't push too hard; for now, find satisfaction with whatever happens."
leo,2011-04-19,"You could be more self-protective now than anyone realizes, but your social veneer makes it look like you're fully engaged in your relationships. People close to you may be impressed with your optimistic demeanor, however, you may be reliving unexpressed hurt that continues to be recycled in your life. For now, there's no reason to change your behavior; it's okay to dance between two positions. Thankfully, you will be able to meld these disparate realities with time."
virgo,2011-04-19,"You prefer that no one messes with your schedule today because you know exactly what should be done and just want to get on with it. You aren't happy wasting any time having to explain yourself to others. Nevertheless, it isn't smart to alienate your friends and family. Seek ways to maintain your focus without cutting yourself off from the love and support that's available to you now."
libra,2011-04-19,"Sometimes you are so gracious that you can appear more easygoing than you actually feel. However, today you're feeling uncharacteristically selfish. It isn't that you are antisocial; it's just that you don't want to put up a phony front for the sake of making others feel better. Don't try to justify your actions; just be true to yourself while remaining kind to everyone else."
scorpio,2011-04-19,"It can be rather challenging to deal with your own powerful emotions now that the Moon is back in formidable Scorpio. Thankfully, you can transform your difficult feelings into a vision of hope. Sharing your dreams for the future can be quite inspiring to others, which in turn ultimately improves your mood by making you feel more positive about yourself."
sagittarius,2011-04-19,"Today's Sun-Mercury conjunction falls in your 5th House of Self-Expression, inspiring you to use your motivational gifts. Although your words often help others to be more confident, your over-the-top exuberance now could also be a bit intimidating. There's no need to drive your point home with extra intensity; just share your perspective and then give your friends and associates enough space so they can assimilate the possibilities at their own pace."
capricorn,2011-04-19,"Acknowledging your extreme reactions to your friends can actually improve your relationships with them, while hiding your feelings could create unnecessary tension. Fortunately, a solid friendship will almost always withstand the truth. Don't withhold what's on your mind today; ultimately, your good intentions will prevail over the temptation to rationalize away your integrity."
aquarius,2011-04-19,"Passing the time with your co-workers or friends today can be an uplifting and motivational experience. Although there could be a few tricky turns to the conversation, the process of sharing may be exactly what you need to overcome your current negativity, especially if you have recently slipped into a bit of a slump. But this isn't about being logical; you don't need to justify anything now. Just open your mind and bask in the camaraderie of your peers."
pisces,2011-04-19,"Your empathy can be one of your greatest strengths; however, it may also be a source of your current anxiety. Being sensitive to other people's needs is a blessing unless you can't set healthy boundaries and turn it off when appropriate. Even if your intentions are good, feeling pain that's not yours isn't always helpful. Try to remain positive and then move on; emotional detachment can be liberating to all."
aries,2011-04-20,"You've been going at full throttle for a while, but it's finally time to slow down and enjoy what you've accomplished. However, this won't be as easy as it sounds, even with the Sun's move into earthy Taurus today. You may be more determined now to relax, but there's still a pile of planets clustered in fiery Aries, so don't judge yourself too harshly if it still takes a while for your energy to settle down."
taurus,2011-04-20,"The Sun returns to your sign today, boosting your energy and restoring your confidence in your ability to finish whatever you start. But as your rigidity increases, you also realize the inadequacy of your current strategy. Being aware of your limitations is just as important as believing you can do anything. A familiarity with your shortcomings can be an asset, but your chances for success will be improved by concentrating primarily on your strengths."
gemini,2011-04-20,"Your key planet Mercury nears the end of its retrograde phase, yet runs into a bit of trouble today when it opposes powerful Saturn, blocking your regular avenues of communication. Someone may appear to be working against you, but, luckily, you have the patience to sort out everything. If you can tighten your logic, you should be able to make your case effectively. When the time comes, don't embellish your presentation; the facts will tell the story well enough on their own."
cancer,2011-04-20,"You may already believe that your life will get easier for you, even if you aren't fully ready to trust your intuition. The Sun's entry into your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes can shine a new light on what makes you happy. Instead of having to fight for your ideas, you are entering a phase when your peers will stand behind you. Don't let old fears sabotage your endeavors. Have a little faith in your friends and graciously accept their support when they offer it."
leo,2011-04-20,"You may be confronted today by someone who threatens your status. Unfortunately, this conflict could turn sour, even if you did nothing wrong. Obviously, you don't have to admit that you were at fault, only that you're sorry to have made the situation any worse. A heartfelt apology can clear the air and free everyone to move on."
virgo,2011-04-20,"You might think you have a smarter idea for nearly everything today, but that doesn't mean your way is really the best course of action. Unfortunately, you could be so sure of yourself now that you'll take on anyone who disagrees with your plan. Thankfully, you should come to your senses before an argument reaches the point of no return. In a fight to the finish, there will be no winners, so find common ground and build a consensus from that point on."
libra,2011-04-20,"You are feeling a bit spacey now and even though you have some interesting and creative ideas, it's difficult for you to express them. Normally, you're able to maintain a healthy perspective, but today you could grow obsessive by trying too hard to make your point. It's counterproductive to worry about what others think. Just share what's on your mind and then let it go."
scorpio,2011-04-20,"A discussion could escalate into a power struggle today, even if your intention is to return to simplicity. The Sun's entry into placid Taurus lures you into believing the disarming illusion that relationships can always be bucolic. But conflict may return when you remember that you're not interested in compromising your zest for life. Passion is still more important to you than comfort alone."
sagittarius,2011-04-20,"Conversations with co-workers can blow someone's feelings out of proportion today, adding plenty of confusion to the situation. The more you try to talk it out, the more complicated it becomes. Part of the problem is that it's easy to make broad sweeping statements that are based upon generalities. Instead, be picky and stick to the details. The more specific you can be now, the less time it will take to resolve the current misunderstanding."
capricorn,2011-04-20,"You feel your strength returning and are eager to be productive, even if there are tricky communication issues that need to be managed today. You might be inclined to jump in and tackle a problem directly, but this isn't the best approach now. Your compulsive need to gain closure on an emotional issue may warp your perspective, so wait for your clarity to return before saying something you'll regret."
aquarius,2011-04-20,"You may have thoughts that seem so astounding today you cannot let go of them. But you might be afraid to share your ideas for fear that others will steal them from you. Your current paranoia isn't likely based on what's happening now, but rather on a memory about someone once getting credit for what you did. Reframing old disappointments is part of a therapeutic process, as long as you're willing to acknowledge the difference between the past and the present."
pisces,2011-04-20,"Your fantasies seem larger than life today, yet there's little chance that you'll get lost in them because the practical Taurus Sun keeps you firmly grounded. Listen closely to your intuition, as knowledge is revealed through the practice of meditation, yoga and other relaxation techniques. But this inward focus can be a waste of time unless you follow through in the outer realms, too. Once you are clear about your goals, you'll have a better idea of what to do next."
aries,2011-04-21,"The good news is that Venus, the planet of love, is now visiting your sign until May 15, improving your chances to receive more pleasure and wealth. However, you must be careful about overindulging or overspending when you seek sensual and material gratification. You still need to mitigate any tension that is created in the pursuit of your idyllic visions. Don't be discouraged if it takes longer than you wish to reach your dreams."
taurus,2011-04-21,"You are moving into a phase when your fantasies can lead you down new avenues of exploration. Beautiful Venus is now in your 12th House of Imagination, activating dreams that can break you out of your old habitual desires. Remember, you don't have to materialize every flight of fancy. Just acknowledge the opportunity to widen your horizons as you consider roads previously not taken."
gemini,2011-04-21,"Although you may still be working through a few self-imposed limitations, you're on the verge of transforming how you relate to your friends. Your new way of interacting with others brings refreshing waves of change to your relationships and social life. However, everything you do has consequences, so keep in mind that your easygoing style may not be interpreted as all fun and games by someone else. Instead of assuming that everyone is on the same wavelength, take the time to check in with those close to you."
cancer,2011-04-21,"It's wonderful if amicable Venus in your 10th House of Career makes your job more enjoyable over the next few weeks. But her public position in your chart can create anxiety as you are now pulled outside of your safety zone. Fortunately, moving beyond your comfortable limits should be less stressful than you expect; in fact, you could be rewarded for your courage if you are willing to take a chance."
leo,2011-04-21,"Thankfully, the sky clears today, leaving you with an unobstructed view of what's possible. Your imagination is vivid, allowing you to see your life the way you want it to be, rather than limiting your vision to the way things are now. This newfound perspective enables you to set lofty goals and, fortunately, with a lot of persistence and a little luck, your chances of reaching them are quite good."
virgo,2011-04-21,"You could be at an emotional tipping point now as you balance on the edge of a feeling that is both attractive and frightening. Although someone or something can awaken your interest, it may be too early to respond openly. Exercising caution is a good idea while Venus is in your 8th House of Intimacy, especially if your excitement causes you to lose objectivity. Move slowly before jumping in with both feet."
libra,2011-04-21,"Your ruling planet Venus is in your 7th House of Others for the next few weeks and this should have a positive impact on your partnerships. A new situation seems to inspire your creativity and playfulness, which in turn makes you more attractive to others. Be willing to entertain business or personal relationship possibilities that you would normally pass by. Most importantly, don't be afraid to enjoy yourself now while you can."
scorpio,2011-04-21,"Venus enters your 6th House of Work today, enticing you to get down to the nuts and bolts of what makes your life function most effectively. Practicing self-restraint often helps you avoid an awkward social situation, but now charming Venus in spontaneous Aries can push you to take action, instead. How you manage this impulsive energy over the next few weeks is up to you, but don't forget that depth and intensity is required in any relationship or you'll lose interest very quickly."
sagittarius,2011-04-21,"Your feelings about a special friend or lover are quite straightforward, but if you freely express your emotions it will definitely increase the complexity of the interpersonal dynamics. You might think you can just play it cool today, but the Moon in your sign makes it challenging to remain on the sidelines when your desires are stirred. Still, it's a smart idea to consider the consequences of your actions before you make any moves."
capricorn,2011-04-21,"You may believe that you're running out of time today, but it's smarter to wait until after Mercury turns direct this weekend before you do anything rash. Usually, you are able to be patient if you have a plan in place, but your feelings are strong enough now to tempt you to behave impulsively. Your greatest strength is your ability to calculate cause and effect. You'll know when it's time; until then, keep reminding yourself that you could lose a fantastic opportunity if you act too soon."
aquarius,2011-04-21,"You may be ready to start your journey, however, you probably don't have a clear idea of which direction to take today. You might have thought that you knew where you were going, but you aren't so certain anymore. You would be wise to consider making a correction to your itinerary before it's too late. Even if you're drawn toward multiple destinations, choosing one path now will pay off faster than you realize."
pisces,2011-04-21,"You could become interested in new ways to make money as enriching Venus moves through your 2nd House of Income over the next few weeks. But it's more important to reconsider any changes to your current course before putting them into action because they will likely sound better than they actually are in reality. Remember that you might want more than you need now, so it's wise to scale back voluntarily before circumstances require you to abandon your unrealistic plans."
aries,2011-04-22,"You are totally ready for whatever experiences the day may bring. However, you might also wish that you had more stability in your life now. These divergent feelings can grow into a real dilemma, especially if you aren't willing to admit that a part of you is very comfortable to continue with your same old patterns. Once you acknowledge your basic need for security, you can move on to whatever comes next."
taurus,2011-04-22,"You aren't easily satisfied as your key planet Venus joins eccentric Uranus, tempting you to reach for something or someone that you cannot have now. However, you don't need to waste your time trying to fulfill your transitory desires today. Instead, try applying yourself toward meeting your current obligations. Although being responsible doesn't sound as much fun as chasing a dream, the rewards should justify your total concentration."
gemini,2011-04-22,"You want to hang out with your friends this evening, but it will be tricky to actually follow through with your wishes. Someone who's close to you may need your assistance and you can't ignore a request for your help. It's important to process any unexpressed anger or resentment you have over a change of plans so that it doesn't get in the way of a meaningful experience. Being flexible enables you to make the most of a difficult situation."
cancer,2011-04-22,"It's important to put on a happy face, even if you're struggling with serious issues today. However, this tactic isn't a license to avoid the pressing issues of the day. Your smartest strategy is to stay aware of the current duality; remember that your inside and outside are following different scripts now and there isn't any need to fit everything into a tidy package. The stress will settle down and then the dilemma will probably just fade away."
leo,2011-04-22,"Your mind is on your well-being today with the Moon activating your 6th House of Routine, and you may be reconsidering ways to improve your diet and upgrade your exercise program. The problem is that you are also looking forward to a bit of indulgent behavior -- and this may be incongruent with your plans for healthier living. Remember, your approach doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing strategy. Don't be overly self-critical just because you're human. Cut yourself some slack and enjoy earthly pleasures while you can."
virgo,2011-04-22,"Although the responsible Capricorn Moon assures that you are being practical, you're still looking for some fun today. Fortunately, work and play aren't incompatible, but you could run into a problem when trying to balance the two. Life becomes more complicated if someone throws you a curve ball by inviting you to do something special. Your tendency is to say no, but it's a smart idea to take a chance and say yes."
libra,2011-04-22,"You may shock someone today by spilling the beans about what you want before you even think to censor yourself. Once you speak your piece, however, there's no way to take back your words -- even if you wish you could. Inadvertently hurting someone's feelings isn't your idea of successful communication, so think about your impact before you open your mouth and say what's on your mind."
scorpio,2011-04-22,"You might believe that you're being lighthearted and playful, but your words can carry sharp hooks today, even if your intentions are all good. You are a champion of sarcasm now; your dry humor and your incisive wit may be more biting than you realize. Don't tone down your ideas; just make sure that you express the truth with kindness."
sagittarius,2011-04-22,"Your current dilemma could pit your desire for fun against your more responsible need to save money. Your financial condition may be unstable now, yet you don't want your lack of expendable cash to deter your big weekend plans. Fortunately, you may discover that it's easier than you thought to cut back on unnecessary spending without negatively affecting your quality of life."
capricorn,2011-04-22,"These last several days have been rather strange, as if steady winds are blowing in from other dimensions. Now, however, the otherworldliness dissipates and your life begins to return to normal. Don't waste time attempting to figure out where you're going; just focus on what needs to be done for others. Your greatest pleasure comes from being productive in the present moment, not dreaming about the unknown future."
aquarius,2011-04-22,"The thrill ride continues and, although you have gained some common sense, your imagination has also been unlocked. Thankfully, you can distinguish between your dreams and reality today, but there's interference on all your communication lines, so it's impossible to speak with the same clarity you feel. Move through all discussions deliberately, while making certain everyone understands what you're saying before moving on to the next subject."
pisces,2011-04-22,"It seems as if someone's trying to make you feel guilty, especially if you are rebellious and do something now that's just for yourself. But it's not your job to keep everyone happy while you are left unfulfilled. This can be a great time to experiment and express yourself in radical ways because the security-conscious Capricorn Moon prevents you from taking your unorthodox behavior too far."
aries,2011-04-23,"If you didn't accomplish all that you intended over the past three weeks as Mercury retrograded in your sign, now it's time to set things right and get to work. You are done talking about what you need to do; today you must deliver the goods. Don't fall prey to someone else's harsh judgment or your own self-criticism. Words are important, but it's your actions that count the most."
taurus,2011-04-23,"Although your fantasies have been leading you into new territory lately, spinning your wheels of logic can help you untangle a sticky situation today. You are in a time of transition now that rational Mercury is turning direct in your 12th House of Imagination. Don't give up, because the answers to complex questions might not come all at once. Your good intentions combined with your infamous persistence should clear the way for effective action."
gemini,2011-04-23,"You may feel as if you've received the short end of the stick recently. It seems that others are getting off easy while you are paying the price for a hasty decision. But don't worry, because your key planet Mercury ends its retrograde phase today, enabling you to express yourself with newfound clarity. Think before speaking and then say exactly what's on your mind; your words can set you free."
cancer,2011-04-23,"You may not be as overwhelmed as everyone else seems today, even though your feelings are being bounced around by the changing tides, too. You have a sound sense of what's happening and you're not surprised by the current resistance you encounter. Observing your reactions to someone who tries to control you is more useful now than responding impulsively. Allow your emotions to settle down before sharing your point of view, or you might just complicate matters even more."
leo,2011-04-23,"You may have watched your plans fall apart as circumstances changed substantially over the past few weeks. Thankfully, mischievous Mercury is now done retrograding through your 9th House of Big Ideas and today's turnaround can send you off in a new direction. It may take a day or two for you to review what went wrong and to formulate a different approach, but don't get discouraged. You should be back on track soon enough."
virgo,2011-04-23,"Your key planet Mercury is up to mischief today as it completes its retrograde phase, and you are itching for forward movement. It may be difficult for you to get along with others now, especially if they have different goals than you. Unfortunately, your current impatience won't help the situation. Thankfully, you should do well over the next few days as your thinking grows sharper, enabling you to outmaneuver the competition."
libra,2011-04-23,"Your 7th House of Relationships is under quite a bit of stress today as talkative Mercury turns direct while opposing judgmental Saturn in your sign. It's not easy to lower your defenses now because others seem verbally aggressive. However, your heightened sensitivity might provoke you to misinterpret someone else's enthusiasm as criticism of your position. Don't take everything so seriously; being more flexible in your thinking will help you lighten up during these stressful times."
scorpio,2011-04-23,"You may be so focused on the details of a project today that you lose sight of the overall picture. Although your attention to little things that go unnoticed by someone else could actually save the day, you might drive others crazy with your unforgiving perfectionism. Keep in mind that progress will become more noticeable as clever Mercury gains momentum in the days ahead. Don't set aside what's important, but be smart enough to keep things in perspective."
sagittarius,2011-04-23,"You may get angry with your friends if they don't support what you're doing today, but their concerns are probably for your own good. It's not that your ideas are bad; it's just that your enthusiasm may be distorting your sense of proportion. Whatever commitments you make now might need to be scaled back in the days ahead. Remember that your good intentions won't necessarily overrule the laws of nature. There are only so many hours in a day and your positive attitude can only take you so far."
capricorn,2011-04-23,"You may believe that you need to justify yourself today, but living up to someone else's expectations now isn't as important as being true to yourself. Instead of rushing ahead and impulsively trying to make others feel more comfortable, let them take responsibility for themselves. You can still act with kindness and compassion, but do your own emotional housekeeping before cleaning up for anyone else."
aquarius,2011-04-23,"Trickster Mercury's direct turn in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment keeps you busy with one distraction after another. You could run around faster and faster today, yet end up feeling like you didn't get anything done at all. Nevertheless, you can reduce your frustration by simply thinking about the consequences before you start moving. A little self-restraint might be enough to put a more positive spin on the entire weekend."
pisces,2011-04-23,"Be careful what you say today because you could easily convince someone that you know what's best, even if you don't. You are tempted to make a snap decision about buying something you don't need, and Mercury's direct turn in your 2nd House of Money might have you thinking that you can spend more than you should. Ask someone you trust for advice, rather than simply defending your choice. Listen to the feedback you receive before you finalize a purchase."
aries,2011-04-24,"You are ready to go out and have fun today, but you might be a bit detached from what actually happens. Ironically, you know what you want, but may not care all that much if you actually get it. Remaining open to the difference between your wishes and the events of the day can be healthy, but don't be so disconnected that you are in denial of your emotions. Acknowledging your feelings is a crucial part of your long-term happiness."
taurus,2011-04-24,"You know what you want to say to those around you, but you might choose to minimize the intensity of your current feelings. Part of the problem is that you're connected with your dreams, and you don't want to justify yourself to anyone else now. Acting as if you're emotionally detached gives you a bit more freedom. Just keep in mind that it also takes work to avoid getting hooked on your desires."
gemini,2011-04-24,"You are looking forward to beginning something new in the days ahead, but you first have to finalize your plans. Acting impulsively won't be sufficient; this isn't just about doing something for fun. The Moon's entry into your 9th House of Adventure reflects your current need to expand your horizons. Don't settle for the easy way out; creating a sound strategy can be your key to accomplishing your goals."
cancer,2011-04-24,"You are emotionally nurtured by the physical closeness of your loved ones, yet now you might feel resistant to someone's advances. Your current retreat probably isn't about fearing intimacy; instead, it's more likely about your goal to become more independent. Stepping out beyond your comfort zone is healthy as long as you don't alienate your loyal allies in the process."
leo,2011-04-24,"A weird conversation with a close friend or partner today could reveal more information than you think you need to know. You might be uncomfortable because you aren't certain how to respond to what you learn. Keep in mind that you don't have to control what's happening, nor do you have to do anything about your new perspective. Take all the time you need before drawing your own conclusions."
virgo,2011-04-24,"You don't want to do your routine chores in the same way as you have always done them. You are bored today and might attempt a different approach just to make your day more exciting. Don't be concerned if something takes longer because of your unorthodox style. Time isn't really being wasted, because you're gaining valuable experience that can pay off in the near future."
libra,2011-04-24,"You may want to spend time with a really good friend today because their enthusiasm is contagious and fun. You feel as if something is about to change and your life could suddenly become more intense. However, there's no need to worry about being too busy later on; you'll still find time to relax. Make a commitment to enjoy yourself no matter how the day plays out."
scorpio,2011-04-24,You may come close to losing your temper today if something at home doesn't conform to your heart's desire. It's not that an unexpected exchange will catch you off guard; it's just that you could be compulsive about how you want your day to unfold. Your current inflexibility can make you feel discouraged. It helps to be open to the natural fluidity of the moment. A total surprise may turn out much better than you expect.
sagittarius,2011-04-24,"There are many things to do and so many interesting people to see, but you may have packed one too many activities into a finite amount of time. Instead of simply enjoying the diversity, you could be distracted by the practical necessity of having to adhere to a tight calendar. Try canceling or even postponing a few appointments before it's too late. Your weekend will be more enjoyable if you adopt a slower pace."
capricorn,2011-04-24,"You're eager to have a bit of time at home today, especially if a busy social calendar has kept you jumping throughout the past week. It's healthy to reconsider what you want for yourself now, instead of just keeping up appearances and doing whatever's expected of you. Maintaining your integrity is important. Set new boundaries and, within reason, do whatever makes you feel good."
aquarius,2011-04-24,"You may be needier than usual today with the Moon visiting your sign. Unfortunately, your friends and family might not take care of you and you cannot realistically expect them to read your mind. You'll be happier if you are open with your feelings and clearly communicate what you want, even if you have little chance for satisfaction. Be upfront and only participate in activities that will make you happy."
pisces,2011-04-24,"Although there are still opportunities available, you feel the weight of the world on your shoulders today. But your somber perspective is internal, so you might not want to burden others with your troubles. Fortunately, you are able to lighten your load by focusing on your ideal future and allowing the hope of your dreams to lift you beyond your current obligations."
aries,2011-04-25,"Although it's back to work for many today, it might still seem like a play day to you. Even if you have obligations to fulfill, you can probably figure out how to involve your friends. You may be like Tom Sawyer, making your chores look like so much fun that others will want to join in and help. Everyone may end up having a good time, regardless of what you are doing. Ultimately, it's the feeling of camaraderie that makes this day a memorable one."
taurus,2011-04-25,"You want to demonstrate your intelligence today so others will see you as a leader. Staying a step ahead of everyone else enables you to command enough authority to be in charge. However, you might not want all the responsibility that comes with this territory, just because you are seen as the top dog. It's challenging because you're not sure about the choices you have to make. Worrying won't make anything better, so just decide the best you can and move on."
gemini,2011-04-25,"Thinking about the future is easy today, but it becomes more complicated if you have to include others in your decisions. At first, you may enjoy the idea of strategizing how to get your friends involved, but executing your plan may be more challenging than it appears. You might grow irritated because your associates are not acting like team players. If the frustration gets to be too much, don't be afraid to just proceed on your own."
cancer,2011-04-25,"You have been managing a balancing act between your personal needs and your public responsibilities for a while, and now a conflict with a close friend or partner complicates things even more. You don't care about the superficial aspects of what's happening; you need to share on a deeper level. However, it's not easy to open up if you are afraid of being hurt. Revealing your emotions without being overly attached to the outcome can alleviate the pressure, enabling you to overcome your fear."
leo,2011-04-25,"You are quite hopeful about a new relationship today, but you still may experience wide mood swings with the Moon activating your 7th House of Partners. Try not to be so attached to your fear of abandonment; don't over-personalize a situation if someone inadvertently excludes you. You are best off trusting your friends and giving them the same freedom that you want given to you."
virgo,2011-04-25,"Although you may still be feeling anxious today, setting priorities and concentrating on the most practical chores should ease the tension. Unfortunately, focusing isn't a simple task because you can see too many possibilities ahead, which might make you more resistant to the upcoming changes. Bring your thoughts back to the here and now, for the present moment is the only place where you can create an impact. Don't worry about the inevitable; your future will arrive exactly on schedule."
libra,2011-04-25,"You can be the life of the party today or the one who's busy telling jokes at the office water cooler. But your spontaneity adds to your charm, belying your underlying seriousness. Ironically, several planets in your 7th House of Relationships could shift the focus off of you now and bring someone into your life that helps you see yourself more clearly. Your interactions with others give you a mirror with which you can see into your own soul."
scorpio,2011-04-25,"You might mistrust your feelings today as the emotionally detached Aquarius Moon visits your 4th House of Security. It makes you uncomfortable when your rational thoughts are telling your heart what to do, and you're particularly vulnerable if you lose touch with your feelings. Finding balance is tricky now because ignoring your passions will land you in trouble. Nevertheless, think first before doing something you may regret."
sagittarius,2011-04-25,"Your friends and associates might find it difficult to accept that you feel so good now. They may believe that something is lurking in the twilight behind your bright smile. Luckily, they are wrong. Although deep issues can rise to the surface over the next few days, you are quite capable of handling them. Don't worry about what others think; just be true to yourself."
capricorn,2011-04-25,"You have entered a period of financial uncertainty and nothing you do seems to make sense of your fiscal picture. Even a decision about a straightforward purchase could set you on a trajectory that culminates in the sobering realization that you do not have an endless money supply. Although you might understand the steps to manifesting abundance, it may take you longer than you wish to have enough cash to buy what you want."
aquarius,2011-04-25,"It's difficult to see the effect you have on others today; however, it's still useful to contemplate the results of your actions before you undertake something that wastes your time and energy. No matter how good your intentions are now, you can still come on too strong. It's not helpful to annoy someone who normally supports you. However, you could raise suspicions if you are overly cautious. Your smartest strategy is to acknowledge your own power, but wield it only if necessary."
pisces,2011-04-25,"You are easily enamored with your own fantasies today as the Moon moves through your 12th House of Imagination. You might even forget when to return to reality. Although drifting off into your dreams is often a rejuvenating activity, you won't be able to turn your back on your responsibilities now. Planning a temporary escape can work as long as you cover your bases in the real world."
aries,2011-04-26,"It feels as if you're on the edge of an emotional cliff and you may be considering whether or not to jump. You intuitively know that you will be safe as you float toward the ground, and the anticipation is exciting. Yet the mysterious tug into the abyss can also be scary. You might not be as comfortable in the feeling realm, especially if you're not in control. Nevertheless, your experience can be meaningful and memorable if you're willing to take a risk."
taurus,2011-04-26,"The analytical Aquarius Moon stimulates intense Pluto and your key planet Venus today, plunging you into an emotional drama. Thankfully, this can open up your heart in a very profound way. However, problems in love arise if you believe you'll be able to always stick to your agenda. It helps to acknowledge that you don't have all the answers because being flexible isn't easy for you. Forget about being right; it's better now to ride the waves of your feelings, instead."
gemini,2011-04-26,"You are tempted to dance your way around a very delicate topic of discussion today. However, you can inadvertently bring up unnecessary pain for someone you love if you cannot face the underlying emotional conflict in a mature manner. Forget about the clever comebacks and witty responses. Making light of your feelings detracts from your real work now. Overcome your fear and accept the responsibility to explore real solutions rather than superficial ones."
cancer,2011-04-26,"You don't want to create an emotional conflict today, but you realize that stepping into unfamiliar territory now can lead to a worthwhile reward. You might need a bit of help from a friend or lover to assist you through your resistance, but your fears should dissipate once the conversation gets underway. Remember, there isn't a right way to respond as long as you're true to your heart."
leo,2011-04-26,Allow your hopes and dreams to inspire you to swim against the tide today because this can bring you closer to your passions. This isn't an easy day; you may have to stir up some difficult issues so you truly feel alive. Just remember that you can express yourself without making anyone else wrong. You can effectively bring a conversation back to your perspective while acknowledging that others don't need to agree with your point of view.
virgo,2011-04-26,"It's helpful to remain as neutral as possible today if someone else tries to engage you in a struggle for control. However, this will be increasingly difficult to do throughout the day, especially if you feel threatened. Even if you do not want to escalate a conflict, your detachment can only last so long. You shouldn't have to suppress your feelings if you are clear about your message. Taking a few deep breaths will help prevent you from saying something that you regret later on."
libra,2011-04-26,"Your friend or workmate may put you in an uncomfortable position today, asking you to reveal something you intended to keep private. The stakes can be too high to play games now; your best strategy is to express your feelings rather than pretending that everything is okay. Ultimately, a difficult conversation can clear the air of unspoken tensions and pave a path toward a more meaningful relationship."
scorpio,2011-04-26,"Your ruling planet Pluto is tensely aspected by the Moon today and sensual Venus later tonight, driving you to test the boundaries of love and to seek the intensity that may be absent from your life. But your fierce passion could have the exact opposite effect on someone else. If others believe that you are being too forceful, they might withdraw, enticing you to apply additional pressure. Although you don't have to hide your feelings, it would be smart to soften your approach."
sagittarius,2011-04-26,You are attracted to the unknowable mysteries that are stirred by love today. But your fears tempt you to retreat when you get close to emotions you cannot control. This is a bit of a paradox because you won't be able to experience the magic if you're not willing to delve into the shadows. Don't pretend that you are in charge when you're not. Expressing your vulnerability can open a doorway to intimacy now that was previously hidden from view.
capricorn,2011-04-26,"Passionate Pluto's long-term visit to your sign is stimulated today by the Moon and Venus, the planet of love. It's not a simple task to explore your sensual desires because they may take you further than you want to go. However, the rules won't make you feel safe now, for it's apparent that there are no absolute limits. Thankfully, your uncharacteristic willingness to delve into the uncertainty of your feelings can bring you closer to happiness."
aquarius,2011-04-26,"Memories that you believed were safely hidden away may now explode into your consciousness, shattering your illusion of emotional detachment. Needless to say, this is disconcerting, for you are more comfortable when your rational thoughts are in charge. It's no use trying to put everything back as it was. Instead, be responsive to whatever happens today by openly expressing what's in your heart. You can always reclaim your cool intellectual demeanor tomorrow."
pisces,2011-04-26,"You want an emotional connection now that has real meaning, but the intensity of the moment may be even more than you can imagine. Although you're eager to explore unfamiliar territory in search of love, you prefer that things were simpler. Nevertheless, taking a risk with someone you trust and sharing your feelings requires courage. However, the cost is worth it, for you just might discover a precious gem that can help heal your heart."
aries,2011-04-27,"Clearly communicating your point of view sounds like a good idea until someone steps forward with a conflicting opinion. You might try to convince him or her that your perspective is the correct one, but you may not be the only person who is committed enough to fight for your beliefs. Rather than wasting energy defending your conclusion today, use this interaction as an opportunity for growth. However, you must remain open now to ideas different from your own."
taurus,2011-04-27,"You are able to stand firm in your beliefs today, making others recognize that you have the determination to reach your goals. Your associates will most likely support your ideas because they are eager to be on the winning team. However, it's not a good idea to abuse your power. If your actions come from selfish desires, you won't be able to keep your following. Fortunately, you can go far if you are conscious enough to work toward the common good."
gemini,2011-04-27,"You have open channels of communication today that tap into rich archetypal symbols. You can gain guidance from subconscious images that pop into your awareness, but this isn't just a mental exercise. Your dreams motivate you to act directly on your feelings instead of on rational thoughts. Don't try to filter or intellectualize your fantasies; allow them to bypass your head and directly touch your heart."
cancer,2011-04-27,"You are able to clearly see where you're heading now and could become the person that everyone depends on because of your solid sense of direction. It's wise to rely on your instincts because you know where you are, and how to get where you are going. But you must pay careful attention today since everything seems to be moving so fast. Update others with the details often so everyone feels included in the process."
leo,2011-04-27,"You can waste a lot of words today by talking about what's happening and what you think needs to be done. Unfortunately, others may not be listening very well. It isn't that you're boring; in fact, your friends usually want to hear what you have to say. It's just that they're tired of idle chatter now. It is time for taking constructive action; you will be noticed if you do more and say less."
virgo,2011-04-27,"You can see things more clearly today as if your world suddenly became brighter. Although your senses are usually sharp, you have a much wider range of perceptions today. Experiences that may have been beyond your awareness only yesterday are now beckoning you into new territory. Enjoy this journey of growth; metamorphosis is safer than you think."
libra,2011-04-27,"You might feel as if other people are still being pushier than necessary, but it may not disturb you today because you have found the courage to stand up for yourself. Your unshakable conviction is your secret weapon now; if you're in tune with your own purpose, then no one can come between you and your soul's destiny."
scorpio,2011-04-27,"The Sun's harmonious trine with your key planet Pluto allows you to move forward with unrelenting intent. The absolute certainty that arises from accepting your fate won't lead you astray today. However, acquiescing to your destiny isn't about being powerless; it's about taking responsibility to create the waves upon which you are riding. You are a mover and shaker now, so go out of your way to make something memorable happen while you can."
sagittarius,2011-04-27,"You are able to strengthen your financial foundation these days as the Sun harmonizes with potent Pluto in your 2nd House of Money. Thankfully, you can overcome nearly any limitations that you currently face. One obvious way to progress toward your fiscal goals is to spend less money, yet this strategy might not take you far enough. Consider refinancing your home, making a wise investment or even accepting a second job. Whatever you try now, think seriously about your future security."
capricorn,2011-04-27,"You are more intense today as Pluto in your sign is emphasized by its aspects to Venus and the Sun. Others might not realize how grounded you are because your passions are close to the surface. Fortunately, you can express your feelings and are then able to back them up with practical action. Don't be satisfied with what you already have; set new goals and then work to achieve them. You might surprise yourself with how much you can accomplish now."
aquarius,2011-04-27,"You have an opportunity to share your opinion about a delicate matter today without stirring up trouble, even if your perspective is controversial. If you previously upset others because of your unconventional beliefs, you now get to express the same thoughts without creating more negative repercussions. Make certain that you present your conclusions logically without attacking anyone else's values."
pisces,2011-04-27,"Your friends may come to your assistance today and support you in ways that money can't buy. On a mundane level, they might help out with physical labor or by protecting you from others. Your closest allies will also speak the truth, even if it isn't what you want to hear. You can always go out and hire someone to work for you; however, it's a real gift when you receive honest and intelligent feedback from someone that you can trust."
aries,2011-04-28,"Your confusion level rises today, especially if you believed that you were progressing, only to find that you have run into an obstacle. Thankfully, this isn't necessarily a long-lasting concern. The solution to your current delay may be as easy as making a renewed commitment to your goals. If you voice your intent clearly, you could regain your original cruising speed very soon."
taurus,2011-04-28,"Your daydreams seem to be quite vivid today, leaving you slightly unsure of what you should trust. You prefer building your future on a solid foundation, rather than on unrealistic fantasies. In fact, you could become quite uncomfortable when your real world is influenced by your imagination. Fortunately, you can regain consciousness by waking yourself up from your reverie. Paradoxically, you will be more able to rest once you do."
gemini,2011-04-28,"The answer to your current question may appear to you as a vision today. Or, perhaps what you should do next is revealed in a dream. Unfortunately, you can get into trouble if you just accept whatever pops into your mind as the truth. A hunch can lead you off track because your thinking is colored by your desires. An active imagination is wonderful, but not if you really need hard facts to inform your decision."
cancer,2011-04-28,"You might not want to stick to your schedule today because you would rather spend more time in unhurried contemplation than conforming to the clock. However, dreaming about the future isn't the most efficient way to reach it. Nevertheless, you don't have to deny your desire for drifting off into fantasies. Save your meditation for later in the day so you can still connect with the richness of your imagination after you fulfill your more mundane obligations."
leo,2011-04-28,"You have a lot to learn today from digging deep into the hidden shadows of your subconscious, but it may not be obvious how to do it. It would be easier if you could just beam yourself from one dimension to another and back again. Normally, you would benefit by relaxing in the dreamy realms of your imaginary world, but you can't now if others are expecting you to show up and be productive. Doing your job first removes the pressure and allows you to take your much-needed spiritual journey with a clear conscience."
virgo,2011-04-28,Your friends and associates are the source of confusion today because they don't seem to fit into your plans. You may be overwhelmed by how much you have on your plate and you need to focus on being as efficient as possible. But others seem to float in and out of your life without any concern for what you are trying to do. Don't rely on anyone else now; just establish your objectives and follow your path on your own.
libra,2011-04-28,"It's difficult to concentrate on your work today and, ironically, the more you try, the more distracted you become. But there's no need for concern about anyone else luring you off track, for it's your own mental wheels that are spinning now. Keep in mind that you cannot solve this dilemma with force, so give yourself permission to meander into a daydream for a while. You'll probably be twice as productive once you return to reality."
scorpio,2011-04-28,"You don't want to answer to anyone else today because you really would like to take some time off to play. The problem is that your current wish may go unfulfilled because others are depending on you. Ultimately, you have to show up and demonstrate your reliability. Fortunately, with a little extra concentration, you might be able to keep up appearances and still escape into your imagination at the same time."
sagittarius,2011-04-28,"You know you must keep your feet squarely on the ground these days and do your job without fail. Unfortunately, you could have a tough time following through on your responsibilities today. You know what needs to be done, but you're also aware that things are only going to get more complicated once you begin your project. Remember, your progress will flow easier if you remain flexible. Ultimately, you'll reach your goal, although it may take a bit longer than you originally planned."
capricorn,2011-04-28,"Your creativity has a life of its own today and you may be unable to manage your workflow with any sense of consistency. As soon as you get started you might realize that you're being drawn into unknown territory. However, if you believe that you know where you're going, you could miss the wave completely. Don't try to control the process; letting go is the most crucial thing that you can do now."
aquarius,2011-04-28,"Everything seemed so straightforward before you actually began to execute your rather simplistic plan. You realize that you have to stabilize your recent explosive growth or you could risk losing what you've already gained. Sticking to your agenda makes sense, but only up to a certain point. Following a hunch and reconsidering your direction may be the smartest thing you can do now. Just remember that taking lots of small steps is more reliable than just a few giant ones."
pisces,2011-04-28,"You cannot hide your true intentions now that the Moon is in your sign, for others can see through your attempts at secrecy. Although being vulnerable makes you feel unsafe, your fears could be worse than any real danger. Don't waste your energy protecting yourself from others; instead work to build your self-esteem so it doesn't matter if anyone sees through your veneer. Honoring your integrity is the best way to assure your emotional security."
aries,2011-04-29,"Today is one of those days when you might not even realize that you've slipped into the Twilight Zone. If you pay close attention to everything happening now, you might notice that things are bent slightly out of shape. Slipping into this parallel world isn't the problem, but mixing it up with the real one can prove troublesome. Rely on your friends to help you distinguish your illusions from reality."
taurus,2011-04-29,"You are quick-witted enough to outsmart yourself today. There is so much activity going on within your unconscious mind that you might forget what just occurred only a few minutes ago. Naturally, this can create a very embarrassing situation unless you consciously decide to stay on top of it all. Don't be afraid to trust your snap judgment. Thankfully, your intuition won't lead you astray now."
gemini,2011-04-29,"You may share a feeling today that provokes a strong and clear response. But rather than receiving a round of all-too-familiar criticism, you might actually get an unexpected boost of support from someone who isn't usually your closest ally. Be careful, for you might be reading the situation incorrectly. And even if you're positive about the accuracy of your perceptions, keep in mind that everyone's feelings are prone to change now."
cancer,2011-04-29,"You may be daydreaming of taking a quick trip to a faraway destination, however, there's this little problem of transportation. You might prefer the idea of near instantaneous travel because you want to get to your exotic destination immediately and still be home in time for a comfortable dinner. Unfortunately, you are just setting yourself up for disappointment unless you can be satisfied by traveling in the fantasy realms instead of actually going anywhere for real."
leo,2011-04-29,"You have a practical agenda today, yet you might choose to set it aside if there is an opportunity to do something more exciting than taking care of business. Don't be too concerned about other people's expectations; you need to follow your own heart. Rather than wasting energy trying to justify your actions, attend to your responsibilities first, so whatever you do next is beyond criticism."
virgo,2011-04-29,"You may be rethinking upcoming travel plans that you thought were already set. Or, perhaps, you're juggling your responsibilities so you can fit everything into your schedule. But it's tricky now because you cannot do this work alone. You'll improve your chances for success if your co-worker or partner supports you, so include him or her in your scheming. Remember that nothing is etched in stone yet. Today's decisions could change as soon as tomorrow."
libra,2011-04-29,"You have many small tasks to finish and it's wise to complete as much as possible prior to the Moon leaving your 6th House of Routine. It becomes more complicated to return to chores left undone once your attention moves on to something else. Also, it's quite likely that someone will distract you later in the day and your schedule will be unexpectedly hijacked; don't put off anything important unless it's beyond your control."
scorpio,2011-04-29,"You may welcome an exciting diversion to your daily routine today, but your responsibilities could suffer in the process. Surprisingly, you'll probably say yes to an invitation that comes your way, even if you don't think that you can take the time to play. Naturally, meeting your obligations remains a high priority, but your overall quality of work won't be as good if you don't also give yourself the chance to relax."
sagittarius,2011-04-29,"You might experience unexpected tension because of the responsibilities that now fall on your shoulders. However, you are still ready to go out and have some fun, no matter what the consequences are. Your productivity will likely slack off today, but you should be able to make up for it tomorrow. At least, show some creativity by mixing up boring chores with new activities that are more exciting."
capricorn,2011-04-29,"You probably won't be able to stick to your plans today, and accepting this fact upfront could alleviate a lot of unnecessary stress. Your moods are swinging all over the map, making you less likely to follow through on your original agenda. Rather than suppressing your feelings, remain open to them. Maintaining objectivity now could be exhausting and unproductive. You will feel much better once you give yourself permission to temporarily relinquish control."
aquarius,2011-04-29,"You may receive an unexpected message today from someone who is very close to you. Paradoxically, what you are told could be contrary to what you thought you were going to hear. This new information could complicate your day, but you'll only make matters worse if you try to block it out. You can't avoid the negative consequences by pretending there isn't a problem. Be smart and face any issue that surfaces now before it spins out of control."
pisces,2011-04-29,"You may feel unsettled today because you know something is about to change. Your feelings are quite volatile now and you don't know where they are leading you. Unfortunately, your attempts to suppress your needs could provoke you to unconsciously act out. Trying to control the situation by limiting your interactions with others will only make you feel lonely. Remember that you are a Fish and should know that it's easier to swim with the currents instead of resisting the tide."
aries,2011-04-30,"You may be getting tired of the same old story. You're hot to trot today, but you must wait for one reason or another. But instead of getting yourself all worked up because you cannot have what you want now, try taking a more mature approach and acknowledge that you may have something important to learn. Others love your fiery approach to life, but they will respect you more if you can also be patient when it's appropriate."
taurus,2011-04-30,"You might not allow yourself to have a good time now, especially if you believe that others will judge you harshly if you don't deliver on your promises. Unfortunately, stern Saturn's tense opposition to your key planet Venus turns you into your own taskmaster. There's nothing wrong with catching up on chores; just don't harbor resentment toward those who choose play over work today. Don't worry; your chance for fun will be waiting for you later on."
gemini,2011-04-30,"You are ready to lose yourself in a crowd today, whether at a party, a sporting event or the mall. It's your way of temporarily forgetting about all your responsibilities, but this strategy won't work no matter how invisible you feel or how fast you run. Fortunately, you can still enjoy yourself in a social setting as long as you don't have escape on your mind. Make the most of your time with others and then return to the chores you set aside earlier."
cancer,2011-04-30,"You are uncharacteristically motivated to take bold action because you want to demonstrate a more dynamic side of your personality today. But you could try too hard and end up feeling rather foolish if you think you have to do something out of the ordinary just to be accepted by your friends and family. Instead of playing all your cards out in the open, do what comes naturally. It might be wiser now to assume the role of the strong and silent supporter rather than taking center stage."
leo,2011-04-30,"You want to have a little excitement in your life today and you're ready to lead the charge on an adventure with your friends. Unfortunately, they may not be as enthusiastic as you are now. Instead of trying to get others to support your idea of fun, leave them to their more sedate ways and go off by yourself. When you're done with your excursion, you can return refreshed and rejoin those you left behind."
virgo,2011-04-30,You're not interested in your typical analytical approach to relationships now; you are intrigued by juicier rewards that lure you out of your comfort zone. You feel more emotionally assertive than usual and might even frighten someone close to you because of your heightened sense of urgency. Paying attention to how others react and having the courtesy to give them the space they need today can bring the results you seek.
libra,2011-04-30,"As a Libra, you're often more interested in maintaining harmony in a relationship than in always getting your way. The moody Moon joins your key planet Venus in your 7th House of Partnerships today, reemphasizing what others want. Although you are normally comfortable with taking care of someone else's needs, you've had enough of being taking for granted. Stand up for yourself now by putting your foot down to set limits. However, don't be surprised if it takes longer than you prefer to be taken seriously."
scorpio,2011-04-30,"You are able to tell someone what you want today in no uncertain terms. You're also able to do it in a manner of clarity that doesn't blame anyone else for your dissatisfaction. In fact you seem somewhat detached from your needs even as you express them. However, you could be holding onto unexpressed anger, possibly on an unconscious level. Don't bury your feelings; if something is bothering you, get it off your chest or it could return later in the form of a projection."
sagittarius,2011-04-30,"You may not be willing to modify your plans today in order to be included by your family or friends. You would rather separate yourself from others and keep your sense of integrity, even if it means doing something on your own. Thankfully, you won't likely feel left out because you could be too busy riding your own wave of creative expression. Nevertheless, you'll probably feel happy to be back in the fold tomorrow."
capricorn,2011-04-30,"You are quite aware of how you must suppress certain desires today in order to accomplish very specific goals. You want to have as much fun as the next person, but you're also able to put personal pleasure into a wider perspective. Still, you can't help but contemplate the emotional cost of success now. Everything has its price; just don't sell yourself short."
aquarius,2011-04-30,"You may have set goals that you now realize you cannot quite reach. Or, perhaps, an obstacle prevents you from doing as much as you wanted to do on a project. But instead of feeling defeat or discouragement, you might have a sense of relief as you reconstruct your day now that you have more time to enjoy yourself. Fortunately, today's dark storm cloud has a silver lining."
pisces,2011-04-30,"You may be tempted to make an impulse purchase today, but this could be a setup for buyer's remorse. Perhaps the item in question costs more than you originally thought. Or, maybe, you worry that it's not a good investment because it's something you don't really need. Take your time and logically analyze the pros and cons of spending your money. If after rational consideration the expenditure still makes sense, then go ahead because it's probably a smart acquisition."
aries,2011-05-01,"Sometimes too much of a good thing is not a good thing. The exuberant Moon-Mars-Jupiter conjunction happening now in your fiery sign may be enough to blast you into orbit, but you'll need to pay extra careful attention to managing your energy reserves. It's challenging for you to think about tomorrow when there are six planets in Aries today. Anything you can do to soothe your soul or settle your wild ideas will help to make this a more memorable time."
taurus,2011-05-01,"You may be all worked up over a new idea today, but won't necessarily put too much effort into making your vision come true. It's not that you're particularly lazy now; it's just that your common sense could overrule your excitement. Remember, your plan deserves enough time to develop before prematurely rushing into action, especially if it's as brilliant as you think it is."
gemini,2011-05-01,"This continues to be a socially oriented weekend, but you may actually reach a point where you exhaust yourself just by having fun. Knowing when you've had enough is a sign of maturity, but setting limits can sometimes be a challenge. Overcome your fear of missing out on something special; call it quits and take some time to relax so you'll feel rejuvenated and refreshed going into the week ahead."
cancer,2011-05-01,"Although this may be a day away from work, your mind is likely focused on your status in the professional world. This might even involve making plans to accomplish your ambitious career goals. Your optimistic outlook creates an immediate impact on activities with friends or family members today. If you have earned the respect of those you love, enjoy basking in their appreciation. But don't waste time hesitating now; it's your turn to take charge."
leo,2011-05-01,"You can burn off excess energy today by doing something physical such as going on a long hike or working in the yard. But it's also important to engage your mind by learning something new. You may be satisfied by having a discussion with a friend about an entirely unique course of study, perhaps involving religion, metaphysics or politics. Whatever you choose to do now, reach out beyond your comfort zone because going the distance will be far more rewarding than staying on familiar ground."
virgo,2011-05-01,"Your interest in getting to the bottom of a mystery could be a bit over the top today. You want answers and you are prepared to ask whatever questions are necessary to find the missing information. However, your obsessive curiosity might seem confrontational, even if that's not your intention. You'll make  more progress if you don't push so hard. Be as transparent as possible so your actions are not misunderstood."
libra,2011-05-01,"A close friend or family member may be so optimistic today that you think he or she has gone overboard. At first it's fun being around people who are upbeat and interested in doing something out of the ordinary. But, eventually you realize that you might be the one who needs to issue a reality check. However, don't try to change others by raining on their parade. All you have to do is be clear about the limits of your participation."
scorpio,2011-05-01,"This is a perfect day to begin a spring cleaning project with energetic Mars joining visionary Jupiter in your 6th House of Details. You have a clear sense of what you want to accomplish now and you have the stamina to get things done. However, you must take a big job and break it down into smaller manageable tasks in order to be efficient. Just make sure that you don't bite off more than you can chew or you'll be tired at the end of the day with little to show for your hard work."
sagittarius,2011-05-01,"Blowing up balloons can be fun if you know when to stop; otherwise they pop, leaving you with nothing. Likewise, when red-hot Mars fires up buoyant Jupiter today, you could get into trouble by taking a good idea and turning it into such a big deal that it eventually fizzles. Fun-filled activities can put a wonderful smile on your face now as long as you remember to moderate your natural inclination for bigger, better and more."
capricorn,2011-05-01,"As much as you may enjoy a day off to spend at home with your family, too much domestic activity might have you thinking about ways to escape. It's not that you want to be somewhere else; it's just that you won't likely want to give up an entire day without having something tangible to show for it. Try involving others in some sort of home improvement project. If they seem more interested in having fun, join in the festivities for a while and then excuse yourself so you can accomplish something on your own."
aquarius,2011-05-01,"You are buzzing around today like a busy bee, flying from one flower to the next in a field filled with exciting distractions. There are so many possibilities you might feel a bit lost because you don't know where to start or what to do next. However, you would be better off to save your rational thinking for another day; now it's better to just jump in and have fun. Act first and analyze later."
pisces,2011-05-01,"Many people believe that material abundance begins with having healthy self-esteem. The uplifting Mars-Jupiter conjunction in your 2nd House of Self-Worth indicates that your self-confidence is on the rise now and could help you make an important decision. Fortunately, your current choices have a direct impact on your prosperity in the weeks ahead. Set your goals high and reach a little further than you normally would."
aries,2011-05-02,"You are conflicted when you feel the high-frequency excitement beginning to fade today. You're relieved because you're able to take a breath, but also sad to experience a pause in all the action. There's no need to be concerned since the upbeat energy will soon return. Meanwhile, take advantage of your break by doing something special to recharge your system. Thankfully, your sense of renewed vitality will be useful when the energy picks back up in a couple of days."
taurus,2011-05-02,"Although this could be a back-to-work day for you, it seems as if it will also bring you an opportunity to escape. It's your turn to chill out, so even if you must show up on the job, don't hesitate to create some personal time so you can contemplate your future. Others may think that you're being too aloof, but they don't necessarily understand how you Bulls process your emotions. Integrate your feelings through meditation and active daydreaming before doing anything about them."
gemini,2011-05-02,"You are quite insistent about what you want these days as your key planet Mercury moves away from its opposition to restrictive Saturn, enabling you to think more clearly. Oftentimes, you are quite happy changing your mind, depending upon the usefulness of your affiliations. But now you want to make your decisions in response to your dreams, whether or not they are grounded in reality. Don't get so caught up in being stubborn; let your natural flexibility lead the way, instead."
cancer,2011-05-02,"You may have the urge to socialize with some of your co-workers for no other reason than to talk about your plans and what you want to do in your future. Expressing your visions of an ideal life isn't a substitute for making something happen here and now. Nevertheless, you can still enjoy exchanging ideas in a non-judgmental way that can remind you of what's truly most important. Sharing is a two-way street; listening to others can inspire you to follow your dreams now."
leo,2011-05-02,"You may be stuck in an ongoing argument with yourself today as you try to balance your needs with your responsibilities. Unfortunately, your spontaneity may be constrained by previous commitments, giving you less freedom today than you wish. Nevertheless, you know what you must do, even if you are also considering a quick escape. Being practical is the smartest course of action now, since you'll have more opportunity for guilt-free play once your work is done."
virgo,2011-05-02,"You are tying up loose ends because you can work at a steady pace now. Ignore anyone who tells you to work faster; you'll instinctively do what's best for your productivity. Luckily, you can effectively defend yourself today. Don't be afraid to take a firm stand on an important issue, but try not to offend anyone else in the process."
libra,2011-05-02,"A lighthearted relationship can grow more intense when feelings sink beneath the surface. Thankfully, you are able to describe your emotions with clarity today, but your communication style could clash with someone else's approach. Go ahead and explain the best you can, but stop talking once you've made your point. Don't be overly impatient; reaching closure might take longer than you think."
scorpio,2011-05-02,"You just don't understand why your co-workers don't follow through on their promises. You would like to be more forgiving, but still someone can get on your nerves, provoking you to intervene. Unfortunately, throwing a temper tantrum won't accomplish anything worthwhile. You cannot make anyone else change. Instead, you would be wise to accept full responsibility for your own emotional response and then simply let it go."
sagittarius,2011-05-02,"Becoming mired in unnecessary details is very annoying, since you typically prefer holistically focusing on the bigger picture. Nevertheless, you see a real necessity to find your way back to the basics today as you create a direct path through all the excitement. Don't get lost in your work. Although you have a lot to manage now, it's better to seek a healthy balance between your single-minded ambition and your adventurous spirit."
capricorn,2011-05-02,"Sometimes being a hardworking Capricorn really does pays off. If you have been responsible all along, now you get to play. However, others may be jealous, especially if they still have unfinished chores that are infringing on their ability to have fun. Still, you're far from perfect, and today might reveal something you should have already finished. Don't take on too much stress; it's a lot better to enjoy yourself while you can."
aquarius,2011-05-02,"You have personal obligations that you aren't necessarily eager to address today. But you realize that procrastinating will probably delay everything else you need to do, too. Overcome your resistance and don't make your domestic duties less important than they really are. It may not be easy to initiate action now, but you'll feel more positive once you make some progress."
pisces,2011-05-02,"If you have plans for the week, you might not want to change them once you put them into place. Although your stubbornness could work in your favor by helping you to be more productive, adhering to your agenda could become increasingly stressful. A bit of flexibility might help to ease a difficult situation if someone else is stuck. Don't miss this opportunity to make a difference; with just a little effort, you could be a real hero."
aries,2011-05-03,"It may appear as if you are at the top of your game today. Actually, you don't even have to work very hard to amaze others with your finesse as you make your same old routine look like something totally new and different. But too much self-assuredness can lead you into trouble. Sloppy thinking or a hasty miscalculation could tempt you to take an unnecessary risk. Stick to the basics and save the fancy tricks for another day."
taurus,2011-05-03,"The pragmatic Taurus New Moon allows you to accomplish a lot, perhaps surpassing even your own expectations today. It's great that you're able to be so productive now, but it's even more important that no one will be able to talk you out of your current ambitions. Your legendary bull-headed stubbornness enables you to overcome nearly any resistance, so set your goals high and then focus on reaching them."
gemini,2011-05-03,"The steady Taurus New Moon activates your 12th House of Fantasy now, increasing the tension between what's real and what's ideal. Thankfully, the practical Taurus energy gives you enough stability to transform an apparently unattainable dream into something that can actually take form. Don't withdraw from the realm of unlimited possibilities because what manifests in the future begins in your imagination today."
cancer,2011-05-03,"Today's sensible Taurus New Moon highlights your 11th House of Groups, making this a fine time to strengthen your social network. Opportunities to build enduring relationships at work and play are likely to come your way; however, it may be up to you to make the first move. Sharing your long-term goals can be a catalyst that shifts the dynamics from a casual acquaintance into a deep friendship. It might feel risky to take the initiative, but an amicable overture to the right person can continue to benefit you well into the future."
leo,2011-05-03,"Today's reliable Taurus New Moon falls in your 10th House of Status, making it easier to express yourself on the job. Although you're able to explain a complicated recipe for success in very simple language, you may worry about your inability to execute your own strategy. Obviously, being an inspiring speaker now isn't enough. Overcome your fear of failure and lead by example, so that others can more easily follow you."
virgo,2011-05-03,"The pragmatic Taurus New Moon reaffirms what you already know about success. Nevertheless, you may be overwhelmed by a large project unless you break it down into several subprojects and complete them one at a time. Avoid the temptation to make a mad dash to the finish line today, because it's not as close as you might think. Fortunately, your drive for efficiency will help you shine, as long as you don't attempt to do everything at once."
libra,2011-05-03,"Libra is the sign of relationships, but today you crave more than just a pleasant interaction with someone. You need to sink beneath the attractive social veneers now or you could be left feeling unsatisfied. You know there is more to life and you want to experience it. But don't act too obsessively or you might appear desperate. Intimacy is best when it develops naturally on its own."
scorpio,2011-05-03,"The sensible Taurus New Moon activates your 7th House of Partners, influencing you to seek salvation from your complex life through an easygoing relationship. The persistence of Taurus offers the steadiness that you need, even if you are afraid of being limited by its simplicity. Ultimately, the choice is yours; the key to establishing an enduring relationship may hinge on your willingness to give up a little drama and overcome your fear of growing bored."
sagittarius,2011-05-03,"You have a lot of work to do now, and starting it right away means that you'll be finished even sooner. Creating consistency is critical since the earthy Taurus New Moon activates your 6th House of Habits. Starting a new job now is easier than ever with so many planets in spontaneous Aries. However, turning your initial excitement into an ongoing discipline is the next step to assuring your success."
capricorn,2011-05-03,"You may express yourself without a lot of forethought today, but you'll still need to make a plan if you want to succeed. The Taurus New Moon in your 5th House of Creativity motivates you to take a chance, but you must follow through on what you start or your efforts will have been for naught. Trying something totally new can be a lot of fun; however, it's crucial to come back to your senses and figure out how to accomplish what you set out to do in the first place."
aquarius,2011-05-03,"Five planets moving about in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment suggests that those close to you may be quite supportive of your efforts now. Paradoxically, your lack of flexibility could make it difficult to integrate their good ideas into your overall plan. Don't assume that your way is the only way; being open to the feedback you receive can make your work much less of a struggle."
pisces,2011-05-03,"The practical Taurus New Moon highlights your 3rd House of Communication, helping to ground the energy around you. Although the hectic pace may have settled down a bit, the noise isn't completely gone. Nevertheless, it's time to reflect on all that's happened over the past month before taking a few deep breaths and moving on."
aries,2011-05-04,"You are geared up to make it through the uncertainty of the day, but circumstances could change dramatically enough that you must modify your agenda. It's not wise to take success for granted now since you must work extra hard to see progress. Taking shortcuts won't work, either. Putting on an air of bravado won't do the trick today, so get serious and keep bringing your scattered energy back to the tasks at hand."
taurus,2011-05-04,"The Moon forms an uncomfortable semisquare with your key planet Venus today, tying your feelings up in knots. A simple desire becomes more complex as you obsess about the power that love has over you. However, your worries may just be the result of an overactive imagination. Don't waste time thinking about something that may never happen. You'll be happier if you keep your attention on the present moment."
gemini,2011-05-04,"Your key planet Mercury is finally regaining speed as it continues to recover from its retrograde phase last month. Don't be discouraged about your overall lack of progress on a creative project, for things should be turning around pretty quickly today. Nevertheless, it may be difficult to make up your mind with certainty now that the emotional Moon is back in your whimsical sign for a couple of days. Take your time before making any important decisions."
cancer,2011-05-04,"You need to begin a process of letting go now as the Moon moves through your 12th House of Endings. Your work may not flow as easily as you wish and there's no easy way to force yourself through the current creative block. Don't get hung up about something on the job that isn't moving ahead; instead, watch the signs and see what clues you can derive. Once you figure out the message, you will be permitted to proceed to the next step."
leo,2011-05-04,"The social aspects of your day may grow very complicated, pressuring you to contract your energy. However, you have personal business that must be attended to today, even if it's not much fun. Once you push through your own resistance, everything seems to become easier, freeing up enough time for you to do something totally unexpected by your peers. Setting your mind on a particular accomplishment is a wise strategy, but things won't necessarily turn out as planned. Let the element of surprise work in your favor."
virgo,2011-05-04,"It's all about establishing healthy patterns now and sticking to them, whether you want to or not. Your place of employment may be a bit overrun with people experiencing powerful emotions, and you're not interested in becoming one of them. Be fierce as you monitor your own performance in light of your career objectives. Make a few positive modifications to your daily routine before you try to progress further."
libra,2011-05-04,"It may feel as if your relationships are extra tense these days, especially if you're not getting your needs met. Your romantic urges are strong with flirty Venus and four of her planetary peers hanging out in your 7th House of Partners. You would rather be working with someone you like than being on your own now, and Messenger Mercury in impulsive Aries adds a false sense of urgency to your desires. Remember to relax; you really have more time than you think."
scorpio,2011-05-04,"Your emotional detachment can be disarming now because this isn't your usual character. You are often the champion of intensity, but today your passionate living motif seems to be absent. You are able to smooth ruffled feathers, but your friends might be slightly uncomfortable because they cannot read your energy clearly through your layers of insulation. Keeping others on the outside may be the best way now to protect your vulnerable core. Secrets are sometimes useful, but don't withdraw any more than is necessary."
sagittarius,2011-05-04,"You must pay careful attention to someone else's words today, because there's a lot at stake. This is a time of big changes and you don't want to miss an important opportunity. Nevertheless, the most significant information comes from others with the Moon now visiting your 7th House of Partners. Be patient and the puzzle pieces will fall into place. Even if you're sharing your own point of view, listen with care when relevant feedback is offered in return."
capricorn,2011-05-04,"It's often hard for others to argue with your sense of authority, but this isn't true today. As you issue commands now you might be more obtuse than you realize. It's challenging if you are feeling socially awkward, leaving you to doubt your ability to handle the current circumstances. Rest assured that your integrity is ultimately one of your greatest strengths, so don't sacrifice it for the sake of convenience."
aquarius,2011-05-04,"You may have an opportunity to share your feelings in a variety of ways today, but things might get complicated once you begin. However, it's not a smart idea to stop midcourse, even if you cannot grasp the impact of your words. Fortunately, everything should make a lot more sense within a few days. Don't waste time over-analyzing all the possibilities; the details will unfold soon enough."
pisces,2011-05-04,"You have a lot going on beneath the surface today, but others might not notice. Even if they ask incisive questions, you'll probably be able to smoothly evade their analytical probes. However, you must pay close attention, for someone may have less than honorable intentions. Keeping a healthy distance is a good idea if you're not willing to have an uninvited guest digging through your personal life."
aries,2011-05-05,"It seems as if your hectic life keeps getting busier and busier. As much as you enjoy the hustle and bustle, you are looking forward to a quieter time. However, it won't likely happen today. Fortunately, the fast pace feels good; you don't have time now to worry about what's not going right. Nevertheless, pick one task out of everything that's on your plate and focus on it with all the determination that you have. The results may be more satisfying than you expect."
taurus,2011-05-05,"You may feel as if your finances are a bit uneven today, even if nothing much has changed recently. But you probably won't share your insecurities with others now, for you might believe that giving a voice to your fears will only make them worse. You don't have to dwell on the negatives; take positive action instead -- even if it's as minor as paying a few bills. Anything that gives you a sense of control will help to ease your stress."
gemini,2011-05-05,"Your friends may think that you're not very grounded now that the Moon is moving through restless Gemini, but you are more stable than you appear. Nevertheless, your moods can fluctuate at a rapid rate today, so try keeping your opinions to yourself for a while before sharing them. Instead of running all over the map, speak your piece later on once you're sure of what you want."
cancer,2011-05-05,"There's no need for you to push so hard at work now, especially if you have been focused on your career ambitions all week. It's not that you can just take the day off, but you can keep your best ideas to yourself for a few more days, giving them a chance to mature. If you share too much of your current thinking today, others may stop listening. Let your patience work in your favor and give your strategy time to develop."
leo,2011-05-05,"It's nearly impossible for you to concentrate on the present moment with the Moon in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals plus five planets traveling through your 9th House of Adventure. Although you are looking forward with great anticipation, you must demonstrate your reliability today by putting in extra effort, because important events are unfolding at work. If you handle the immediate situation with integrity, the future will take care of itself."
virgo,2011-05-05,"You might have mixed feelings about a new project at work as the Moon moves through your 10th House of Career. Others are pushing you to make a decision today, yet you're probably unwilling to make a commitment just yet -- you may learn new facts that could motivate you to change your mind, or something better could come along. However, you can reduce the uncertainty and increase the stability in your life by choosing now."
libra,2011-05-05,"You may be thinking about pursuing a new course of study that isn't related to your career. Even if you have many choices before you, it's logistically impossible to follow more than one path. Thankfully, the Moon's harmonious trine to Saturn in your sign today can give you the clarity you need in order to make the smartest decision. After considering all your options, trust your intuition, pick your direction and get going."
scorpio,2011-05-05,"You are tempted to talk about your feelings today, even if you've been holding them back for a reason. You don't intend to hurt anyone, but your direct approach might sound insensitive. It's not what you say that can stir up ill will; it's how you say it. Think twice before you blurt out the truth. You can still express yourself honestly while also treating others with kindness and respect."
sagittarius,2011-05-05,"You may be more curious than usual today as you seek other people's opinions to help you clarify your own. It takes extra effort on your part now to pin someone down who continues to evade responding to your questions. Unfortunately, the more you push for resolution, the less likely you will get it. Step back and allow others to have some elbow room. You'll become more confident of your perspective by looking within, rather than listening to anyone else."
capricorn,2011-05-05,"As a general rule, information isn't something you collect unless you have a way to make use of it as you work toward your goals. You may be learning a lot at work now with the clever Gemini Moon moving through your 6th House of Employment, but you are hard-pressed to apply your new knowledge. Nevertheless, the tools you're gathering can help you to express yourself in ways you haven't yet imagined."
aquarius,2011-05-05,"Although you may have plenty to do at work, you could get antsy enough that you want to begin your weekend a couple of days too soon. You are able to come up with sufficient reasons to justify your restlessness, but all the talk in the world won't make your busy schedule any less demanding. Fortunately, managing your calendar becomes easier once you decide to have fun with it, instead of worrying about fitting everything in."
pisces,2011-05-05,"Your personal business could keep you hopping today as the light-footed Gemini Moon visits your 4th House of Home and Family. Unfortunately, it may take you longer than you expect to complete each and every task that's now on your plate. Thankfully, your self-esteem is running high these days, so you shouldn't have too much trouble responding to the current demands. Set your priorities by making a list to help you be more efficient."
aries,2011-05-06,"Although you won't likely take no for an answer today, you may need to do some fast talking before you receive the approval you are seeking. You might become frustrated if you're caught up by circumstances you cannot control. On one hand, you shouldn't give up too soon, for persistence will probably bring you what you want. On the other hand, remaining flexible is essential because your needs are changing faster than you realize."
taurus,2011-05-06,"You need time to absorb the changes you have recently experienced, but one distraction after another now can keep you hopping. Thankfully, the energy should begin to settle down by tomorrow, giving you enough peace and quiet to actually hear your own thoughts. Meditation can eventually bring a feeling of contentment, but today you must learn to find satisfaction even while you're busy."
gemini,2011-05-06,"If you feel that your needs are going unmet today, it's probably because your moods are shifting very quickly while the Moon is in your fickle sign. You may get exactly what you want, but your desires continue to morph from one thing into another. Fortunately, your friends and associates are pretty easygoing about your current restlessness now, so it's unnecessary to hide your feelings. Keeping others informed about your process can help to build better friendships."
cancer,2011-05-06,"You might think that you need to keep something private, but once you begin telling your story today, your secrecy is overshadowed by your new policy of transparency. Perhaps you realize that you don't have to hide as much as you usually do, and your current excitement about belonging to an extended family or a social network can have you sharing your feelings before you have a chance to consider the consequences. It's time to come out of your shell, but don't overwhelm everyone in the process."
leo,2011-05-06,"You cannot hold yourself back once your attention shifts from listening to active participation. There may be valid reasons for your recent caution, but your progress on several fronts today should win out over your resistance. Don't try to talk yourself into keeping quiet because the talkative Gemini Moon in your social 11th house needs interaction with others more than you need your autonomy."
virgo,2011-05-06,"Making a case for what you want today doesn't assure that you will be satisfied right away. Nevertheless, this isn't a sensible time to back down, for your words carry more power these days than you realize. Remember that facing external resistance can be the result of projecting your own internal fears. Overcoming apparent obstacles may prove to be hard work now, but the potential payoff is worth the extra effort."
libra,2011-05-06,"You are a bit pushier than usual now, especially if given a chance to tell others about your exciting plans. Your easygoing approach may be thrown out the window as you face the fear of being rejected by a friend or partner. You might believe that turning up your volume is one way to compensate for your uncertainty. Just remember that this impulsive strategy could backfire, motivating others to withdraw. Fortunately, the long-term viability of your ideas is not affected by someone else's acceptance today. The only opinion that matters right now is yours."
scorpio,2011-05-06,"Today's interactive Gemini Moon provokes you to take a risk and lay your feelings out in the open, whether or not this is the most sensible thing to do. Unfortunately, others may become anxious if they aren't as comfortable as you are when it comes to handling intense emotions. Nevertheless, suppressing what you want to say will only make matters worse. Seeking the middle path works best; express what's in your heart without expecting anything in return."
sagittarius,2011-05-06,"The changeable Gemini Moon is illuminating your 7th House of Others, filling the day with one noisy interaction after another. The intriguing folks who enter your life now make it difficult to turn down an invitation to learn something new. Just remember that you don't have to impress anyone today; all you have to do is soak in as much information as possible and be grateful for the experience."
capricorn,2011-05-06,"You may not be able to shut off your thinking now while ingenious thoughts are spinning your head around. Fortunately, the steady Taurus Sun enables you to pick one good idea and turn it into something tangible. Don't be afraid to let your mind wander today, since you'll instinctively come back to center with something positive to show for your daydreaming."
aquarius,2011-05-06,"There's no need to show off your cleverness today, for those close to you already know that you're very smart. Instead of overstating your case or rambling on too long about your latest great idea, just show up and be yourself. Your intelligence shines through your actions as well as your words, so walk your talk instead of trying to convince others that your plan is the best one."
pisces,2011-05-06,"You may find yourself exploring new financial territory today, whether you're considering a major purchase, taking out a loan or making an investment. However, it's difficult to narrow your focus enough to make a choice as the scattered Gemini Moon aspects several planets in your 2nd House of Money. Remove the pressure by putting off your final decision until you've had a chance to gain more clarity on your next move."
aries,2011-05-07,"It may be easier to withhold your anger now than to express what you actually feel. Remaining tight-lipped could seem safer because of your fear that you'll share too much once you get on a roll. Unfortunately, relationships can cool if suppressed emotions turn into resentment. It might be wiser to sink into your feelings, put your thoughts in order and then speak your truth."
taurus,2011-05-07,"Your imagination can lure you far from reality now, making it difficult to return. Your emotions may seem overwhelming, turning you into your own worst enemy. Above all, don't try to go into denial, for you won't be able to use logic to outmaneuver your feelings. Remain open to whatever happens today because your current goals will likely morph into something else. Ultimately, your unflappable determination enables you to get back on track. Don't bother explaining anything until after you know you're moving in the right direction."
gemini,2011-05-07,"Your clever wit saves you from a difficult situation today. However, you still must carefully watch every step you take so you don't make a social faux pas. Your lighthearted sense of humor can relieve the pressure in the immediate moment, but it doesn't fix the underlying cause. Things are more complex than they appear now. Take your time and don't be so quick to tap dance around the edge of the unknown."
cancer,2011-05-07,"You might not like what you're feeling because the Moon in your moody sign is stressed by Uranus, Pluto and Saturn. The pressure builds, placing you in an awkward position. You would prefer everything to be out in the open, but the present circumstances could require you to remain silent for now. Although you may not find resolution today, the tension will be easier to manage once you realize that it's temporary."
leo,2011-05-07,"Being confronted with an intense emotional outburst today might be exactly what's necessary to awaken you from your complacency. Even if you believed that you had things under control, you're now beginning to see the unfolding drama in a different light. The first step is to acknowledge that your current plan won't be sufficient to get you through this power struggle. Thankfully, the intensity of your concentration should enable you to adapt to nearly anything that comes your way."
virgo,2011-05-07,"Handling the fallout from other people's reactions can be unsettling today, especially if someone is resisting you at every step you take. Although you don't want to retract your words, you might wish you hadn't revealed the depth of your current feelings. Working with your emotions isn't all fun and games now, but can prove to be very rewarding if you're willing to stick with the process."
libra,2011-05-07,"You may not be as certain today about a few of your recent choices. Asking tough questions is healthy, but harboring self-doubt is not. The next few days might be frustrating because you can't see very far into the future, making it nearly impossible to finalize your plans. Instead of allowing yourself to be overwhelmed by stress, engage the energy by doing chores around the house or working on an unfinished project. Rest assured that the dust will settle and you'll gain clarity regarding your final answer."
scorpio,2011-05-07,"You have had no choice other than to go along with external circumstances that seem to be outside of your control. Today, your mild concerns could explode into more serious fears. The Moon's opposition to your key planet Pluto may have you believing that the situation is worse than you imagined, whereas in truth, it's probably not nearly as bad as you think. Take whatever steps are necessary to put things back on track, but don't overreact. An emotional outburst will only stir up more trouble than it solves."
sagittarius,2011-05-07,"You are usually quick to share what you're thinking, but your impulsive tendencies may have you backtracking later on. Ironically, you're probably correct in your analysis of the current situation; it's just that everything is in flux today and you may jump to a conclusion prematurely. Fortunately, you will have an opportunity to reevaluate your choices and change your mind based upon what you learn later in the day."
capricorn,2011-05-07,"A close friend or partner may seem overly emotional today, prompting you to withdraw. You have your own stuff going on and you're not that eager to be sidetracked with someone else's issues. Nevertheless, it's important to stay present with your feelings to avoid forming unnecessary battle lines. A serious conflict won't produce any winners, so you would be wiser to resolve problems through open dialogue. Make sure that everyone involved is willing to compromise before you give up more than you should."
aquarius,2011-05-07,"You are torn between digging deeply into your feelings today and overpowering them with direct action. In fact, the illusion is that both approaches seem to exclude the other. The solution is not straightforward because a sensible strategy must incorporate both your internal process and your apparent behavior. Don't be afraid to admit that you are unsure of what to do next; engaging in an honest conversation with someone you trust is more useful now than getting fast results."
pisces,2011-05-07,"It's challenging to stand up for yourself now, especially if a powerful person in your immediate environment thinks that they know how you should live your life. You might be reluctant to admit that your point of view is different because you're not interested in defending your beliefs. Although this issue may resurface at a later date, it's best to wait it out and say as little as possible. What seems critical today won't be as important next week."
aries,2011-05-08,"You mean well, but sometimes others still perceive you as being insensitive. However, today you are so connected to the moods of those around you that you might attempt to fix a difficult situation in order to make everyone feel better. You could appear to be someone's champion at first, but assuming responsibility for another person's emotions can lead to dependency issues and power struggles. Be a good friend without taking over."
taurus,2011-05-08,"You can take a good feeling too far now that the Moon squares your key planet Venus and excessive Jupiter. Unfortunately, you probably won't get away with overdoing anything today because instant karma is lurking just around the corner, ready to make you pay the price for ill-considered behavior. It is wise to acknowledge your limits prior to going over them. Don't do anything you might later regret."
gemini,2011-05-08,"It's been challenging to relax lately, but you will find your groove today, even if it's a bumpy ride along the way. You are able to better comprehend what works for you, inspiring you to focus on your skills, rather than on your weaknesses. Pay attention so you know when to call it quits. Remember that taking the smartest idea to an extreme can turn the feeling of a job well done into one of dissatisfaction. Observing the emotional weather helps you to know when to stop pushing."
cancer,2011-05-08,"Your emotional needs can be quite overwhelming now that the Moon is visiting your sign. Fortunately, you shouldn't have too much of a problem requesting something that you want. However, you could create trouble if you demand too much. Even if you don't ask for anything, you may feel frustrated because you want more than you receive. But this isn't the best time to be overly needy. Instead of being melodramatic, be grateful for the blessings you already have in your life."
leo,2011-05-08,"Your recent creative cycle may be coming to an end, elevating the significance of current events. It's crucial to complete unfinished projects prior to beginning something new. Exercise caution because you might overlook what's really happening; being eager for success is not the same as idealizing a new opportunity. You will be best served now by seeing things as they truly are and not as you would like to see them."
virgo,2011-05-08,"Although you truly want to meet your obligations while still responding to changing dynamics at work, you could grow tired of office politics and decide not to engage in the games any longer. But your emotional withdrawal is a very powerful statement on its own, for nearly everyone understands that you normally analyze all the possible moves before deciding what to do next. Make sure not to burn any bridges today that you might want to cross in the weeks ahead."
libra,2011-05-08,"You have mixed feelings about a significant relationship now. You are ready to take charge and do whatever is necessary to reach your goals. On the other hand, you are weary of feeling like you're doing all the work. Either way will probably leave you wishing that you just listened to the other voice. The easy solution, however, is to keep busy in your pursuit of success without expecting too much from others."
scorpio,2011-05-08,"It seems as if everyone is telling you something different now and you want to benefit from each and every point of view. However, it's challenging to find the right balance between relying on your own experience and learning from others. Ironically, you can best see what's around the corner now by using your intuition, instead of seeking another perspective. Although it's usually an advantage to have multiple points of view, today your own opinion counts more than anyone else's."
sagittarius,2011-05-08,"You may be extremely enthusiastic about several different projects that are coming to a confluence at the very last minute. But the Moon squares your key planet excessive Jupiter now, luring you into a delicious trap that may appear better than it is. There's no cause for panic; it's wiser to act with a well thought-out plan tomorrow than with reckless abandon today."
capricorn,2011-05-08,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners can bring a highly emotional person to the forefront of your life today. And this may not be such an easygoing relationship now, for you might feel as if someone's toying with your heart. Attempting to reach a compromise or even bringing in a mediator can raise the stakes on a developing power struggle. It's your choice, so take the high road and disengage from all disagreements. Stepping back might be the simplest answer of all."
aquarius,2011-05-08,"You may feel as if you're in the midst of intense passions today, tempting you to seek solace in a more intellectual platform, for that is where you naturally excel. Unfortunately, the Sun's semisquare to your key planet Uranus emotionally charges your actions and quickly pushes you to the edge of discomfort. Indulging your senses appears enticing, but it's actually a distraction from the real work at hand."
pisces,2011-05-08,"Your creative process receives an energetic boost today when the Moon dynamically squares visionary Jupiter, your traditional ruling planet. Your active imagination is temporarily freed from fear and other emotional constraints, so your fantasies can take you nearly anywhere. Don't dwell on the negatives; dream about all the amazing possibilities, instead."
aries,2011-05-09,"Although Monday means back to work for many, playtime is still on your mind today and you might mislead yourself into thinking that you can escape your responsibilities. Unfortunately, it may be difficult to get any wind in your sails, so don't be intent on reaching your destination immediately. If you are too eager, your frustration could quickly become problematic. Consciously slow down, instead; enjoy your experiences as you flow in the prevailing currents."
taurus,2011-05-09,"Your obsession with one of your creative fantasies won't likely become a problem today if you can separate fact from fiction. Make use of your imagination to dream about the life that you want to live. Fill in the details of your vision, but don't share them with anyone else just yet. Allow the process to develop naturally on its own without focusing too much on the outcome."
gemini,2011-05-09,"You may feel as if the day is unfolding like an episode of 'The Twilight Zone.' It's challenging to tell where your strange dreams turn into reality. You would prefer being in control now, but the harder you try to keep things from falling apart, the worse it gets. Nevertheless, you may want to prove your competence by making a dramatic gesture. Fortunately, you might just pull off this grand illusion as long as you don't start believing your own hype."
cancer,2011-05-09,Your mood lightens today once the Moon leaves your sign to zoom into fun-loving and lively Leo. But you may still try to cling to unresolved emotions from the past. Attempts to communicate your feelings could keep you spinning in an endless loop. Don't rely on logic now; act in the moment without worrying too much about the consequences.
leo,2011-05-09,"The Moon returns to melodramatic Leo today, tempting you to demonstrate your feelings openly. Luckily, you don't expect anything in return for your performance because the feedback you receive now probably won't be too helpful, anyway. Unfortunately, no one seems to have a clear sense of your intentions. Stay true to yourself and honor your own feelings more than everyone else's."
virgo,2011-05-09,"You may attempt to let loose today, even if you can't afford to flirt with the edge. The problem is that you must stay singularly focused on your responsibilities over the next week. Unfortunately, your normal powers of analysis could leave you cold because you cannot make sense of what's happening now. Thankfully, things become less complex once you acknowledge that you don't even know the part you are playing, let alone the script."
libra,2011-05-09,"You are being challenged to find a workable balance between your desire to hang out with your friends and the need to handle other more pressing responsibilities. You would rather ignore the limitations that stern Saturn continues to place on you, but there's no easy way to avoid your current obligations. Nevertheless, you're not that willing to write off your social life. Thankfully, you can get a lot accomplished in a short amount of time now, allowing you to enjoy yourself later in the day."
scorpio,2011-05-09,"The dramatic Leo Moon draws you into the spotlight while enabling you to feel good about the recognition. You are usually adept at hiding your needs, but today you might just put them out there for all to see. However, even when you tell it like it is, there's still mystery around your motivation. Others want to know what's going on beneath the surface and they won't be fully satisfied until they do. Remember, it's not your responsibility to address their issues by saying any more than is necessary."
sagittarius,2011-05-09,"Today's showy Leo Moon connects with your own expressive nature, happily creating a successful formula for you. However, you can't get away with a lot now and you may have to work extra hard to meet your obligations. Others around you might have unrealistic expectations because they are seeking a leader and are unclear as to your current intentions. Take the time to be meticulous when explaining your plans to everyone else."
capricorn,2011-05-09,"Life seems overly complicated, especially if you're eager to swing into action and do something exciting today. Unfortunately, you probably won't be able to act on your own now. There may be a complex thread of interrelationships that prevents you from saying too much about anyone else. It's wise to temporarily acquiesce to someone else's authority, so keep your feelings to yourself for a while longer."
aquarius,2011-05-09,"Others may not understand or appreciate your strange behavior today and your dance could become one of avoiding the truth. But even your most direct approach could get lost in your foggy mental landscape. Your friends might believe that you are being contentious now, but you're not. Remember, you can still play well with others even if you're marching to a different drummer."
pisces,2011-05-09,"You want to demonstrate your compassion, but your actions might miss the mark today. Thankfully, it's not that your aim is wrong; it's more about your lack of certainty. You may even feel as if you've been blindfolded and led on a wild goose chase. There's no need for grandiose gestures; it's the small acts of kindness that everyone will remember the most."
aries,2011-05-10,"You are in a highly creative phase and it's up to you to find the best way to express yourself. This isn't just about having fun, for you cannot set aside your responsibilities. Your desires may be luring you toward pleasure, but you're more likely to make a mature choice now, instead of planning your escape. It's wise to fulfill your obligations, but don't ignore your most exciting dreams in the process."
taurus,2011-05-10,"The Moon's visit to your 4th House of Roots indicates that you have plenty of work to do on the domestic front. Although you may need to go to your regular place of employment today, you still might find a way to also spend plenty of time at home. Treat the smallest chores and simplest pleasures as significant acts so you can maintain a healthy and joyful perspective on your life."
gemini,2011-05-10,"It's a very busy day as your regular routine becomes more complicated today. You may talk about simplifying your life, but it's not going to be easy to cut back on your activities. Instead of fretting over what you cannot finish now, slow down enough to catch your breath and just try to meet your obligations as best you can."
cancer,2011-05-10,"Today's the day to shift into gear and put your plan into motion. You've had enough time to process your feelings and to consider what's ahead and you can't put off the inevitable. Instead of waiting for a better moment, take the first steps toward your goal now while you have the chance. It could take a while to get there, so don't delay starting any longer."
leo,2011-05-10,"You can actually feel the Moon now that it's back in your sign because your moods are vacillating more than usual. But you're also more confident today as the Moon moves toward a superconductive trine with optimistic Jupiter in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You may be too impatient to proceed logically and methodically, but locking your sights on a distant goal can help to assure your success."
virgo,2011-05-10,"You might not want to participate in social activities now, but circumstances make it difficult to stay quietly behind the scenes. You need to concentrate on what's happening, but there aren't many subjects you are compelled to talk about. Take your time and explore the mysteries of the unknown, for that's where you'll make meaningful connections, especially if you share your discoveries with someone you trust."
libra,2011-05-10,"You may be feeling as if time is running out, now that it's the last day of energetic Mars' visit to your 7th House of Others. Thankfully, you feel more alive because your relationships have grown more intense. But it's time to stabilize your interactions with your friends and associates, rather than allowing the stress to get the best of you. Instead of worrying about what you receive from your partners, turn the tables and show your generosity of spirit by being of service of others."
scorpio,2011-05-10,"Your feelings are on edge today as the Moon's square to the persistent Taurus Sun stresses you out. You may have been spending too much time on the Magical Mystery Tour, but now it's time to put your nose to the grindstone so you can make critical decisions about your future. But there's no need to push the panic button. Set your frustrations aside and connect with others while you can."
sagittarius,2011-05-10,"Although your close-up vision isn't very good today, you might feel as if you can see forever. You look out to the horizon and you are certain that the distance has moved even farther away. But this trick of the light enables you to visualize your future while you manage your current schedule. Set the notion of immediate gratification aside. Once you remove the pressure, you may have an easier time reaching your goals."
capricorn,2011-05-10,"Your anxiety runs deep now because you know how important it is to stay on track and complete everything you have promised. But the temptation of having a good time looms large today and it may be hard to resist. Fortunately, you can work hard to meet your previous obligations and then still have enough time left over for some serious recreation."
aquarius,2011-05-10,"Your day may be hijacked by friends who feel the need to share their relationship dramas. Whether it's a new acquaintance or an old romantic partner, it could appear as if someone is trying to limit your personal freedom. Expressing yourself independently is extremely critical now because of its natural rejuvenating power. You won't have much left to give others unless you take some time to please yourself."
pisces,2011-05-10,"Your work-related tasks seem more tedious today, which could make you feel unusually restless. Your solution might be to shake everything up in order to turn a dull job into a field day for the curious. Don't be afraid to assume power on the job. Fortunately, you should be able to use your authority effectively to accomplish more at work while in pursuit of your higher purpose."
aries,2011-05-11,"You can sense the change in energy as your key planet Mars leaves exciting Aries for the more restful ground of Taurus. But your hopes are still running high because you feel lucky. And even if things don't fall your way today, you're able to set aside your expectations and enjoy yourself anyhow. If boredom turns to dissatisfaction, come back to the present moment where you can change your attitude and upgrade the entire day."
taurus,2011-05-11,"You might break out in spontaneous fits of laughter today. Your key planet Venus receives a boost of confidence from boastful Jupiter, making it tough to be too serious. You aren't necessarily interested in hiding your glee now, but you don't necessarily want to flaunt it, either. Keep in mind that it's all about your attitude. No one will find fault with you for feeling good as long as you try to share your positive energy with your friends."
gemini,2011-05-11,"You are wrapped in a series of lovely social encounters today, yet something can still hold you back from fully enjoying yourself. Since you often keep your options open until the last minute, perhaps you are scared of getting stuck. Unfortunately, your fears have the power to prevent you from being really happy; don't let your negative thoughts hijack an otherwise positive day."
cancer,2011-05-11,"It's hard to trust what you hear today because everyone is prone to exaggeration during the Mercury-Venus-Jupiter conjunction. You might want to believe that what you're being told is true, yet your instincts also tell you that something isn't quite right. It all sounds a little too perfect, especially once you consider that your insecurities could make for an unnecessarily hard judge. If you let go of your fears and be open to what happens, you may be pleasantly surprised."
leo,2011-05-11,You should be happy with your production today as long as you can concentrate your attention on your goals. But you could end up blaming others for your own lack of focus if you don't get much work finished. Remember that there are a variety of ways to measure success and you might make significant progress now without having the results to show for it.
virgo,2011-05-11,"You are still running on the buzz of a creative high, yet you may be content now to take a nature walk, stroll through a museum or listen to a new band. Unfortunately, no matter what you do, the inspiration must ultimately come from within. Therefore, you will be happier today if you don't avoid the hard work of making something yourself. Sharing your gifts with others could feel like a heavy responsibility unless it comes from the heart."
libra,2011-05-11,"You are quite upbeat about a relationship that might have had you feeling down only a few days ago. Thankfully, luck is on your side now as your key planet Venus aligns with jovial Jupiter. Nevertheless, over-confidence can make things tricky if you follow your bliss without thinking about someone else's feelings. As always, it's smart to ask others what they want before forging blindly ahead with your plans."
scorpio,2011-05-11,"This is a propitious day to begin a major project because whatever you do now will likely be blessed. Although wealth and happiness may be temporary, today's joyful Venus-Jupiter conjunction makes the material world more tempting than usual. Your willpower is on the line, so keep striving toward living the kind of life you want to lead without letting extravagant behavior pull you off course."
sagittarius,2011-05-11,You are likely to exaggerate the facts today as your key planet Jupiter magnifies talkative Mercury. You could become obsessive about an idea that seems important enough to take over your whole day. But practicing a bit of sensible restraint may be enough to prevent you from going overboard. It's not necessary to go to the other extreme by pushing away a potentially enjoyable experience. Just be smart and establish limits so you don't get into trouble later for forgetting to stop.
capricorn,2011-05-11,"Your friends might think that you're overreacting by turning a molehill into a mountain today. However, you are much more stable than you sound. There are two entirely different perspectives unfolding now. The first is about your eagerness to try nearly anything new. The other story is about your unflappable determination. Remember, there is a calm you can find when you dive deep beneath the rough waters on the surface."
aquarius,2011-05-11,"You may feel invincible today, but your secret weapon is safe from the inquisitive minds of others. This anonymity is because your current power stems from your subconscious mind that's beyond the sensory perceptions of anyone else. Although you may be tempted to explore these hidden non-physical realms, don't lose touch with the real world in the process."
pisces,2011-05-11,"You might be confused by your current optimism today, especially if others seem to be critical of your new plans. You don't understand their negativity and may respond by placing more credence in hope than in hardcore planning. However, attending to details now should pay off. If you can keep your unrestrained enthusiasm in check, you have an excellent chance to make some money and even have a bit of fun along the way."
aries,2011-05-12,"You are normally reluctant to show your vulnerability, often covering it by initiating action instead of waiting for something to happen. But your ruling planet Mars slipped out of your sign yesterday, leaving you open to someone's harsh criticism. Thankfully, witty Mercury and charming Venus come to the rescue today by overriding any self-doubt. Talking your way out of a difficult situation is admirable as long as you also remain open to what others say."
taurus,2011-05-12,"Although the days keep getting busier and busier, you are becoming more adept at blocking out the excess noise. The choice is yours; you can also walk away instead of engaging in all the commotion. Make use of the time you gain by relaxing in a quiet space. Meditating or daydreaming can help you recharge your batteries today. If you're lucky, you might not even be missed when you slip away for your little escape."
gemini,2011-05-12,"You may reconsider your previous plans for the day because you might want to add even more activities to your schedule. However, it's possible to take the power of positive thinking too far today. Your blind optimism could tempt you to overcommit, letting others down and leaving you discouraged. Be cautious; managing your time wisely enables you to accomplish more than you thought possible and could even prevent an unnecessary disaster."
cancer,2011-05-12,"Although you have more confidence about a recent career decision today, you aren't as driven to reach your goal immediately. Your newfound certainty allows you to cut yourself some slack and take it a bit easier for a day or two. But don't stretch this little break too long or you could fall behind. Set your long-term goals now and work at a pace that enables you to sustain your efforts."
leo,2011-05-12,"You have grown quite content recently to enjoy simple pleasures whenever you get the chance. You don't need to tell everyone about your inner process, so keeping your feelings to yourself today will serve you well. However, you have things to do now and it would not be wise to put off your current obligations. Instead of hurrying through your tasks so you can relax later, try moving slower and taking the time to smell the flowers and savor the coffee along the way."
virgo,2011-05-12,"The Moon's entry into your sign today places you in touch with a feeling that you may have attempted to avoid. You're not interested in being the leader now and prefer to be just another person in the crowd. But let's face it; everyone isn't as committed to perfection as you are. Fortunately, you're able to work well with others by relaxing your exacting performance standards. Sometimes it's more important to just get the job done."
libra,2011-05-12,"You may be concerned about making a decision that has a direct impact on others at work and you're not willing to determine the outcome on your own. Normally, you would just take a few steps back and let someone else assume leadership responsibility. But it might be impossible to pass the buck today; check in with your intuition before speaking up and committing to a plan."
scorpio,2011-05-12,"Don't waste too much time with analysis today because rational thinking won't bring you the best answers. The realms of thought can only take you so far. Instead, trust your intuition now because your psychic radar is right on track. Don't try to explain your decisions to anyone; just listen to your gut."
sagittarius,2011-05-12,"You seem to be enjoying yourself today as loving Venus and talkative Mercury both party with your key planet Jupiter. Still, you may be slightly worried that you're missing something very important. Go about your regular business, but take a bit of time to make sure you don't glide over unexpressed feelings that need to be addressed. Put away your clever one-liners and move past your own resistance to explore deeper and more personal issues."
capricorn,2011-05-12,"Someone may be very attuned to you today, but you could be so busy working toward your goals that you don't even notice. However, connecting with others can make a big difference, so don't fearfully withdraw because you are worried about appearing vulnerable or dependent. Take the initiative and share your concerns with a trusted friend. You may be pleasantly surprised by the positive reaction to your disclosure."
aquarius,2011-05-12,"You are actively engaged with your immediate environment today and everything seems to be fine as long as you don't stop moving. You may believe that you don't have time to get bogged down by your emotions. However, slowing down long enough to consider the meaning of what's happening in your life might be the smartest thing you can do. Fortunately, once you are back in touch with your feelings, everything will seem better than it was earlier in the day when you were stuck inside your head."
pisces,2011-05-12,"Although you might be feeling more content today, your life is busier than you prefer. It's okay to be satisfied with your recent job performance, even if someone is on your case now because you didn't pay enough attention to the details on a project. Thankfully, your happiness isn't dependent on external events or the opinions of others. Integrating your own values into whatever you do is more important than receiving approval from anyone else."
aries,2011-05-13,"Your day may get off to a bad start, but don't hold on to any feelings of negativity or they might become obstacles to getting your way. Your workmates are willing to give you the support you want now, but you have to meet them halfway. You are naturally spontaneous, making you acutely aware of the advantage of focusing on the present; consider your current situation without dwelling on your past."
taurus,2011-05-13,"No matter how self-confident you feel now, there are still pragmatic reasons why it's not wise to charge ahead and take what you want. Luckily, you're willing to wait and your patience serves you well. Acting too forceful would only complicate things, but taking small, determined steps should increase the chances of reaching your desired destination."
gemini,2011-05-13,"Someone may misinterpret your actions today, for shady Pluto aspects the Sun hiding in your 12th House of Secrets. Fortunately, throughout the day it grows easier to say what needs to be said, but you might not overcome the resistance without an open conflict. Don't back down, even if you must stand up to another person's power trip. Ultimately, your persistence and clear conscience will work to your advantage."
cancer,2011-05-13,"Your ambivalence is apparent today if someone demands that you take sides in an open disagreement at work. Although you might have a distinct preference, you're hesitant to express your opinion because you understand both sides of the issue. Ultimately, you're aware that you're an observer and the conflict isn't necessarily your problem. Even if you're willing to lend a sympathetic ear, this distraction can affect your productivity. Stand firm in your impartiality to allow others the chance to find a quick resolution on their own."
leo,2011-05-13,"The Moon's entry into your 3rd House of Information means that you must make some difficult choices about your schedule. You're tempted to cram a lot into a small amount of time, but it might be smarter to simply let the day unfold with as few commitments as possible. There's a sensible wisdom in being flexible to the changing winds, like a kite remains open to the fickle breezes of spring. Stay unattached to the clock today to increase your chances of grabbing an amazing opportunity if it appears out of the blue."
virgo,2011-05-13,"You know what you need to do to reach your current goal; however, you might actually prefer to be doing something very different now. Your struggle over this apparently irresolvable dilemma can be very intense. Thankfully, you have a greater degree of control than you think. Remember that your happiness is not dependent on any one event, but rather on how you respond to life's twists and turns. Your resilience may be tested today, but you're up for the challenge."
libra,2011-05-13,"You may experience an uncharacteristic emotional meltdown this morning, which clears the air of bad feelings and allows you to get back to business. Fortunately, getting along with others isn't all that difficult when you care about the same issues. Sadly, someone may be dishonest with you today, making you unsympathetic to an alternative perspective. Still, it's wise to suspend your judgment for a while and be as gracious to others as possible."
scorpio,2011-05-13,"Your patience has worn thin, even if your intentions are good. You're tired of the same old issues coming up again and again, even though you have processed them and moved on. Fortunately, you can tell that others are really trying to change and you may already see positive movement. But it might not be happening fast enough and you don't feel like waiting any longer. Being honest and expressing your frustrations in a calm manner reduces the tension and strengthens a key relationship."
sagittarius,2011-05-13,"You may be known for your social charm, and this usually works in your favor. However, you must exercise self-restraint now or your exuberant style might offend someone important. But rather than withdrawing completely, try toning down your enthusiasm just a touch. Keep in mind that self-discipline doesn't mean you have to remain silent; it's about saying the right thing succinctly. It's crucial to know how much to say and when to stop talking."
capricorn,2011-05-13,"You may be angry if someone sends you mixed signals today, asking you to do something and then instructing you to back off. You might not have a strong preference about what you should do, but you aren't happy with the uncertainty that's raised with the change of plans. Don't push for clarification; you could inadvertently open a can of worms that's better left alone. Accept the lack of direction now instead of wasting your energy trying to capture elusive resolution."
aquarius,2011-05-13,"You're on the edge of a breakthrough today, but you are probably juggling too many tasks to follow up on any one of them. Thankfully, your routine work assignments won't necessarily prevent you from pursuing a more interesting adventure. Your commitment will probably mean working late hours, but you can meet all your obligations while still having sufficient time to explore a more inspiring path."
pisces,2011-05-13,"Your subconscious is sending you powerful messages today, yet they may stem from old fears rather than from current events. Ironically, the more time you put into analyzing your memories, the more intense your feelings become. There's nothing to be gained by feeding your negative fantasies; instead of worrying about something that's well in your past, focus all your attention on what's happening now."
aries,2011-05-14,"As much as you want to be practical today, it's tough to finish all your chores because interruptions continue to catch you off guard. However, there are only a certain number of hours in the day so you cannot waste your time on unimportant activities. You have a chance now to demonstrate what you can accomplish if you remain focused, so don't allow your mind to drift too far off track."
taurus,2011-05-14,"Managing your time wisely today allows you to be extra productive and your determination gives you the ability to stay on schedule.

But don't be overly concerned about working quickly; if you establish your own pace and do the job correctly from the beginning, you will arrive at your destination just on time."
gemini,2011-05-14,"Although you are quite serious today, you may not be all that quiet. You could be your regular talkative self, even if you're more concerned with substantial issues now than you are with witty banter. It doesn't matter if someone thinks you're a wet blanket because your somber tone is only temporary. Even if others expect you to be the life of the party, it's okay to acknowledge that life is not just fun and games."
cancer,2011-05-14,"Your schedule may be less forgiving today and it won't be easy to alter your previously made plans. In fact, you could exhaust yourself by resisting the prevailing currents now. Instead, remain flexible and flow with your existing commitments the best you can. Don't harbor any resentment, even if you wish you could do something else. If you maintain a positive attitude and a healthy sense of humor, the day will be more pleasant for everyone involved."
leo,2011-05-14,"The determined Taurus Sun motivates you to complete whatever you begin, but your intentions may be obscured by restrictive Saturn today. You probably won't mind turning down your volume for a while because a bit of self-restraint allows you to shine your light longer than usual. If others lean on you now, it's because they can sense that you're very serious about following through with your promises. However, don't stress yourself out trying to live up to someone else's expectations; doing the best you can is all that anyone can ask."
virgo,2011-05-14,"You are very committed to doing a good job today, yet you can accomplish a lot without appearing to work hard. Paradoxically, you may look like you're having more fun than you really are now, because you're anxious about what others will think if your finished product isn't good enough. Thankfully, you don't need to worry so much because you are a more critical judge than most of your peers."
libra,2011-05-14,"The Moon's return to gracious Libra is a gentle reminder that treating others kindly really does make you feel good, too. But the Moon's conjunction to hardworking Saturn can stir up issues of resentment today because you wish that someone else would take care of you for a change. However, this isn't a good day for rebellious behavior. Although you might hit an emotional rough patch, maintaining the peace should still be your top priority."
scorpio,2011-05-14,"The Moon's visit to your 12th House of Secrets emphasizes your behind-the-scenes role today. Unfortunately, you are not satisfied being an invisible helper and could have a meltdown in front of everyone. Although you might like assisting others, you also require time to explore your own emotional issues. Don't resist nurturing yourself, even if you're worried about appearing selfish. If you don't look after your own needs, you won't have enough energy to look after anyone else's."
sagittarius,2011-05-14,"You have things to do now and strategic planning can help you accomplish what's on your agenda. Normally, you might have a difficult time turning down an invitation to a social function, but today you are able to act with restraint. It's not that you want to avoid the fun; it's just a matter of priorities and you have more serious thoughts on your mind. It's important to be responsible, but you don't necessarily have to ignore your friends to accomplish your goals."
capricorn,2011-05-14,"The radiant Sun and energetic Mars are now dancing through your 5th House of Self-Expression, encouraging you to approach your day in a lighthearted manner. But the Moon's conjunction with your key planet Saturn in your 10th House of Public Responsibility can rain on your parade by squelching your creativity. Don't bother wasting too much time trying to force spontaneity today; initiating one carefully considered action is smarter than behaving recklessly."
aquarius,2011-05-14,You are pulled between needing to get out to do something exciting and isolating yourself from the rest of the world by staying home. But neither extreme will be possible since you probably have weekend chores to do today. Your friends might not even realize how dissatisfied you are now because you are so masterful at hiding your unfulfilled desires behind a facade of busyness. Be careful or you could end up misleading yourself by slipping into denial.
pisces,2011-05-14,"Your responsibilities have grown in complexity and it's no longer sufficient to just fulfill your promises. Things have changed as your awareness has grown over the past month. Now you must integrate your recent spiritual lessons into your everyday life. It's not enough to write about your experiences like schoolchildren report on their summer vacations. Instead, recapture the intensity of your awakening by taking your new perspective to heart."
aries,2011-05-15,"Even if you take the time to share your point of view with those close to you, they may not acknowledge your feelings. Apparently, you might not be communicating as clearly as you think or, maybe, someone else just can't see beyond his or her assumptions. You could inadvertently increase everyone's frustration level if you keep trying to say the same thing. It's probably more sensible to start over again in a day or two. Your chances of being heard are better once your emotions have settled."
taurus,2011-05-15,"You might hold back your feelings if something goes wrong today because you don't want to stir up any more trouble. Although you believe that your strategy is based on common sense, your unexpressed feelings can create fallout of their own. Someone might think you are hard to get along with because you're not participating in the discussion. It's best in the long run to say what's on your mind without placing blame on anyone else."
gemini,2011-05-15,"You are quite willing to express your feelings of attraction now to someone you admire. You could be inclined to take care of a close friend, because doing things for others might be the safest way for you to share your love today. Even if your intentions are good, allow plenty of emotional space so you don't smother anyone with your need for affection."
cancer,2011-05-15,"Your frustration with others today may ultimately stem from your own discomfort. You would like to be more emotionally detached so your feelings don't interfere with having a good time. Unfortunately, intellectualizing your reactions by telling everyone that you're okay won't necessarily work, because you don't sound like you mean it. When you realize that you don't need to share your opinions on everything that happens, you'll be free from projecting your fears onto anyone else."
leo,2011-05-15,"It's difficult to keep your emotions from influencing your objectivity, even if you recognize that it's smarter to stay neutral today. Ironically, you are more flexible than you sound because your words convey a high level of certainty that makes you seem unwilling to negotiate. Be as open as possible and let others know you haven't made up your mind and that you're willing to listen to their point of view."
virgo,2011-05-15,"You find it challenging to demonstrate your authority today because others want you to justify your choices. Unfortunately, you don't share the same need for closure now and you're content to sit on the fence as a conversation unfolds. You're eager to take either position just to keep the discussion going, but you might not be ready to make up your mind. Don't let anyone else's sense of urgency force you to give your final answer until you're ready."
libra,2011-05-15,"Your feelings swing like a pendulum today as you try to get comfortable with your changing moods. But even if you do find peace with the rise and fall of your emotional tides, your inconsistency may grate on others. You might try to convince someone that you aren't attached to any particular outcome, only to get angry later in the day when things don't go your way. Exhibiting a bit of self-control will help now because losing your temper won't make anyone happy."
scorpio,2011-05-15,"The Moon's opposition to four planets and her return to your sign indicate that you could get bent out of shape if you cannot find the peace and quiet that you want. Taking some time off sounds like a good idea, but the demands of others might make your escape impossible. Isolation can be reassuring if it offers you the space you need to think about an unresolved issue, without having to report every thought back to someone else. Enjoy your solitude when it finally arrives."
sagittarius,2011-05-15,"You are pulled between extremes today -- doing the casual social thing and digging deeper to get to the bottom of a spiritual dilemma. Thankfully, you are able to play both ends of the spectrum now, without having to choose one over the other until you are ready. Give yourself permission to respond to circumstances and make the most of each moment, whether you are enjoying the company of your friends or solving the mysteries of the universe."
capricorn,2011-05-15,"Allow extra time today to acknowledge that your life is less complicated, even if it doesn't appear that it will last. It's wise to receive the good will that comes your way now, although you might not get much work accomplished. If someone special wants to nurture you, don't put up a fight. Accepting love with an open heart is the right thing to do, even if it makes you feel a bit uncomfortable at first."
aquarius,2011-05-15,"Your feelings take you on a journey today and there really isn't much to be gained by resisting the sojourn. Fortunately, you won't cause any harm by just floating off into Fantasyland. It's crucial for you to escape from the routine now, even if you can't really go anywhere at all. If you keep up appearances by quietly fulfilling your responsibilities, you'll be able to travel in your mind wherever you please."
pisces,2011-05-15,"You may attempt to sidestep your emotions now, at least long enough to dig into a complex problem. However, you can't separate your opinions from the answers you seek. Being aware of your bias, though, can make all the difference in the world. There's no need for you to pretend that you are just a rational scientist when, in fact, you are also a passionate artist. Integrating your head and your heart into each situation will broaden your experience."
aries,2011-05-16,"You don't care about logic today; if you want to do something, no one will be able to talk you out of your plan. You might even be willing to conveniently forget about your obligations, although you'll probably create trouble for yourself by your irresponsible behavior. Using your common sense can save the day. Take a moment and think about the consequences before impulsively running off to pursue pleasure. You will have a better time if you fulfill your responsibilities first."
taurus,2011-05-16,"You get off to a slow start this morning, so it may be tough to motivate yourself. You have no problem visualizing the amazing things you could be doing, but your dreams won't become real on their own. You may have to set aside concerns of comfort and be willing to work extra hard today. Although you are being asked to stretch yourself now, you will feel a great deal of satisfaction if you have something positive to show for your efforts by the end of the day."
gemini,2011-05-16,"Your need for peace and quiet may tempt you to withdraw from unnecessary social interactions today, even if your friends want you to join them for some fun. You're not willing to just go along for the ride now, especially if it appears that the excitement will outweigh the serenity. You have enough work to do so you aren't interested in wasting your energy when it could be applied toward more useful endeavors. Take care of important business and save your playtime for the weekend."
cancer,2011-05-16,"It's difficult to speak your mind without having a plan today. You would prefer to figure out what you're going to say before sharing your thoughts with your friends or associates. However, you may be able to explore your alternatives out loud if you feel very comfortable with the others in your group. Ideally, your best bet will be to test a couple of your options on a friendly audience, if given the chance."
leo,2011-05-16,"Your co-worker or friend may be exaggerating today, but you will most likely take what you hear at face value. Your natural generosity of spirit enables you to give others the benefit of the doubt. Trusting someone else might initiate an emotional connection that adds value to your life. Although you must be ready to jump in with the right person when an opportunity is presented, make sure that you feel comfortable with the situation before you leap."
virgo,2011-05-16,"You can become quite obsessed with making plans for an upcoming adventure, but your innate powers of discrimination may fall to the wayside as you try to finalize your strategy. You might skim over the details and miss something important while you justify what you want now with opinions rather than facts. But you won't find satisfaction if you race toward the wrong destination. Slow down and reconsider your assumptions. Rethinking your current approach can save you from running into obstacles down the road."
libra,2011-05-16,"Your key planet Venus is visiting dreamland today as she sextiles imaginative Neptune, making this a fairytale day that brings you love. Unfortunately, an idyllic fantasy might not last as long as you wish. Although there may be opportunities for romance, the mysterious Scorpio Moon increases your need to go deep. Happiness depends upon finding a balance between lighthearted pleasures and passionate explorations. You don't have to miss out on the fun, yet entertaining unrealistic hopes could lead to disappointment."
scorpio,2011-05-16,"Your current notion of personal satisfaction doesn't require approval from someone else. Enjoying yourself now is more about your internal state than what anyone else thinks. Retreating into your own world as the Moon moves through your introspective sign can be quite productive. But you must also remain vigilant, for you are tempted to just relax and take it easy. Living in the moment has its upside, but you can be very self-judgmental if you don't finish your work."
sagittarius,2011-05-16,"You might believe that you have a healthy attitude about balancing work and play, but your responsibilities will pile up very quickly today if you don't stay focused on them. Although sweet distractions can break your concentration, you are blessed with an extraordinary level of willpower now. Don't be self-critical if you slip; just redirect your attention onto your current chores and keep moving forward one step at a time."
capricorn,2011-05-16,"Some people mistakenly think that you Mountain Goats don't know how to enjoy yourself. Today is a day when you can happily prove them wrong. There are four planets now dancing in your 5th House of Spontaneous Pleasure, enabling you to emotionally detach yourself from unfulfilled responsibilities. Once you're ready to play, you won't need to justify your actions to anyone else. Fortunately, you could be even more productive after you have had some well-deserved fun."
aquarius,2011-05-16,"Although you may be floating on a Neptunian cloud today, it's still a challenge to let go of someone else's expectations, especially if others are depending on you. But you don't have to succumb to their pressures and deadlines. You can obtain great benefit from setting your regular workday aside for a while. Take some wellness time for yourself, if you can; your responsibilities will wait for your return."
pisces,2011-05-16,"You may feel bogged down in your everyday routines, leading you to spend more time dreaming of a different life. But breaking free from old habits might be tougher than it appears. Although the anticipation lures you into new ground today, saying something contrary to the status quo can be a bit disconcerting. Instead of trying to change your situation, consciously alter your attitude first. This may be sufficient to shift your experience out of a rut and gradually into a different direction."
aries,2011-05-17,"Following your desires can really get your adrenaline pumping, but things can become more complicated than you bargain for now. You must be cautious when expressing your needs today because it can be difficult to stop once you stir up some excitement. Although you can talk yourself into risky behavior, it might not be such a good idea. Believe it or not, sometimes your feelings should be kept to yourself."
taurus,2011-05-17,"You may be overcommitted in a relationship now, making you feel as if you won't be able to deliver on what you promised. You are normally able to manage your time and resources without difficulty, but today you should be extra careful with your assumptions. You might not even notice that you have taken on too much until it's too late to change your course. Nonetheless, you would still be wise to reconsider your plans and reset your goals once you realize that you made a mistake."
gemini,2011-05-17,"Your daily regimen has a significant effect on your overall health, and today's stress makes you stop and consider how to make things better. It's not wise to turn your life upside down all at once. However, you can make a small improvement by doing something that builds your strength and rejuvenates you without making your day any more chaotic. Even a slight upgrade to your current exercise program or a minor modification to your diet could be sufficient to increase your feelings of well-being."
cancer,2011-05-17,"You could take a relationship too seriously now and try to transform a casual friendship into a full-blown romance. It seems as if it would be easier to lighten the emotional weight, but the Full Moon's presence in your 5th House of Romance may mean that your feelings are beyond your conscious control. Don't try to redirect what is in your heart; just let the currents carry you along for the ride. Remember, it's prudent to observe your changing desires without impulsively acting on every one."
leo,2011-05-17,"You may be misled by a close friend or family member who is very convincing today. It isn't that you're gullible, but you do tend to trust others if they appear to know what they are doing. Exercise extra caution by investigating more than usual before making any promises you'll later regret. Withholding your strongest desires might be your best move until you can tell what's really going on."
virgo,2011-05-17,"You could have a really great idea today that sweeps you away with your own grandiose thinking. You might attempt to keep everything in a practical perspective, but your point of view is bent out of shape by your belief in your own story. Thankfully, you're able to minimize any problems that arise from inflating a sensible strategy into an overextended one. Wait until next week to finalize your plans."
libra,2011-05-17,"Today's Full Moon in your 2nd House of Resources indicates that you might need to be extra careful about spending money on discretionary activities. You may agree to a purchase prior to thinking through the real costs. If you're unsure of what to do, get advice from a trustworthy friend or a financial expert. Thankfully, involving someone else in your decision-making process will bring clarity as to whether or not you can really afford satisfying your desires now."
scorpio,2011-05-17,"The Full Moon in passionate Scorpio emphasizes the urgency of your feelings. It may seem as if time has run out, making you aware of how much work you have on your plate today. You might have to postpone your previously scheduled escape to finish a project that's on a very tight schedule. You would be wise now to acknowledge your frustration and delay the fun, rather than turning a difficult deadline into an impossible one."
sagittarius,2011-05-17,"Your schedule may be totally booked, yet you're still able to turn your work into fun. However, it probably won't unfold the way you planned it. Your temporary lack of judgment encourages you to get involved in one too many projects now. Ultimately, it's less stressful for you and certainly more considerate of everyone else if you set sensible limits before making any more promises you can't keep."
capricorn,2011-05-17,"You may be overloaded with commitments because today's Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 11th House of Social Networking. You want to be more involved with others, even if you don't have enough time for yourself. But avoiding your responsibilities won't solve anything. Delaying the inevitable just makes you even more nervous. If possible, take a little time off for some play, but not at the expense of fulfilling your obligations."
aquarius,2011-05-17,"You want others to acknowledge your wisdom by coming to you for advice, and you might even feel hurt if they ask someone else for help first. However, your motives may not be completely clear today. You could be more interested in being distracted from your own problems now than you are in solving anyone else's predicaments. Fortunately, you can still be of assistance to those you love, no matter what your reasons are at this time."
pisces,2011-05-17,"Today's Full Moon in your 9th House of Higher Education may indicate your need to make an important decision about going back to school. If you have been dreaming about furthering your studies, this is your chance to pursue something completely different from your current interests. Unfortunately, you must think about the unrealistic side of your dreams. But rather than setting your plans aside, try modifying them to align more closely with reality. Bringing your vision down to earth makes it simpler to manifest."
aries,2011-05-18,"Your impatience could get the best of you today. Even if you have important responsibilities to fulfill, you still might try to sidestep them so you have time for more pleasurable activities, too. Although you could feel invincible now, you probably won't be able to escape unnoticed. Don't be surprised if you are held accountable for any inconsiderate actions. As is often the case for you, thinking about the consequences before leaping into action is the smartest strategy."
taurus,2011-05-18,"It's not productive to spend too much time questioning your values today, even if someone's behavior makes you wonder about your own priorities. Nevertheless, your desires may not be as altruistic as someone else's now. Keep in mind that everyone is different and comparing yourself to anyone else is a pointless exercise. What's most important is simply being true to yourself."
gemini,2011-05-18,"The enthusiastic Sagittarius Moon is visiting your 7th House of Partners, indicating that others may encourage you to take on more than you want to handle. Fortunately, you can be revitalized by what you accomplish if you agree to participate in someone's project. But you might already be busy today, and turning down an invitation could place you in an awkward position. Nevertheless, it's better to be honest now than sorry later."
cancer,2011-05-18,"You may be rather surprised with your current willingness to get involved in someone's plan now, especially if you need to relinquish control. It might even be a relief to be a passenger without having to also play the role of a back seat driver. It doesn't matter what kind of activities you have on your calendar; the thought of doing something different today brings a smile to your face."
leo,2011-05-18,"The upbeat Sagittarius Moon is traveling through your playful 5th house now, giving you the green light to kick up your heels and have fun. No matter how busy you are, make a little time today just for yourself. Get outside for a walk, schedule a massage, or do something creative that helps you to unwind. Take care of yourself and recharge your batteries. Today, it's truly all about you."
virgo,2011-05-18,"Usually others rely on you to think critically and analyze the situation. But you may not be very logical now because you're seeing the world through a very optimistic lens. Fortunately, your life could be in really good shape, but you still might be happier if you delay an important decision and simply enjoy yourself today. The Moon's visit to your 4th House of Family suggests that you should take time to relax at home instead of making your imprint on the world. Even if there's plenty of work to do, grab the chance to play for a while, instead."
libra,2011-05-18,"Your idea of making it through the day might not include keeping so busy that you cannot find a moment to relax. Unfortunately, you may not have time to slow down and enjoy yourself. Thankfully, your willingness to be flexible can be your secret weapon, allowing you to have fun while maintaining your hectic schedule. You can always do what you wish on another day."
scorpio,2011-05-18,"You may be lost in your current exploration of grandiose ideas about what you want to accomplish now, but you won't make much progress if you try to do too much. Your energy level is high, enabling you to respond to others quickly, but you can easily burn through your reserves faster than you expect. You might think that you're like the Energizer Bunny, but it's smarter to react slowly and steadily like the tortoise if you want to finish the race."
sagittarius,2011-05-18,"You cannot contain your excitement now that the Moon is back in your enthusiastic sign. You are already aware that you are dealing with some challenging issues, and this increases your desire to have some fun now, while you can. Don't waste energy feeling guilty about being spontaneous and avoiding your responsibilities. If you're not gone for too long, you can slip back and finish your chores before anyone realizes that you stepped away."
capricorn,2011-05-18,"Playing down your confidence is one way of sneaking in below the radar today. If your co-workers are aware of your positive energy, they will likely expect even more from you. However, if they can't see the glint in your eye, you could get away with some mischievous behavior. Your strategy may be sound, but your plan can backfire. You'll have a better shot at having fun now by letting the good times roll instead of holding yourself back."
aquarius,2011-05-18,"Your friends are the source of inspiration today as they include you in their adventurous plans. Unfortunately, things get complicated when there are overlapping events because you can't do two things simultaneously. Make choices early in the day to lessen the stress that will arise if you try to juggle too many activities. For now, less is still better than more."
pisces,2011-05-18,"The Moon's current visit to your 10th House of Public Responsibility can temporarily turn you into a mother hen as you realize how much others need your help. But you would be wise to carefully examine your motives, even if you think that your intentions are honorable. Your need to save another lost soul and cure the sick is admirable if you are driven by true compassion. But your assistance might not be as helpful as you think if you're trying to prove to others how much you care."
aries,2011-05-19,"You aren't thrilled with your heavy workload, but you're resigned with what you must do today. You need to confront your temptation to procrastinate; distracting yourself from your obligations is fruitless. If you make up your mind to focus your intentions with all your might, you should be able to rein in your scattered energy, harness your unrealized power and have a productive day in spite of yourself."
taurus,2011-05-19,"It seems like a fantastic day to complete a project, but things might not go according to your plan if you aren't persistent. There is a lot of mental interference today and it could be tempting to set your agenda aside and follow a whim. Thankfully, your common sense should ultimately override your need to escape. You can turn a dream into reality now if you pick one track and follow your chosen course with determination."
gemini,2011-05-19,"Someone may look at you with total bewilderment today, amazed that you can appear so busy while getting so little done. Ironically, you might feel as if you're doing everything just right, without noticing how much energy you're actually wasting. However, you can turn fortune in your favor by consciously slowing down. Deliberating on your ideas and thinking through the consequences of your actions will certainly be more effective now than simply flying by the seat of your pants."
cancer,2011-05-19,"Although you sometimes tend to be very cautious, it may be refreshing today to just act on your feelings without going through endless analysis. Normally, you are more successful when you contemplate your next move before you do anything. But making every decision as if you're playing a game of chess takes all the excitement out of your life. Instead, give yourself permission to react from your gut; getting things out into the open will make you feel much better."
leo,2011-05-19,"You have a lot on your plate today, especially if you end up wasting too much time this morning. But your responsibilities will be more demanding and your schedule less forgiving as the afternoon unfolds. Nevertheless, avoid getting so caught up in your own agenda that you won't be able to see what's right in front of you. Remaining flexible enables you to respond positively to something quite unexpected."
virgo,2011-05-19,"Your energy reserves grow deeper throughout the day, raising your confidence about a current creative project. Unfortunately, it isn't sufficient to be productive today; you also want to enjoy yourself while you work now. However, don't use your personal desires as a reason to sabotage your efforts if you're not having a good time. Stay on track and demonstrate your competence; your satisfaction of a job well done will be enough of a reason to celebrate."
libra,2011-05-19,"No matter how grounded you try to be today, you'll still be able to see beyond your normal boundaries, enabling you to gain a whole new perspective about your life. You can suddenly recognize how your current efforts mesh with your plans for the future in a way you hadn't yet grasped, especially if you were only interested in completing your job. Don't worry; you will do your best work in the long run by finishing what you can on your own timetable, not someone else's."
scorpio,2011-05-19,"You may become so worked up over doing something perfectly that it is difficult to concentrate now. Even if you are tired because you have been working late into the night, take stock of what you have already accomplished and let others know what you have left to do. Don't waste energy on self-judgment; just get some rest today and tomorrow you will feel refreshed and ready for anything."
sagittarius,2011-05-19,"If you have been pushing yourself too hard lately, it's time to exercise a bit of caution now. You may still be tempted to take on too much or promise more than you can deliver, but the calculating Capricorn Moon helps you plan your schedule with efficiency in mind. Your key to success now is pretty simple: make your energy last longer by doing less. Once you start creating boundaries, you'll finally have time to finish what you have already started."
capricorn,2011-05-19,"The Moon's monthly return to your sign today empowers you to express your emotional side. However, your friends may be surprised and dismayed with your uncharacteristic intensity. They might withdraw from the conversation, but they won't openly disagree, even if they think that you are wrong. Do yourself a big favor and tone down your fervor. Being passionately engaged with a meaningful cause is one thing, but trying to persuade others won't help you reach your goals."
aquarius,2011-05-19,"You might be pulled into a complex melodrama now and there isn't an easy way to avoid it. You may sink into your emotions over the next few days and, like quicksand, the more you struggle to get out, the deeper it gets. Don't panic; your smartest strategy is to stop resisting. Listen to what others have to say and don't just push them away. Your gift is to be a sounding board for those who need it most."
pisces,2011-05-19,"You may be obsessed today with one particular idea that you have about your future. Or, you could grow afraid of being stuck on your current path, especially if you don't like where it's heading. In both situations your attachment or avoidance intensifies the situation and makes it more difficult to navigate through the circumstances. Loosening your mental grip allows you to have more options and regain a healthier perspective."
aries,2011-05-20,"People at work probably won't mess with you today because they can tell that you're not in a playful mood. They may even be afraid that you might strike back with vengeance to make your point of view very clear. However, you aren't necessarily interested in expending energy just to explain your position to everyone. You can define the rules of the game now, so simply state your boundaries and then move on."
taurus,2011-05-20,"You're like a Bull on a rampage today as you gain momentum and strive to reach your goals. You may not have any superpowers, but your determination can be so strong and your energy so raw that most obstacles will simply dissipate as you reach them. Nevertheless, it's not wise to be overconfident, for there is plenty of work yet to be done. Now is the best time to get busy."
gemini,2011-05-20,"You might not be the one in charge today, but others expect a lot from you anyway. You may feel frustrated if you're held accountable for a situation that's beyond your control. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to do the very best job you can. In the meantime, acknowledge your limits so you can reserve some energy for other tasks that might prove to be more rewarding."
cancer,2011-05-20,"Even if you are struggling to overcome other people's resistance to your ideas now, it makes sense to have a positive attitude when a powerful friend or ally comes to your rescue. Unfortunately, you may be tempted to misplace your fears onto someone who is actually on your side. It could take a conscious effort, but you don't have to automatically project your doubt. Be smart and graciously accept the help that's being offered today."
leo,2011-05-20,"If you have been waiting for the right moment to start off on a new career path, it's now time to get to work. Your past efforts may have been directed toward planning, meditating or repeating affirmations. However, today is about planting your feet firmly on the ground, facing your destination and taking one step after another. Your chances for success are better than ever if you have a realistic goal in mind."
virgo,2011-05-20,"You know what you want today, yet you understand that there's more to life than your immediate needs. You are also concerned with your larger dreams that may still be somewhat unformed. Naturally, you excel at making plans and then focusing on achieving each goal one at a time. However, it's also wise to stay loose now, so you can take advantage of an interesting opportunity that may come along. Your best strategy is to plan ahead while allowing room to react spontaneously."
libra,2011-05-20,"You may need to overcome a lack of self-confidence today so you can build on the foundation that you already created. Lean on the structures that are in place without thinking that you must start anew. Fortunately, someone may offer you an opportunity that doesn't necessarily pull you off track, but expands upon your work. Nevertheless, don't get distracted by possibilities that are not directly connected to your dreams. Consider all the pros and cons carefully before making your final decision."
scorpio,2011-05-20,"A harmonious trine between your two key planets, fiery Mars and formidable Pluto, means that you have the powerful force of your convictions driving you forward today. However, interacting with others presents many intriguing options. Unfortunately, too many choices can scatter your energy while concentration assures your success. Don't spend time lost in analysis; get out of your head and just follow your instincts. The direction you pick is less important than what you do along the way."
sagittarius,2011-05-20,"You are motivated by practical concerns today, which should enable you to accomplish a lot at work. If things are progressing smoothly, then don't let up on the pressure; make the most of the positive situation while it lasts. However, if obstacles keep cropping up, you would be wise to consider your role in creating the problems. Work cooperatively with any adversaries now, instead of against them."
capricorn,2011-05-20,"You are at the top of your creative game today because your emotions are directly in line with your intentions. Whatever you want to do feels within reach, empowering you to give voice to an idea and then put your thoughts into action without too much resistance. Remember, there's no hurry; you'll do better if you start off slowly, increasing your momentum as you go."
aquarius,2011-05-20,"You can be very loyal to people from your past, including old friends and family. Your personal commitment often includes defending and protecting those who are less fortunate. You might feel driven to help anyone in need, and your emotions are so passionate now that even an acquaintance at work can receive an extra boost of energy from you today. Don't hold back; your actions create more of a positive impact than you realize."
pisces,2011-05-20,"There is little time to waste today because you have important work to do. Not only can you make progress toward your own goals, but your actions may also influence others in a positive manner. When your friends and associates see what you are doing, they might become inspired by your success and seek to duplicate it. Trusting your instincts by listening to your heart is a good start, but you must follow through by initiating constructive action."
aries,2011-05-21,"Your key planet Mars continues to push you into some emotionally intense places today. Although you're up for the ride, you want to have an escape route just in case you need it. You could grow skittish if you feel cornered, but overreacting won't likely have a positive result. Succumbing to your worries about the future will only alert others to your anxiety. For now, it's smarter to relax and sink into your feelings than dream about being somewhere else."
taurus,2011-05-21,"Your unwavering determination is your greatest strength as you continue to express your love today, even in the face of a confusing situation. Venus in sensual Taurus harmonizes with passionate Pluto, allowing you to concentrate on the underlying feelings rather than being distracted by the surface noise. As long as you keep aiming deep, you won't be led off track by unimportant issues or temporary fears."
gemini,2011-05-21,"The Sun's return to your mentally agile sign helps you to maintain your balance if you are lured into unknown emotional territory. You may need to push past your own resistance and share your feelings, even if you're unsure of how the other person will react. Thankfully, the conversation will go much better than you expect as long as you don't freeze once you start talking. You might learn something new if you are truly willing to listen."
cancer,2011-05-21,"You may be in a deep and dark mood today as you attempt to reveal your strong feelings to a trusted ally. But your current sense of urgency might provoke frustration or anger if your friend isn't willing or able to match your emotions. It's useless trying to change anyone else; focus on your own inner process and work to transform your dissatisfaction into an appreciation of what you have, instead."
leo,2011-05-21,You may be tired of people at work being so nice to you now because it doesn't feel real. You might even see their propitiating behavior as a symptom of weakness. But it's not a smart idea to harden your stance in an ill-conceived plan designed to demonstrate your strength. You must learn that you can be strong and yielding at the same time. Recognizing the wisdom of being flexible with respect to your desires can help you sail through a very intense day.
virgo,2011-05-21,"You might try to narrow your focus and limit your distractions so you can concentrate on what you need to do today. Unfortunately, this strategy grows more difficult as your emotions are stirred and you set your heart on some distant destination. It's not about being smart or having the right data now; it's just foolhardy to ignore your feelings. You already know what you must do, and having more facts at your disposal won't make your choice any easier."
libra,2011-05-21,"You may be feeling pretty confident now about your current plans, but something is still gnawing away at the bottom of your imagination. You might be limited in what you can do today, especially if you're obsessing about a relationship from the past. Don't try to escape your history, rather, dig into it. After you can find your way around in the shadows of your subconscious, you'll also be able to navigate better in the light of reality."
scorpio,2011-05-21,"Your unexpressed anger can cool into ice and transform into resentment, which is more difficult to process. Fortunately, Venus' current trine to your key planet Pluto stimulates your emotions and prevents them from going quiet. It's easier than usual for you to let go and act on your intuition. Following your instincts now is your best insurance against fostering negativity. Taking the high road is surely your best option."
sagittarius,2011-05-21,"The Moon and Pluto are in your resourceful 2nd house, reminding you that issues of self-worth and net worth are inextricably intertwined, even if they seem like separate entities. Today you might be more self-confident because you can ride a new sense of power from your emotions. If your self-esteem is growing, consider cashing in on it and asking for a raise. Naturally, circumstances at work need to support your request, but in any case your contribution and your courage won't go unnoticed."
capricorn,2011-05-21,"You are still enjoying the pleasurable benefits of three planets visiting your 5th House of Spontaneity. Your involvement in a significant creative project or a new romance may be growing, and you're tempted to go overboard as you try to give the performance of your life. This can be quite a memorable day as long as you don't struggle to accomplish too much."
aquarius,2011-05-21,"It's refreshing to feel so creative now and you're excited knowing that your weekend could improve even more. But your easygoing attitude today is very deceptive. You may be able to skillfully disarm someone's aggression, yet you're still ready for serious business in a moment's notice. Use your ability to shift back and forth between the lighthearted and heavy-handed extremes, so you can make the most of every moment."
pisces,2011-05-21,"You may be afraid that someone in your life might become more of a problem during the days ahead. Although nipping a challenging situation in the bud sounds like a smart plan, it's not always wise to suppress the natural expression of negative emotions like fear and anger. If you truly want to handle the situation in a way that preempts potential trouble, ask thoughtful questions and be an active listener. It's easier to deal with things once they are out in the open."
aries,2011-05-22,"You are inspired to put your finances in order today, but it may be challenging to actually follow through on your intentions. Handling money matters requires singular concentration, yet your vivid imagination can interfere with your ability to stay focused. Nevertheless, your fiscal stability is a worthwhile goal, so every time you wander off in your thoughts, just bring yourself back to the job at hand."
taurus,2011-05-22,"Your key planet Venus is squared by the rational Aquarius Moon, emphasizing the conflict between what you want and what you truly need. You are eager to share your thoughts with someone you trust while talkative Mercury is in your sign. You might think that you're being perfectly clear now, but your actions don't seem to support your words. It may be a better strategy to work diligently toward reaching satisfaction without saying too much for a day or two."
gemini,2011-05-22,"Mercury the Messenger is revving up your brain and activating your 12th House of Secrets. You have a lot to say, but aren't sure how to work your thoughts into a conversation. You don't necessarily want to be left alone today now that the Sun is in your 1st House of Self, but a miscommunication or a misunderstanding might disrupt your social plans. The good news is that it's easier to stay on your path if you have fewer distractions."
cancer,2011-05-22,"You are lulled into a surreal mental space but the emotionally detached Aquarius Moon is visiting your 8th House of Transformation, encouraging you to use your intellect to interpret the mysterious symbols of your dreams. Unfortunately, this may be a dead end strategy because rational analysis won't uncover any hidden meaning. Instead, follow your imagination and you'll remember what your subconscious mind is trying to tell you when you least expect it."
leo,2011-05-22,"The conceptual Aquarius Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners could attract a very intelligent person into your life who believes that he or she has the answers you seek. But you don't want to be distracted by anyone because you're trying to figure out how you will get through the time crunch that you now face. Ultimately, you can create unnecessary frustration by concentrating on what's ahead before you handle a more immediate situation first."
virgo,2011-05-22,"Your unrestrained idealism might tempt you to set your sights too high today. Thankfully, your approach is methodical and you can prioritize all the chores that you want to finish. But you may have to let some of your pet projects fall to the wayside. Being selective and eliminating non-essential chores should help you feel less anxious, especially if you preemptively handle a potential problem, rather than waiting for it to turn into a minor disaster."
libra,2011-05-22,"Your key planet Venus has been cavorting with noisy Mercury and pushy Mars, replacing sweet romance with tough talk. Fortunately, you can reclaim your sensuality now by shifting the focus to nebulous Neptune. Let go of your personal tastes and specific desires by detaching yourself from what may happen. Don't waste time by letting others know what you want. Instead, surrender to the flow; you can always check your GPS tomorrow and then decide where to go next."
scorpio,2011-05-22,"The Sun's entry into your 8th House of Deep Sharing reminds you that dancing around surface issues isn't all that fulfilling. You want to build meaningful relationships with close friends or family. However, your desires may be thwarted by someone who has a very different agenda. Don't try to talk the other person into seeing things your way; the more you interact today, the further apart you grow, so avoid lengthy explanations at all costs."
sagittarius,2011-05-22,"You might think you have a very practical strategy to finish your long list of chores today, but your idealistic solutions may fall apart once you start executing your plans. You could underestimate how much time a job could take, or maybe you discover that you're missing an important tool. Either way, working faster isn't the answer. Ironically, you'll finish sooner if you slow down. Doing a job right the first time is more efficient than having to do it again."
capricorn,2011-05-22,"You can grow anxious when you misinterpret what's happening in your life today, especially if your lack of clarity has to do with financial matters. The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Self-Worth puts money on your mind, and a dreamy Sun-Neptune square can inflate your expectations and set you up for disappointment. Avoid discouragement by remaining realistic about your resources and staying aware of the time and money that will be necessary to make a creative idea worthwhile."
aquarius,2011-05-22,"Today you seem to be attracted to anything that allows you to lose yourself in a crowd of people or get caught up in a group cause. But you won't be able to run away from yourself because you'll probably bump into someone you know just when you thought you escaped. Rather than trying to sidestep a difficult emotional interaction, just stay present with your feelings. You might be pleasantly surprised by what happens when you show up with your heart and not just your head."
pisces,2011-05-22,"The Sun's square to your key planet Neptune can act like a green light that's inviting you to luxuriate in the rich symbolism of your imagination. Fortunately, you're not a stranger to slipping behind the veil of consciousness. However, it's challenging now to put your dreams to work. Today is your day of rest; instead of actively planning your next move, just let your mind wander without any specific agenda."
aries,2011-05-23,"You may think you know what's happening today, but you could still miss the boat. Fortunately, your friends might be able to help you see the truth. It's not that they know more than you; it's just that they want what's best for you and will tell you what they honestly think. Holding on to your current plans might seem like the smartest thing to do, but remember that you may have made up your mind even before you had all the facts."
taurus,2011-05-23,"You might still feel a bit spacey today if you're unable to shake off yesterday's mood. Although this confusion can be challenging if you have a decision to make, you probably know exactly what you want. The problem is that you don't know the shortest route to your destination. You aren't happy if you can't read the signals, but get over your discomfort; your path will become clear if you stay focused on your goal."
gemini,2011-05-23,"It's difficult to make any sense out of the data you have today because logical Mercury remains frustrated by stern Saturn's demands for more facts. No matter how objective you think you are now, your analysis is still colored by your opinion. You may be very careful with your words, but you still come up short delivering your message. Don't give up; keep searching for the missing pieces of the puzzle. They will eventually fall into place, but not without patience and extra effort on your part."
cancer,2011-05-23,"The conceptual Aquarius Moon may leave you feeling a bit detached from your emotions. You might be nostalgic, even if your past wasn't actually as sweet as you now remember it. If you're struggling for a simple route home and need some reference points, it's perfectly natural to look back. Just keep in mind that these recollections are biased, so don't make any serious decisions based upon them. Wait until you fully return to the present prior to giving your final answer."
leo,2011-05-23,"Although you might have a project in mind, a friend or an associate could open your eyes to a new alternative today. Proceed with caution because the opportunity may not be as good as it seems and you might not be considering all the facts. You can analyze what can go wrong without dwelling on the negative. There's no reason to be overly pessimistic; just add a healthy dose of reality to any plans you make at this time."
virgo,2011-05-23,"You could underestimate the amount of time it should take to do a particular job today. However, your ability to single-mindedly focus on your goal enables you to compensate for any errors in judgment. Unfortunately, you still may not complete everything you promised, but your honest explanation should be enough for others to understand. Tell the truth, but don't turn it into an excuse. Continue working hard and others will soon recognize the quality of your work."
libra,2011-05-23,"You're ready for the workweek because you believe that collaborating with others will be fun and productive. But looking ahead too far can distract you from something that's right in front of your nose today. Remember, you must take a proactive role in achieving your goals, even if you have to make adjustments to your plan along the way. Don't worry about someone who thinks you should wait; if your intuition says do it now, then go ahead and listen."
scorpio,2011-05-23,"If you think that you're not being appreciated now, you may go out of your way to let others know exactly how you feel about the situation. Although expressing yourself is a wise move, it can also complicate your life. You aren't likely to retreat from complexity, especially if it's directly in the path of your truth. Fortunately, the Venus-Mars conjunction in your 7th House of Relationships indicates that your willingness to take a risk in the name of integrity today should pay off."
sagittarius,2011-05-23,"You can visualize your ideal situation in your mind's eye and may be certain that this is exactly how things will unfold. But your friends and associates aren't as sure of your current optimism, which appears unwarranted to them. Nevertheless, you cannot see anything wrong with your line of thought. Fortunately, you might not be as far off base as others think, but accepting a reality check from someone you trust is rarely a bad move."
capricorn,2011-05-23,"You are quite concerned with doing the right thing now because you have your heart set on an objective and don't want to waste any time. Although your intentions are serious, you cannot completely suppress your inner child that wants to come out and play today. It's wonderful if you can carve out some space to have fun; just don't get greedy and take too much. Find satisfaction in the little things and then return to your larger ambitions."
aquarius,2011-05-23,"Your life might get a little strange today and your emotional reactions could surprise you. You are usually somewhat moodier when the Moon is back in your own sign, but unexpected twists and turns are even more prevalent now that the Sun is moving toward a sextile with erratic Uranus. There's nothing you must do but remain flexible; whatever happens is probably synchronized with mysterious forces that may forge a new direction in your life."
pisces,2011-05-23,"The Moon's visit to your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery may bring you assistance from unseen quarters today. You seem to intuitively know which way to go and pieces just effortlessly fall into place. But trusting a spirit guide, a guardian angel or the luck of the draw won't be enough. You must also pay attention to the facts and balance your instincts with your perceptions of the real world. Nevertheless, don't say no to an opportunity just because you're afraid of the unknown."
aries,2011-05-24,"You may be content with your dreams now, but you're also aware that there is more to life than your fantasies with so many incomplete projects demanding your attention. Even if you're able to postpone a deadline for another day or two, you can't escape thinking about everything you have yet to finish. But worrying in advance doesn't accomplish anything unless you're ready to do something about it now. Don't put off for tomorrow what you can do today."
taurus,2011-05-24,"Your reliability can earn the respect of your associates, especially if you're willing to make a decision today and stand by it. Even if your ideas are unpopular, your serious demeanor convinces others to go along with your choice because they realize how much thought has gone into your response. Nevertheless, picking one side over another is still tricky business, so give yourself permission to change your mind if you are so inclined."
gemini,2011-05-24,"You cannot easily settle down because you're thinking about the possible repercussions to what you're doing. Your previously optimistic outlook may be sagging because a special opportunity isn't looking quite as good now. Intuitively, you know that once you make up your mind you won't be able to go back and undo your decision, so take all the time you need before announcing your final choice."
cancer,2011-05-24,"You may be having a difficult time today, but others probably won't be aware of your stress because you're able to keep it to yourself. You have a very particular idea of what you want your future to look like, yet you might be convinced that you're not on the right track. Don't try to talk yourself out of your dreams, even if they make your life more complicated now. Your self-doubt will eventually fade and you'll realize that nearly anything is possible once you put your mind to it."
leo,2011-05-24,"You have a unique point of view today, which increases your chances of surprising others, especially if they want to conveniently place you inside a traditional box. Ironically, your perspective isn't quite as radical as it seems; it's just that you may overstate your position as you try to make your case. Although you are quite opinionated, you should be able to get the support you need now as long as you mix integrity into your passions."
virgo,2011-05-24,"You might have an inaccurate view of your partner or co-worker today and yet you're able to logically justify your opinion. Fortunately, you have an open mind and are willing to shift your perspective as you learn more about what's actually happening. Although you're tempted to scatter your energies now, you can achieve better results if you address the tension in a troublesome relationship. Resolving interpersonal dynamics can help you find the time to reach your other goals, too."
libra,2011-05-24,"Instead of concentrating on your tasks at work today, you might be inclined to kick back and enjoy yourself. But you may have to fulfill your responsibilities first, so don't take on any more than what you must. Your wisest strategy now is to balance work with play, rather than declaring either of them as more important than the other."
scorpio,2011-05-24,"It's odd to think that the Moon's entry into imaginative Pisces can bring you back to reality, but her square to the Sun in your 8th House of Transformation today actually does have that effect. The dreaminess further fades with a down-to-earth Venus-Saturn aspect, exposing the limitations of your current perspective. But don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, for your inner child can teach you an important lesson if you let it come out to play."
sagittarius,2011-05-24,"Although you might need to go to work, you probably would prefer disappearing within your own home today. Nevertheless, once you do what is required, you could go back to the seclusion of your residence, turn off the phone and declare temporary independence from the outside world. For someone who normally likes to be the life of the party, hiding out now can be your secret guilty pleasure."
capricorn,2011-05-24,"You don't know what to do as the Moon joins indecisive Neptune in your 3rd House of Information. Although you're able to say the right things that inspire others, you still might see yourself as a fraud because judgmental Saturn prevents you from perceiving yourself clearly today. Keep in mind that your uplifting words can be even more effective now if you believe in them yourself."
aquarius,2011-05-24,"You are full of hope today as the Moon joins idealistic Neptune. But you may also be fearful that your meager efforts might not be enough to make things better. Don't waste precious time belittling your contribution. Instead, shift the energy and focus on what you can do. Global change will not be the result of extraordinary work by a few people; it will come from the combined smaller deeds of everyone."
pisces,2011-05-24,"The Moon's conjunction with spiritual Neptune in your sign today highlights your unique connection to all of humanity and the entire cosmos. You are unable to fully separate yourself from the larger picture, yet, paradoxically, an awkward Venus-Saturn aspect increases your current sense of isolation. Fortunately, taking a bit of time out of your busy day to meditate or pray can be enough to remind you that all fish live in the same sea and that individuality isn't as important as it seems."
aries,2011-05-25,"Your planetary ruler Mars prompts you to initiate action without considering the consequences, while taskmaster Saturn enforces a very different set of rules today. You must justify every single thing you set out to do now or circumstances could prevent you from accomplishing your goals. Unfortunately, even with a well-conceived strategy, it's still not easy to get much done. Paradoxically, it's counterproductive to push so hard, so ease up and take cues from those around you."
taurus,2011-05-25,"Subconscious drives increase your desire to act decisively today, but common sense tells you to use self-restraint in all that you do. It's difficult to find the right amount of force as you attempt to make your dreams come true, yet turning them into reality can be very rewarding. Avoiding unseen problems is easier if you just make time to analyze your options before doing something you might regret."
gemini,2011-05-25,"You may be confused because it seems as if everyone thinks you should be handling things differently. However, none of their ideas feel exactly right to you. Don't question your own judgment today; others might not be able to see your truth. Self-doubt is unproductive; go ahead and trust your intuition now, even if it is contrary to the well-intended advice you receive."
cancer,2011-05-25,"Your confidence is high as you imagine what you will be doing later in the day, but your actual actions may be thwarted by circumstances beyond your control. Unfortunately, you might have already made bold commitments that you don't want to break, leaving you little time to achieve your objectives. Although your optimism will probably wane, it doesn't make sense to play the role of a victim. Stand your ground; do as much as you possibly can today and save the rest for tomorrow."
leo,2011-05-25,"The spontaneous Sun-Uranus sextile tempts you to skip out on your obligations, but avoiding your responsibilities now is not a smart move. Instead of following a whim today, it makes a lot more sense to cool your heels and resign yourself to delaying the fun until you have completed your objectives for the day. But if you meet too much resistance, try backing off just a little bit. Pushing against an immovable obstacle won't be productive and could even tire you out."
virgo,2011-05-25,"You have a real action plan today and you're eager to get started. But someone may not be as supportive as you wish, making success an uphill battle. It might even seem as if others are purposefully working to sabotage your efforts, but it's not helpful to get sidetracked by this kind of drama. Instead of worrying about anyone else now, just show up and do the best you can. If your strategy makes sense, your determination will gradually overcome the resistance."
libra,2011-05-25,"You may feel as if every step you take is being blocked today, but your attitude might just be the result of your frustration. If you are unhappy about what you are currently doing, suppressing your disappointment is not healthy. Avoiding your feelings can trick your psyche into unconsciously seeking out the negativity that you have pushed into the shadows. Rather than struggling to get your message across, consider what you need to learn before trying again."
scorpio,2011-05-25,"If you are annoyed with someone's obstinacy today, go ahead and bring your feelings out into the open. If you don't, a small irritation could begin to fester and become a serious problem. However, caution is also advised if you decide to reveal your current frustration because you may make matters worse if you blame a friend or associate for your dilemma. Minimize your anxiety and relieve the tension by sharing your inner process without judging anyone else."
sagittarius,2011-05-25,"Your impatience could create tension if you demand too much from someone today. You might even try to control things by exercising more authority. Unfortunately, this ineffective management style could create problems. It is wiser to be honest and express your vulnerability by letting others know about your areas of concern. However, it's not useful to expect them to fix your problems, but a healthy exchange of ideas can reveal something important you didn't know."
capricorn,2011-05-25,"Your methodical approach to work may not be as effective as you wish today, and this could annoy you so much that you grow angry. It takes a lot to knock you off track, yet now the little things pile up until they seem like a crisis. It's more important to build a stable foundation on which to stand than trying to reach your goals overnight. Don't get distracted by your fear of failure; instead, just pay attention to the ground beneath your feet and the task right in front of you."
aquarius,2011-05-25,"Someone may be making demands that require you to adjust your calendar today, but all your efforts seem to be for naught. Once the fabric of your day begins to unravel, nothing you do seems to put it all back together again. You could consume a lot of energy trying to reestablish your sense of order, but it's probably smarter to let the house of cards fall. Once the dust has settled you'll be able to recreate your schedule better than ever."
pisces,2011-05-25,"It's unnerving if a good friend becomes overly critical today. Although you are rightfully upset by this apparent betrayal, it's likely that you're expecting too much. Rather than stubbornly holding on to your previous assumptions, relax your grip on the situation by temporarily releasing your attachment to your goals. Ironically, as you let go, others may begin to show the encouragement that they were previously withholding."
aries,2011-05-26,"You may feel a bit anxious today because you know something significant is going to happen, yet you don't know what it is. You might actually be in between two events and already anticipating the next one before you even process your most recent experience. Instead of rushing into the future, allow yourself the luxury of floating now without feeling guilty because you're not doing enough."
taurus,2011-05-26,"You may be a bit worried about money today, yet it's hard to tell whether your fears are based on a difficult memory or on what's happening now. Either way, it's wise to try to separate real concerns from imagined ones. Instead of keeping everything to yourself, share your thoughts with a trusted friend, but don't pretend that you have all the answers. A heartfelt discussion can help you put things in proper perspective."
gemini,2011-05-26,"You wish that you could know what everyone at work is thinking now, but your own thoughts may be so noisy that you can't get past them. It's hard enough if you are distracted by your daydreams when there's a lot to be done in the real world, but it gets even more complicated when you talk yourself into believing irrational fears. Remember, your current perceptions may be colored by a hurtful memory, so don't take yourself too seriously today."
cancer,2011-05-26,"On one hand, you're quite sure that you know where you're going and how you can get there. On the other hand, you might be suspicious that you are missing something important and are afraid of becoming a victim of your own overconfidence. In reality, your smartest strategy is to take the middle road. Positive thinking can be very helpful if you don't push it to an extreme."
leo,2011-05-26,"You may feel some resistance from your friends when you share your plans with them today. Or, you might experience a lack of support from your workmates. Either way, consider that you may have lower self-confidence than usual, which could be a contributing factor to the current situation. Try to postpone any major decisions that affect your long-term relationships until your self-esteem returns to normal."
virgo,2011-05-26,"It's hard to know what you should do today because useful information seems elusive. It's usually easy for you to discern real facts from fabricated opinions through your skillful analysis. However, the fine line between objective data and subjective propaganda is obscured by someone who has an agenda that may be different from yours. Doing extra research now is an intelligent strategy that can save you from an embarrassing situation."
libra,2011-05-26,"You can turn a difficult situation into a beautiful scenario today as attractive Venus aligns with imaginative Neptune. Although this cosmic connection heightens your creativity, it also makes your daily routine more challenging. Pursuing artistic endeavors now is an ideal application of this magical energy, but you may be discouraged when you're pulled back into your mundane workday existence. However, acknowledging the difference between these two realms will help you to move between them as necessary."
scorpio,2011-05-26,"You may not be very accepting of the lack of structure in your life today because you don't have a simple way of measuring your current progress. Unfortunately, your frustration grows when others give you feedback that seems to be based more upon their subjective biases than on current reality. Letting go of control isn't usually easy for you, but now it could turn an awkward situation into a well-earned break."
sagittarius,2011-05-26,"You may feel let down by a workmate today, but your disappointment might actually stem from unrealistic expectations. Although someone might truly flake on you now, it normally wouldn't bother you so much. Your obsessive need for stability at work can tempt you to lean on others for more support than they can possibly give to you. Acknowledging that they may not share your agenda allows you to minimize your harsh judgment, making it easier on everyone involved."
capricorn,2011-05-26,"It's tricky for you to balance your need to be creative today with your more practical side. Fortunately, setting sensible goals early in the day enables you to have confidence about reaching them and relieves you of unnecessary stress. Once you feel more relaxed you will be able to let your imagination guide your work instead of fearfully measuring your production moment by moment."
aquarius,2011-05-26,"You may not feel very social today, even though you must interact with others in order to get your work done. However, it's not necessary to waste your time on frivolous conversations. You don't have to reveal your feelings unless you trust the other person enough to want to share what's on your mind. Keeping your emotions to yourself on the job is your personal choice and need not affect your performance in any way."
pisces,2011-05-26,"You are in your watery element today as long as no one pressures you to make a hasty decision. It's easy for you to float along in your dreams while also doing what's required in the real world. However, you're not yet ready to let go of your fantasies. Simply inform others that you will give them your answer tomorrow when your clarity returns."
aries,2011-05-27,"You have a short temper today with the Moon in reactionary Aries, and your shoot-from-the-hip delivery could turn a sticky situation into a real problem. Fortunately, a little common sense will go a long way to prevent a meltdown over a misunderstanding that won't matter much in the long run. If you get caught up in the heat of the moment and have to express your feelings, at least minimize the potential damage by accepting responsibility for your role in the current situation."
taurus,2011-05-27,"Although you may be required to work with someone whose long-term goals are not the same as yours, at least try to see things from an open-minded perspective. Rather than letting your frustration explode in an unpleasant interaction now, take the high road by acknowledging that your differences don't have to impact your cooperation in a negative way. You can still be true to yourself today while putting patience ahead of insecurity."
gemini,2011-05-27,"An ongoing imbalance of power could rear its ugly head today. You might feel as if others are secretly working against you, yet no one comes out and says anything directly. Your best response to this uncomfortable situation is to remain as optimistic as you can, even if you grow more irritated throughout the day. Relying on your natural flexibility and sidestepping the conversations you want to avoid now should ultimately work in your favor."
cancer,2011-05-27,"Expressing negativity isn't always appropriate, yet showing your anger today could be a sign of strength. Sometimes your first impulse is to emotionally withdraw, leading to a passive-aggressive reaction. However, your stress can quickly push you to the edge now, provoking you to lose control if you aren't aware of your own inner process. Denying your feelings only frustrates you faster, so share your concerns without getting hooked by your attachment to what other people think."
leo,2011-05-27,"Although you may not like what's happening today, you probably don't believe that the current problem is really yours. Nevertheless, from a cosmic perspective, everyone is performing a role in your personal drama and it's annoying if the actors in your script are working against your efforts. Even if others seem disgruntled, keep bringing your focus back to your feelings. Ironically enough, once you take responsibility for your part, the erratic energy should begin to settle down."
virgo,2011-05-27,"A stressed-out workmate may not act nicely toward you today, yet it's still wise to discuss what's going on, rather than avoiding confrontation. But there's no need to force the issue because the truth will come to the surface now with or without your intervention. But if you decide to push things along by talking about someone's irritating behavior, be direct and get right to the point. Properly considered words can effectively act as healing agents if delivered with good intentions and kindness."
libra,2011-05-27,"Others are hard to read today. You may go out of your way to be nice to someone, but your amicable behavior seems to increase your frustration and your uncertainty. The friendlier you are, the worse you feel now. Trust your instincts, even if you don't have the facts to support them. But don't start a fight without a real opponent; shadowboxing won't lead to a solution and will only tired you out. Wait until you have more information before confronting anyone with the truth."
scorpio,2011-05-27,"You may want to do your job in a new and different way today, but the dynamics seem more complicated because something or someone is blocking your path. Powerful emotions are lurking just under the surface and you're concerned that they could sidetrack your day. Although you might get drawn into a conflict if you're not careful, you would be wiser to keep your nose clean for now. Wait until the intensity settles down before shaking up the status quo."
sagittarius,2011-05-27,"All would be fine today, but someone may not be playing according to your rules. It feels as if a raincloud is moving in on your big game, even though it's still sunny. Don't let fear dampen your enthusiasm. Instead of trying to outrun bad weather, head off developing problems by facing negativity directly. Avoiding blame now will have a positive impact on the final outcome."
capricorn,2011-05-27,"The feisty Aries Moon battles with unrelenting Pluto, raising concerns about how your personal story is unfolding and who controls your destiny. Your strong resolve can block out some of the tension, but purposefully remaining unaware of it only deepens the problem. It's counterproductive to avoid conflict today, so bring any differences out into the open. Confrontation may be inevitable now, but healthy compromise offers a lasting solution to the current stress."
aquarius,2011-05-27,"Your life is a bit hectic today and things could fall apart unless you pay close attention to your immediate environment. You prefer to play your cards when you're ready, but may be forced to play them according to someone else's strategy. Don't panic; it may be smarter to walk away from the table and return to the game after you have collected your thoughts. Your strategy will improve when your feelings are not being pulled all over the place."
pisces,2011-05-27,"Being caught up in a wave of social activism may not help your personal life, but it can still be a good thing. If your compassion leads you to spending time with people who think like you, go ahead and ride the surge while it lasts. However, this might be a short-lived passion for you, even if it's a lifelong commitment for others. Don't resist your feelings, your current journey can teach you something important about your place in the world."
aries,2011-05-28,"You must be on guard against your tendency to respond too quickly when interacting with others today. Someone might mistake your intensity for anger, or it's possible that you're really mad and don't even realize it. Either way, it's healthy to take a few relaxing breaths to check in with your emotions before losing your temper and dumping unresolved feelings onto those closest to you."
taurus,2011-05-28,"You may have a very vivid dream that doesn't make any sense to you, no matter how you try to interpret it. Oddly enough, you could be reminded of the nonsensical images when something happens during the day to bring the entire fantasy back to consciousness. There's no need to force rational meaning onto a mysterious message from your unconscious. Simply remembering dreams is sufficient for them to work their magic."
gemini,2011-05-28,"It's challenging to know how hard to push now because others may take offense with your insistence. But your actions come in bursts today; you're enthusiastic one moment and then feeling spaced out the next. Nevertheless, your uneven energetic flow will likely be confusing to others, so take the time to explain yourself instead of talking in clever riddles that leave too much room for misinterpretation."
cancer,2011-05-28,"Your friends and family may think that you are being too much of a mother hen who smothers them with love today. But you know what needs to be done and are quickly irritated when no one else seems to have a clue. Even if you're eager to jump in and fix what's wrong, it's smart to see if anyone even wants your help. If you feel compelled to assist, your deeds will probably be perceived as meddling. However, if you come from a place of love, your simple presence can be a healing force."
leo,2011-05-28,"You may need to handle an unresolved relationship issue today. Your friends might think that you have been exerting too much control, but you don't see it that way at all. Instead of allowing yourself to become irritated because others don't really understand you, take this as an opportunity to show your true colors. Just keep in mind that being more flexible will help you overcome your petty annoyances and enable others to see the real you."
virgo,2011-05-28,"You have a certain idea about how your day should go and you want to put things back on track when it begins to deviate from your plan. You would like to show a more easygoing side of yourself today, but it's challenging to let go of control when you believe that you are holding it all together. Unfortunately, your priorities may be bent out of shape. Consider this situation as an opportunity to develop trust. Sure, you could engineer more perfection into your world now, but the cost may be higher than you realize."
libra,2011-05-28,"You would prefer it if your friends were more cooperative today, but instead they seem to be acting contrary to your wishes just to agitate you. However, they actually just want to do as they wish and be free of judgment. Examine your unspoken expectations before criticizing someone else. You may be wiser now to dig into your shadow and look at your own motives before coming down hard on others."
scorpio,2011-05-28,"The Moon in hotheaded Aries suggests that you might have to lose your temper today to establish an important boundary. Unfortunately, it may be impossible to know how you're doing because your subjectivity allows you to see things the way you want them to be, rather than how they actually are. Nevertheless, trusting your intuition is a good idea now as long as you don't let fear overrule love."
sagittarius,2011-05-28,"You are often inspired by hope, but today it's more important to let practicality be your guide, because the present moment is more significant than any future possibility. Still, your dreams don't need to be shelved; they just have to be relocated into the here and now. Focusing on your immediate concerns is your best strategy to keep your life from growing even more complicated."
capricorn,2011-05-28,"You may believe that you don't have to follow every rule to the letter today since it feels as if you are responsible to a higher spiritual authority. Be careful, for this is a tricky rationalization and you don't have cosmic permission to be destructive or reckless. You can, however, be imaginative and original. Just remember that intelligence is wasted unless you're also acting with compassion. It's more important to be caring than to be clever."
aquarius,2011-05-28,"You have been zapped recently by Uranus the Awakener and it's time to finish your joyride and ease yourself back to reality. However, there's no need to worry if you don't have anything to show from your exciting little junket; your altered perspective is enough. But even if you think you know the truth now, remember that things are still in flux. Although the pace of your life is slower today, stay flexible and remain open to change."
pisces,2011-05-28,"It's difficult to make choices today because your reality is littered with ideas that have leaked through from your imagination. Unfortunately, you might be challenged to distinguish fact from fiction. Fortunately, the overflow from your dreams can make your life more interesting. Don't try to establish the truth yet; just enjoy the show and wait until tomorrow to decipher the meaning of it all."
aries,2011-05-29,You're conflicted today as you sense the shift of energy and the intensity begins to fade. You're simultaneously happy and sad to feel this pause in all the action. Be smart and take advantage of the peace and quiet by doing something mellow to recharge your batteries. Your refreshed vitality will be needed once the pace picks up again in a few days.
taurus,2011-05-29,"Instead of expending your energy doing a variety of tasks, delay some of your chores for another time. Today is your day to relax and simply contemplate your life. Others may think you're just being lazy, but that's because they don't appreciate how you process information. You need time to integrate recent experiences, so give yourself permission to enjoy yourself instead of running around in circles."
gemini,2011-05-29,"You may be quite insistent these days because you are driven by Mercury, Venus and Mars all visiting your 12th House of Destiny. You are often very adaptable, but now you can grow quite stubborn, especially if your goals are within reach. You're not willing to step out of conflict's way just to make your day easier. Stand up for yourself by directly facing anyone who threatens your progress. Remember, you can always demonstrate your flexibility at another time."
cancer,2011-05-29,"You want to hang out with some of your friends or members of your family today, but have no actual agenda other than talking about your dreams and what you want to do in your life. Keep in mind that expressing your visions of the future isn't just about taking a flight of fancy. To the contrary, let yourself feel the down-to-earth pull from the practical Taurus planets by establishing clear priorities and then sticking to your action plan."
leo,2011-05-29,"You may be at odds with yourself today; on one hand, you're annoyed that your spontaneity is being constrained by previous obligations, affording you less wiggle room than you prefer. And yet you know exactly what you have to do now, even if you're tempted to avoid your responsibilities. However, being practical is your best course of action at this time. Don't worry; you'll have more opportunity to play later on in the week."
virgo,2011-05-29,"You have big plans and want to get a lot accomplished today. You're thrilled because you are finally able to work at your own pace and sustain your efforts on your own power. But don't listen to those who try to get you to work faster; you will naturally make choices that increase your productivity in the long run. If necessary, put your foot down before shifting your plans to accommodate someone else. Save the negotiating for another day."
libra,2011-05-29,"A casual relationship will likely become more intense now as the Moon enters your 8th House of Deep Sharing and your feelings become fixed. You're not interested in getting involved in some new age group process; you'd rather do it on your own. Nevertheless, you'll gain a healthier perspective if you can find one trustworthy person to confide in. But don't be too impatient today, for there are no immediate shortcuts on the road to mutual understanding."
scorpio,2011-05-29,"Someone who is thinking too much can get on your nerves today, since you don't understand why anyone would choose to make life more complex than it already is. You would prefer not to interfere, but you also want to wake them up from their little misunderstanding. Although it may appear that this is another person's problem, it's really yours, too. Nevertheless, this might be one of those times when you need to accept responsibility for your own feelings and then just let go of control."
sagittarius,2011-05-29,"Four planets in your 6th House of Minor Annoyances could bog you down in unnecessary details while you'd prefer to focus on the big picture. Still, you may be faced with the very real necessity of living simply and getting back to basics today. Do what you can to carve out your quiet path in an exciting and noisy day. Find a healthy balance between your adventurous spirit and your single-minded ambition."
capricorn,2011-05-29,"If you attended to your work when you should have, now you get to play. Other people may be jealous when you get to relax, for they still have unfinished chores that are infringing upon their time for fun. Nevertheless, you aren't perfect, and today's pressure could highlight something else you should have already completed. Do what you must but don't take on too much; it's far better to enjoy yourself as long as you can."
aquarius,2011-05-29,"You have work to do around the home today, but you may not be eager to start. Obviously, you realize that procrastination delays everything else you want to do, too. Lean on your own convictions; overcome your inertia and fulfill your responsibilities. Do your household chores now instead of putting them off until later. It may not be easy to initiate action, but you'll feel more confident once you get going."
pisces,2011-05-29,"If you have specific plans for the week ahead, you won't want to stop and change them once you are already in motion. Although your determination tends to work in your favor by helping you to be more effective, it can also add to your stress if circumstances change. Your insistence on maintaining the status quo could be your downfall today. A little flexibility on your part can ease a difficult situation if you are stuck. Don't miss the chance to be a hero now."
aries,2011-05-30,"Instead of aimlessly waiting to see where your day goes, create a basic plan upon rising today. It won't be difficult to balance your social activities with a few nagging chores as long as you keep your to-do list very short. Something fun may come up but you might need to say no if you haven't managed your time well. Thankfully, you can circumvent this all-too-familiar routine by simplifying your day and fulfilling your commitments early on."
taurus,2011-05-30,"You can turn this into a very relaxing day, even if you have several things you need to accomplish. The Moon's conjunction with sweet Venus in sensible Taurus helps you maintain a positive attitude, even while circumstances test you. Not much can deter you now, for you're able to take everything in stride. Your mission today is simple: enjoy yourself as much as you can."
gemini,2011-05-30,"The cluster of planets in your 12th House of the Unknown indicates that someone might be hiding the truth from you -- or, at least, that's what you believe. Your mind latches on to a mystery now, leading you to conclude that others are withholding important information. Although your suspicions are largely unfounded, a miscommunication can still send you on a strange detour. Thankfully, untangling the puzzle will be easy enough with a bit of concentration."
cancer,2011-05-30,"It's not about the quantity of your closest comrades; it's the quality of the relationships that sets you apart now. Fortunately, your social life should be pretty stable now with the nurturing Moon in your 11th House of Community. It's important for you to feel emotionally secure and it makes you happy to be able to lean on a few very solid friends. Bask in the glow of camaraderie as you spend special time with those who support your dreams."
leo,2011-05-30,"Someone close to you may ask for your help now because you come across as a responsible person who can hold your position with grace when things get tough. But you don't need to have any special answers; just being there is enough. Your contribution is to be a good listener while sorting through the questions. Even if you are uncertain of the best approach, your relentless loyalty can make a world of difference."
virgo,2011-05-30,"You aren't listening to what others want today because you have a specific idea of your perfect day and you're already on your way. However, your partner or friends might not understand your current choices, and things can get complicated if you don't take the time to explain yourself. Keep in mind that your singular focus on your goals might prevent you from seeing the obvious. There's no need to push yourself; slowing down enables you to enjoy the good things in your life right now."
libra,2011-05-30,You might think that you know what needs to be done now to make your partner happier or your friends feel better. But over-personalizing someone else's problems can be frustrating and could make your day less enjoyable. Linking your satisfaction to others is tricky business; it may leave you feeling depleted and won't necessarily help them. Your smartest strategy is to be a sympathetic listener and offer support without attempting to fix anything.
scorpio,2011-05-30,"Four planets in stubborn Taurus are activating your 7th House of Relationships, and no matter how confident you feel today, it's wise to remember that your point of view is only one out of many. It's not that you have drawn an incorrect conclusion; it's just that there are multiple roads leading to an infinite number of destinations. Reality is not as rigid as it currently appears. Be flexible in your thinking now, for new possibilities will appear sooner than you expect."
sagittarius,2011-05-30,"If you want to do something special today, you may become so obsessed with making it happen that you're limited by your goals, rather than inspired by them. However, the current situation could play out much differently. If you remember to use your common sense then you'll be more willing to shift your approach. Altering the direction of your arrow while it's in flight is not only possible -- it could be your smartest move."
capricorn,2011-05-30,"It's time to shatter another Capricorn myth. You may be the best planners in the zodiac, yet you also know how to live in the moment. Although you're no stranger to delaying personal gratification when necessary, the current emphasis on your 5th House of Spontaneity indicates that you're ready to put pleasure ahead of responsibility today. Don't worry about what anyone else is thinking; just experience the joy of this moment as if you've been rehearsing for it your entire life."
aquarius,2011-05-30,"Having a solid home and family life can be a major blessing with the Moon in your 4th House of Roots. However, you also may experience complicated emotions about your obligations that restrain your freedom. Domestic relationships can feel like a double-edged sword as their responsibilities go hand-in-hand with their rewards. Tread carefully and don't make any foolish declarations of independence that result from your frustration, or you may have to eat your words tomorrow."
pisces,2011-05-30,"Your appointment with destiny is on schedule, even if it's not on your calendar today. You might be hesitant to make significant changes in your life now, especially if the major pieces are working. However, you feel a growing pressure from within and realize that sooner or later you will have to acknowledge what's in your heart, even if it messes with the stability of your personal life."
aries,2011-05-31,"You may try to put off the inevitable today, but sooner or later you'll need to make a decision that you don't want to face. You might be tempted to take the easy way out, but it's wiser to think about the consequences of your actions, especially when it comes to choices that affect your finances. A temporary fix can be as problematic as sidestepping the situation, so muster up the courage to overcome your resistance and respond with your complete attention to the matter."
taurus,2011-05-31,"It's easier for you to take care of business when you're not distracted by a lack of solid footing. However, your self-confidence can suffer when things seem to be in flux and you can't see what's around the next corner. And although you don't necessarily know what will happen in the future, at least things seem to be running smoothly now. Just remember that this is no time to get lazy. There are many things you should be doing today, even if you're not under pressure to respond."
gemini,2011-05-31,"You can be extremely productive today, but only if you overcome your feelings of restlessness. Unfortunately, now that the pace of events is slowing down, your thoughts are speeding up -- and they may land you in big trouble if you're looking to stir up some mischief. Think seriously about what you really want, for you might just find more of it than you can handle."
cancer,2011-05-31,"Sometimes you can overcome your insecurity and do whatever makes the most sense. At other times you prefer to take the wait-and-see approach. Today, however, it's difficult to know how to act. You're tempted to be less assertive if you can avoid direct confrontation, but someone might come to the rescue by supporting your efforts. Life is easier when you know that you've got a friend."
leo,2011-05-31,"Although you have a clear sense of what needs to be done at work, everything seems to take longer than you expect. You may have to turn down a friendly invitation or postpone a pleasurable social engagement so you can finish your chores. Don't try to justify any kind of procrastination. Once you get rolling, a seemingly insurmountable task will flow faster than you thought."
virgo,2011-05-31,"This can be a day of solid progress as long as you don't bite off more than you can handle. Obviously, rushing through any job just to get it done invites sloppiness. Working faster encourages you to make mistakes that can haunt you later on. Take your time and do it right, even if everyone else seems to be in a hurry. It's more important to lay a lasting foundation now than to meet someone else's arbitrary deadline."
libra,2011-05-31,"You could grow frustrated today as your boss changes your job before you finish it. Each time you make progress, someone switches the rules once again. You are tempted to give up because you don't want to waste your time doing something that ultimately has no lasting value. However, you probably cannot see the bigger picture; it's better now to analyze things less and simply attend to your work as it is assigned. Everything will make more sense soon enough."
scorpio,2011-05-31,"Establishing a sustainable pace of production feels good now, for you're tired of running around in circles that keep bringing you back to the same place. Today it finally feels as if you are making progress, yet someone may want to slow you down even more. Don't resist; this is a chance to improve the quality of your work by taking a break and replenishing your energy."
sagittarius,2011-05-31,"This may seem like a relatively quiet day, yet you can achieve positive results on several fronts. The cluster of planets in your 6th House of Details enables you to make improvements to your health regimen that will have lasting effects. Additionally, increasing your efficiency on the job by reorganizing your files, catching up on emails or doing routine paperwork is an intelligent use of today's transits. Working steadily is more satisfying now, so make the most of it while you're in the mood."
capricorn,2011-05-31,"Setting your goals early today can help you be even more productive than you thought possible. However, it's not a good idea to expect amazing results to just be dropped into your lap. There are no shortcuts available now and you will have to work extra hard if you want to reap the benefits later on. Thankfully, the Moon is visiting your 5th House of Fun and Games for most of the day, allowing you to have an enjoyable time crossing off the things on your list one at a time."
aquarius,2011-05-31,"You're not afraid of stirring things up if you are ready to make changes in your life. However, you are probably still enjoying the recent stability with so many planets in down-to-earth Taurus. You like the consistent connection that you have with your work and are eagerly anticipating reaping the fruits of your current labor. If things are going well, you may be tempted to take a bit of time off; however it's not wise to start coasting yet. Stay focused on your goals; you'll have plenty of opportunity to relax later on."
pisces,2011-05-31,"It can feel quite demoralizing if someone criticizes you out of the blue; however, a friend's harsh analysis might be very inspiring now. Don't put up unnecessary boundaries; instead, be an active listener and take the feedback you receive to heart. You have an opportunity to improve your communication skills and this could have a positive impact on your relationships with others. Remember, the right guidance can be a blessing, so don't let your pride get in the way."
aries,2011-06-01,"You want to share your feelings, but self-disclosure is a risky business that can make you more vulnerable. Today's Solar Eclipse enlivens your 3rd House of Information, reminding you to gather as much data as you dispense. It's pointless to tell others about your concerns unless you're also willing to listen to what they have to say. Pay close attention to all your interactions now; because you can learn something important even from a casual chat."
taurus,2011-06-01,"If you are worried about your finances, today's New Moon Eclipse in your 2nd House of Money is an excellent time to change your strategy and set yourself back on course. Try not to get caught up in an unnecessary panic; allow yourself enough breathing room to consider what might make you feel more secure. At least, take a few steps that will lead you in the right direction, even if you cannot achieve your fiscal goals immediately."
gemini,2011-06-01,"The Solar Eclipse in your sign today can be a game changer and a reality shifter, yet its trine to resistant Saturn indicates your current desire for security. Unfortunately, trying to keep things as they are now is a study in frustration. Make a list of all the things you want to accomplish, but give yourself permission to review your priorities along the way. Being adaptable is one of your greatest strengths, so if you fall short of your goals, just review your plans and try again."
cancer,2011-06-01,"Your energy may be scattered today, making it difficult to be productive. You won't likely accomplish much that others will notice, for today's Solar Eclipse falls in your 12th House of Secrets. Thankfully, your current mental gymnastics can reveal a totally new direction for you to follow. Don't resist any thoughts that come to you now, even if they seem unrealistic. You will have plenty of time later to weed out the distracting ideas and to nurture the good ones."
leo,2011-06-01,"The New Moon Eclipse activates your 11th House of Networking and steps up the level of activity with your friends and family. Although you were hoping to slow down, unexpected events can draw you out into the community. Your reenergized public life is not a distraction from what you should be doing because social interactions could bring you the support you need. Fortunately, changing your attitude allows you to see the advantages of having allies who believe in you."
virgo,2011-06-01,"Although today's New Moon Eclipse in whimsical Gemini can disperse your energy, it polarizes your 10th House of Status, turning this into a great time to pursue your professional ambitions. However, your ability to concentrate is being tested and you might try to start your new journey by simultaneously heading in several directions. Unfortunately, you must make a decision; fortunately, you'll feel better once you do."
libra,2011-06-01,"You can share your thoughts about going back to school or fantasize out loud about your latest vacation destination, but you must get serious if you actually want to make something happen. It's easier to talk about your plans now than to execute them with the loquacious Gemini Solar Eclipse activating your 9th House of Big Ideas. But don't waste your time telling tales of maybes and possibilities. Instead, pick one goal, write it down and then commit to do whatever it takes to make your dreams come true."
scorpio,2011-06-01,"Today's chatty Gemini Solar Eclipse in your 8th House of Intimacy can provoke you to talk about things that others might choose to avoid. Admittedly, your high threshold for emotional intensity may prove to be challenging for your friends now because you're willing to discuss whatever's on your mind. Nevertheless, tempering your approach prevents others from suddenly bolting to find safer ground, allowing you to have the deep and meaningful discussion that you crave."
sagittarius,2011-06-01,"Today's Solar Eclipse occurs in your 7th House of Partners, polarizing a long-standing disagreement between you and a close friend. Bringing things out into the open may be awkward or even painful at first, but it's a necessary step on your way to healing a rift in a relationship that matters. Don't ramble on aimlessly; make your point and then be quiet. Mercury the Communicator is still in down-to-earth Taurus, so keep your message short and simple."
capricorn,2011-06-01,You may assume that shifting your attitude will be enough to modify your behavior. But changing an old habit that has become part of your regular routine can be more complicated than just thinking differently. Today's Gemini New Moon Eclipse in your 6th House of Self-Improvement indicates that you must take action in the real world to establish a new mental pattern in the physical realms. The little gains you make now will grow into bigger ones over time.
aquarius,2011-06-01,"Although you may have an ambitious agenda, you still want to have fun because today's Gemini Solar Eclipse falls in your 5th House of Play. However, this isn't a valid reason to avoid your responsibilities. The real lesson is that you can accomplish more when you enjoy what you're doing. The choice is yours; you can harbor resentment or you can change your attitude and whistle while you work."
pisces,2011-06-01,"It's not always easy for you to express yourself because words fall short of conveying the complexity of your emotions. Nevertheless, today's New Moon Eclipse in jittery Gemini rattles your 4th House of Security, prompting you to talk about what you need. But don't hide your vulnerability behind vague generalities or nervous laughter; you have a lot to gain if you can be honest about your feelings."
aries,2011-06-02,"Although you might be a bit sleep deprived from all the energy that you have been expending lately, you'll probably still be raring to go today. Mental Mercury enters airy Gemini, fanning your fires and fueling your enthusiasm. Keep in mind that you can push yourself too hard now, so don't overdo it by piling more distractions onto your already busy schedule. If you spread yourself too thin, you'll end up being exhausted by tonight with very little to show for your efforts."
taurus,2011-06-02,"You've been waiting for the right time to express a thought that's been on your mind for a while. Although today may not actually be better than any other day, your frustration could provoke you to start a difficult conversation. However, your friends will lose focus if your words wander aimlessly, so be direct and keep your message short and sweet. Reassure everyone that you're not seeking a quick answer; you just want to be heard and acknowledged."
gemini,2011-06-02,"Yesterday's Gemini Solar Eclipse hit the emotional reset button and today when quicksilver Mercury enters your sign, your sense of starting anew is confirmed. But you may have so many possibilities before you that it's difficult to pick only one. Take some time to think about something in your life that's already served its purpose and then consider what you want to replace it. Concentrating on your current needs now can have a positive impact on your future."
cancer,2011-06-02,"Your thoughts may be running in many directions today, but communicator Mercury's shift into your 12th House of Secrets hides your inner process from others. You are self-contained now and your loved ones might not realize the magnitude of your unsettled emotions. Even if you choose not to express your feelings, be sure to stay conscious of them because avoiding your truth isn't healthy in the long run."
leo,2011-06-02,"Your co-workers may be placing unspoken demands on you today and you aren't sure how to deal with them yet. You think that you're clever enough to work around whatever you don't know, but you may soon realize that logic won't be able to help you regain control of your day. You might attempt to guess the true motives of those around you, but this strategy will only bring frustration. Instead of trying to be the perfect employee, practice emotional detachment to alleviate the current pressure."
virgo,2011-06-02,"You are uncertain how to respond as you try to establish new objectives at work. It's challenging to separate the useful information from everything you're being told today as your key planet Mercury enters noisy Gemini and your 10th House of Career. Thinking about all the possibilities can be a daunting task if you need to make long-term decisions now. Thankfully, you have more time than you realize and should be able to gain more clarity over the next few days."
libra,2011-06-02,"You could have more bounce to your step today, as if a lightness of being has entered your body and activated your cells all the way down to the tips of your toes. However, your head is also affected as the changing clouds move quickly across your mental landscape. Luckily, Mercury shifts into your 9th House of Future Vision, encouraging you to reach further than usual. Give yourself permission to fantasize about what's ahead without worrying about whether or not it's actually possible."
scorpio,2011-06-02,"Mercury's shift into airy Gemini today brings intellectual acuity to your 8th House of Intimate Sharing, reinforcing your need to intensify your emotional interactions. Naturally, digging deep is an important part of being a passionate Scorpio, yet now you can explore the shadows from a more lighthearted and logical perspective. Nevertheless, you must be careful, for you could still be overwhelmed by unconscious desires if you don't monitor what you feel as you go along."
sagittarius,2011-06-02,"Interactive Mercury enters your 7th House of Others, shifting the emphasis onto how you respond in a relationship, rather than what you might choose to do on your own. The focus seems to be on everyone else but you today. Unfortunately, if you attempt to play the lead, things could get complicated quickly. Keep in mind that you can have more fun if you're willing to step out of the spotlight for a while and play a supporting role, instead."
capricorn,2011-06-02,"It's not easy to remain serious today, even if you have critical responsibilities to fulfill. Mercury's entry into flighty Gemini can scatter your thoughts as fast as you refocus them. Every time you concentrate, something exciting comes along to pull you off track and down a curiously fascinating detour. Stop resisting the inevitable; instead of trying to be productive, just let go and see where the intellectual currents take you."
aquarius,2011-06-02,"A plethora of pleasing planetary positions pulls you away from your obligations today. Initially, you may set your goals high, but as the day progresses, the opportunity for play outweighs the potential rewards for hard work. Mercury's shift into your 5th House of Spontaneity indicates that it's wiser now to put aside your previous plans and simply make up new ones as needed."
pisces,2011-06-02,"Although you could be required to go to work today, you may consider staying home anyway. Your friends might think that your current desire for solitude is a sign that something is wrong, but they couldn't be further from the truth. Carving out a bit of time to focus on your home and family is a smart way to get in tune with Mercury's move into your 4th House of Roots. Don't worry about what others say; your inner security counts more than anything else now."
aries,2011-06-03,"Although things appear to be moving forward at first, your vision seems to be obscured today. You're ready for action, but it's hard to tell where you are going now. Even if you intuitively know that it makes sense to cool your jets, your frustration won't likely dissipate until you start making progress. Nevertheless, it will be easier to head off in a new direction once the fog clears next week."
taurus,2011-06-03,"You may be losing patience with people who turn small problems into major crises. But even if you know that some damage control is necessary today, you might not be in a position to do what's required. Rather than pretending you have a sensible plan, ease up on your reins and let events take their own course for now. You will be more effective if you wait until Monday to saddle up and take charge."
gemini,2011-06-03,"You believe that you're clever enough to lead others successfully. You're so good at spinning stories now that you could even convince yourself. However, it's like you're currently walking through a carnival house of mirrors and your perceptions are bent way out of shape. Stepping back and allowing someone else to take control today can save you from additional complications next week."
cancer,2011-06-03,"Although you are sympathetic to other people's feelings, you may try to hide behind a protective shell because the energy is so intense now. The Moon's return to your sign complicates your life because there are so many crosscurrents that you can't tell which way to go. Don't let anyone intimidate you into making a decision prematurely. It's much easier to change your mind before you commit than after you've headed off in the wrong direction."
leo,2011-06-03,"You may be a bit befuddled today because you want to take action, yet the flow of energy is predominately inward. The Moon in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness reflects your current need to escape from the hustle and bustle of the outer world. But a difficult situation pressures you to do something about it now. If it seems like you're riding an emotional rollercoaster, just hold on tightly and wait until your feelings smooth out before letting others know what's on your mind."
virgo,2011-06-03,"Others often come to you for advice when they need a sharp analytical mind to assess their predicaments. However, you're the one that's now seeking a reality check. Unfortunately, you can't rely on anyone else today, for everyone is just as perplexed as you are. Delay any important decisions that you can, for your mental acuity will return next week."
libra,2011-06-03,"It's challenging to settle your nerves today because your current anxiety is coming from several different sources. Unfortunately, isolating individual problems and solving them won't address the overall big picture. Instead of seeking solutions that require practical thinking and specific action, you're better off now to work on improving your attitude. If you can be flexible enough about what is happening, you'll realize that you don't have to waste energy worrying about things you cannot control."
scorpio,2011-06-03,"It may seem as if someone is pushing you into an unwanted leadership role today. You don't want to take charge now because you're not really sure about the future. Nevertheless, everyone is still looking to you for direction. You don't need to pretend that you know more than you actually do. You can still effectively share your current thinking while acknowledging that you don't have all the answers. Meanwhile, don't forget to give yourself permission to feel special because your peers truly believe in you."
sagittarius,2011-06-03,"Your concern over someone's behavior today may present a problem. Your temptation is to share your strong opinion, especially if you believe that your ideas can help others see the truth. But it's not as straightforward as it appears because self-righteousness can lead you astray. The warning signal is thinking that your way is the only way. Keeping an open mind can turn a huge obstacle into a small bump in the road."
capricorn,2011-06-03,"You may be annoyed today about having to deal with associates who won't acknowledge their real motives. You are able to be flexible now if you know the truth, but you don't want to draw your conclusions based upon incomplete data. Unfortunately, misinterpretations are likely because the information just isn't as clear as you want. Stop struggling; your current disorientation will only last for a day or two. In the meantime, cultivate your dreams, instead."
aquarius,2011-06-03,"If someone presents you with a problem today, don't make judgments based upon how you might react in a similar situation. You are wired to be cool and calm, even in a highly charged situation, while others are likely to get caught up in a drama. Be a real friend now and don't be overly critical; simply listen to their stories and offer your shoulder when needed."
pisces,2011-06-03,"You may believe that you're being extremely productive and want others to notice what you're doing. But it's not a good idea to bring too much attention to yourself now because your work isn't necessarily as great as you think it is. Your illusions are flowing freely today, testing your ability to maintain a clear perspective. Your desires are warping your perceptions, so lying low and remaining under the radar may be your smartest strategy at this time."
aries,2011-06-04,"You may be worried by how things are turning out, but you'll be in better shape than you think if you can let go of your inflated expectations. Your recent growth spurt is coming to an end now that opportunistic Jupiter has left your sign. You'll still be able to make changes and even increase your income, but you need to start practicing some self-restraint. Concentrate on delivering what's already been promised, instead of dreaming up a whole new set of schemes."
taurus,2011-06-04,"Jovial Jupiter is back in your sign for the first time in twelve years, already encouraging you to take on more work. But don't say yes before you untangle all the details, because everything can appear easier to do than it actually is. You may not be willing to let go of a project until it meets your standards, provoking you to go back over what you already did. Instead of rapidly plowing through your tasks today, be smart and postpone some chores for another day."
gemini,2011-06-04,"Slowing your pace over the weekend may not sound like a lot of fun, but it might be the smartest thing to do. You will likely have a lot on your plate next week, so it's wise to rest when you have the chance. Your friends might not realize that you are emotionally on edge. But even if your mind is bouncing around all over the place, give your body permission to chill out and take it easy."
cancer,2011-06-04,"There's no need to worry about your changing moods now, because the Moon's visit to your sign can run you through your emotional paces. It's best to try to be an observer and stay unattached to your feelings as they come and go. Just let your thoughts run their own course until they become less charged. Keep in mind that you don't have to share your inner process with anyone yet. Wait until you feel more at peace before trying to explain what's going on."
leo,2011-06-04,"You aren't thrilled about keeping secrets today because being emotionally transparent is your preferred style. However, saying less is probably your most intelligent strategy at this time. All you need to do is share one private feeling and the gates of communication are thrown open. Even if you know what's best, it will be difficult to stop talking midstream. It's much easier to manage your data flow now if you approach it as an all-or-nothing situation."
virgo,2011-06-04,"You can act as if you don't care, but you're probably overly worried about what others think of you today. The passive Cancer Moon is visiting your 11th House of Social Networking, tempting you to withdraw before anyone can reject you. However, your self-protection schemes may be motivated by your fear, rather than someone's negative judgment. Be courageous and remain open to others now, even if you're feeling vulnerable."
libra,2011-06-04,"Your even-keeled logic may have to be swept under a rug now, for your analysis leads you directly to one conclusion while your heart heads in another direction. Although you might convince yourself that you don't have to get involved in other people's business, you're ultimately unable to shut down if a family member or close friend needs help. Once you go through the motions of considering all the reasons to stay out of it, toss them aside and do what feels right to you."
scorpio,2011-06-04,"Your idea of supporting someone you love can be best expressed today through a balance of tender nurturing and cool detachment. Although you may long for an intimate connection, you also need your independence these days. You could even be caught in a conflict between firing up a relationship or cooling down your feelings as you try to manage a commitment conflict. Take the pressure off of the situation for now by avoiding extreme reactions on either side."
sagittarius,2011-06-04,"You would like to take the easy way out of a complex dilemma today by falling back on your skills of procrastination. Naturally, this is neither a permanent fix, nor a very admirable strategy, but avoiding open conflict now could be your smartest course of action. If possible, delay an important decision since much of the current resistance will naturally dissipate on its own. Allow everyone to sleep on it for a couple of days and then try again."
capricorn,2011-06-04,"You have quite a bit of work on your plate for the week ahead, but your inclination is to remain quiet this weekend, rather than actively expressing concerns. You are guardedly optimistic because you realize that you will reach your goals, even though it won't be easy. Rest now and make plans tomorrow; once the obstacles have been cleared you'll be able to get on your way."
aquarius,2011-06-04,"You may feel awkward as you try to find your groove today, for whatever you're doing, it seems as if something is wrong. Fortunately, this subtle discomfort motivates you to take care of lots of smaller tasks that remain unfinished. Instead of complaining about all the work still left undone, transform your negativity into positive action with a little help from your friends."
pisces,2011-06-04,"It's not that there's anything specifically wrong; it's just that you may not have the luxury of speaking your mind in an unedited fashion today. Sharing your worries might send someone you like into an emotional tailspin, intensifying the drama. Instead, be smart and help others feel more at ease with what's happening now. Ultimately, being sensitive is a much wiser approach than telling everyone exactly what you think."
aries,2011-06-05,"Your unsettled feelings might drive you to the edge today, yet the adrenaline rush lets you know that you are alive. Relationship drama weighs heavily on your mind now, but once you express your intentions, you'll feel revitalized. Don't bother trying to figure out what's going on; all you need is a positive attitude as you reinvent your future."
taurus,2011-06-05,"You may be self-critical today as strict Saturn leans on sweet Venus. If you fall short of fulfilling your desires, you will probably believe that it was your own fault, no matter how much effort you put forth. Although you might not receive the approval you want now, recognition could still come later. Don't keep everyone at a distance so you can appear invincible. Others will be more likely to support you if you have the courage to reveal your vulnerability and just be yourself."
gemini,2011-06-05,"Your restlessness may be enjoyable now because your current activity level matches the speed at which your thoughts are unfolding. Although you might actually feel quite productive, you won't likely accomplish as much as you think you will. Ultimately, the choice is yours: fritter your time away doing one trivial thing after another or consciously concentrate on getting the results you want."
cancer,2011-06-05,"You're ready to swing into motion today, but you may not want to do anything too quickly. It's wise to spend the morning in contemplation, going over your ideas and analyzing the possible outcomes to each of your ambitious strategies. However, making careful plans isn't enough to propel you to your desired destination, so use the fiery Leo Moon's confidence to initiate action that will bring tangible results."
leo,2011-06-05,"The Moon's return to your sign today helps you get your intentions out into the open. Even if you've been trying to keep your emotions secret, it may be time to take a risk and share them with others. But you cannot just express every single whim that crosses your mind to whomever you happen to be talking to at the moment. Setting healthy boundaries is crucial now. Your inner life is your business alone, unless you choose to discuss your feelings with someone you trust."
virgo,2011-06-05,"The Moon's shift into your 12th House of Privacy today raises issues, for you're pulled between telling others what you feel and revealing nothing at all. You will probably be happier if you share some of your secrets with a close friend, but it's not wise to ramble on. Stay conscious of your message and stop talking before you diffuse what you need to say."
libra,2011-06-05,"The Moon enters your 11th House of Social Networking today, inviting you to be a more active participant in your group of friends and associates. Your desire to belong to a community motivates you to get involved with others. However, you must draw a firm line to establish your limits now or you'll be dragged into a drama that needn't impact you otherwise. Remember, hold your ground in a way that allows you to still join in the fun."
scorpio,2011-06-05,"You could be expected to do something at work today that requires you to set aside your personal agenda. Even if you're committed to excelling at your job, you don't like it when others assume that you'll say yes, even before you do. Instead of immediately rearranging your previous schedule to jump into a new assignment, take a risk and share your concerns. Once your position is out on the table, you'll be able to negotiate a solution that is comfortable for everyone involved."
sagittarius,2011-06-05,"You may be even more outspoken than normal, stating your opinion on everything and everyone. Others may be confused by your responses because one moment you're uplifting and inspirational, and just a few minutes later you're overly pragmatic and resistant to new ideas. Instead of reacting by saying the first thing that crosses your mind, let everyone know that you need to clarify your conflicting thoughts before you draw any conclusions. No one will fault you for this kind of honesty; a little discretion goes a long way."
capricorn,2011-06-05,"You may be struggling today as you try to decide whether to share your desires with someone you admire. You want your feelings to be acknowledged, but you might be afraid of being rejected. If you go ahead and take a risk, at least reveal your emotions consciously, without expecting any particular response. The smartest way to minimize potential emotional discomfort is to stay unattached from the outcome. The real magic now is found in embarking on the journey, and not arriving at the destination."
aquarius,2011-06-05,"It's all too easy for you to slip back into an old, familiar relationship pattern as the Moon enters your 7th House of Companions. Although the Moon connects you to the past, there's no guarantee that a tried and true method will work today because active Mars is aspecting unruly Uranus. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider the consequences before doing something you might quickly regret."
pisces,2011-06-05,"The Moon's shift into your 6th House of Health today reminds you of the relationship between diet, exercise and your overall well-being. Even if you're already eating organically and practicing yoga, it may be time to make minor improvements to your daily regimen. It's always wise to cultivate more awareness and enhance your lifestyle; even the littlest adjustments now can have significant positive ramifications."
aries,2011-06-06,"You may not get caught up with your work as fast as you wish today, for your mind is preoccupied with pleasure rather than production. It's a smart idea to get the distractions out of your system now, for you have too much to do and won't be able to procrastinate forever. Nevertheless, returning to your unfulfilled obligations with a smile on your face will help you accomplish more in the long run."
taurus,2011-06-06,"You have an opportunity today to finish up lots of little tasks at work and at home, including emailing friends, paying bills and cleaning your office. However, don't be too concerned if you don't make measurable progress by the end of the day, for it may take a while to get ahead. Nevertheless, your optimism now can motivate you to reach your goals as long as you don't try to do everything all at once."
gemini,2011-06-06,"You may be holding on to negative feelings about an unfinished conversation yesterday, but you would be wise to let go and move on. You have other fish to fry now and it's more important to look forward than waste time replaying an interaction that didn't go as smoothly as expected. Planning for new successes throughout the coming week is much more useful than worrying about the past."
cancer,2011-06-06,"It's dangerous to make assumptions or jump to conclusions today because once you make up your mind, you're pretty certain that you are correct. Unfortunately, you could be a victim now of believing your own hype. The good news is that your current breadth of vision can fuel amazing discussions on a variety of interesting topics. As fascinating as your conversations might be, specific things that remain unsaid may be even more important than what is stated out loud."
leo,2011-06-06,"You may find it challenging today to handle the consequences of your anger that seems to resurface from time to time, even if you already dealt with the original source of the problem. Thankfully, you can lean on your friends for support now, which may be enough to help you over a rough spot. But don't ask anyone to fix anything; instead, take responsibility by learning from your past mistakes and being flexible enough to adapt to the changing tides."
virgo,2011-06-06,"It's hard for you to relax today because you have so much to do at work. Although you're buzzing all over the place with the Sun and Mercury in your professional 10th house, you probably wish you had a few more days to your weekend because you need more time to think. Nevertheless, your time for contemplation may be over for a while. Just enter the flow of activity and figure it out along the way."
libra,2011-06-06,"It's often challenging for you to make a long-term decision about your plans, especially when there are so many amazing choices. But don't let anyone tell you that you need to decide today, for you would be smarter to keep your options open. There is currently a lot of blue sky around you, making everything appear better than it is. Wait until a few clouds return and see where the shadows are cast before going on record with your final answer."
scorpio,2011-06-06,"Your anger may develop throughout the day if anyone is trying to talk you out of your actual feelings. Uncharacteristically, you might be willing to change your mind today, but only on your own terms. If others don't take the time to find out how you truly feel, then you're probably not going to compromise. However, if they are really interested in your perspective, you can be more open-minded now than they expect."
sagittarius,2011-06-06,"Establishing your priorities can be a real challenge, especially since you don't want to make important decisions today. It's not that you should let go of your objectives; it's just that you have a lot to gain now by following an intelligent friend or partner for a while. Don't worry about a missed opportunity because a new situation for advancement at your current job is likely. Paradoxically, easing off on your grip can actually solidify your position and increase the possibility of doing something special."
capricorn,2011-06-06,"Don't be afraid to ask for help navigating through unfamiliar territory today. It's hard to make sense of it all because there could be one too many options, leaving you overwhelmed and exhausted from trying to figure it all out. Your stress multiplies if you believe that your decision must be final now. Rest assured that you will still be able to change your mind later without much difficulty at all."
aquarius,2011-06-06,"Instead of booking your day too rigidly, try giving yourself the flexibility you need. One way to accomplish this is to leave large blocks of time completely unstructured for you to do as you please. It may also help to examine your motives for keeping so busy. Remember, you don't have to put lots of activities on your schedule now in order to be considered a success."
pisces,2011-06-06,"Talking about your feelings can help to dissipate negativity, but you could easily go overboard now and pretend that everything is fine. You must be careful not to whitewash the truth just because it's not pretty. Don't worry about other people's reactions to your opinion; instead, concentrate on the usefulness and accuracy of your message. Avoid the temptation to share your personal information as a way to get your friends and workmates to take notice."
aries,2011-06-07,"You may feel as if so much has happened and your life has changed a lot these past few months. However, the stability that you once counted on has faded. Fortunately, today could offer you small victories in your current battle of regaining control. But don't swing into action too quickly or you might run off in the wrong direction to fix problems that can wait. Ask someone you trust to help you set new priorities before you make a mistake."
taurus,2011-06-07,"You might not be the first to come up with the answer to a problem today, but your solution is worth waiting for. Your idea may seem overly simplistic, but it's hard to argue with your rock-solid logic. Ironically, all the pieces of your plan fit so well together that others could suspect you of hiding something. Don't be tempted to back off just to settle someone else's fears. Stick to what you know is true and the resistance will dissipate."
gemini,2011-06-07,"There won't likely be any unexpected surprises today because rational Mercury in your clever sign harmoniously trines serious Saturn. You are standing on a firm foundation now upon which you can build a reliable action plan. But don't be satisfied with the status quo; instead, establish new goals that extend beyond your current ones. Try not to miss this opportunity to apply your analytical skills, while your logic is as good as it gets."
cancer,2011-06-07,"The intensity of your desires doesn't let up as clarity replaces anxiety. If your plans have been ambiguous lately because you couldn't make a decision, now the fog clears, giving you the ability to perceive what's ahead. Making choices about how to best tie up loose ends is a smart idea today if you want to be ready for the future. You might be surprised at how much you actually accomplish if you just diligently work at a steady pace."
leo,2011-06-07,"You may believe that you're running out of time as the Moon leaves your sign today. Although your anxiety is likely self-imposed now, you grow calmer as the day proceeds. There's no need to push yourself too hard; your current fear of failure is probably unwarranted. Do whatever you can without having unrealistic expectations, then set new goals tomorrow when your far-sighted vision improves."
virgo,2011-06-07,"You may be more unconventional than others realize, even if it appears that you're following the party line. Your ideas might be quite progressive, yet hiding them now is a good idea so you don't seem out of place at work. Luckily, you have the ability to concentrate fully on your career. Fortunately, your singular focus may be enough to ease the developing pressure in other areas of your life at this time."
libra,2011-06-07,"You take your role as mediator very seriously today, but others may be growing tired of your desire to fix relationships that don't live up to your standards. Your friends and associates honestly believe that you've done enough and that it's now time for you to back off. However, you are more patient than usual and you are willing to wait before making your next move. Just remember that it's not a smart idea to make decisions for anyone else before you attend to your own."
scorpio,2011-06-07,"You can achieve a certain satisfaction now, even if the circumstances of your current relationships are complicated. Your reasoning is sound and you can effectively think through all the possibilities before saying something that you might later regret. Nevertheless, it's still smart to acknowledge old insecurities so they don't get in your way. Unresolved issues can make you anxious, provoking you to disclose secrets that you would rather keep to yourself a while longer. Consider your audience before you utter a word."
sagittarius,2011-06-07,"You may be considering ways to stabilize a relationship because your partner seems to be acting somewhat flighty now. On one hand, you're tempted to take desperate action if you see someone you care about slipping away. But rather than panicking needlessly, this is the time for cool and collected actions. Slow down and think everything through first. Your rational approach of sharing your concerns in a non-judgmental manner will allow others to meet you halfway."
capricorn,2011-06-07,"It may feel as if your schedule has become so busy that it's growing unmanageable. Thankfully, you are blessed with organizational superpowers today as clever Mercury in your 6th House of Work forms an easy trine with sensible Saturn in your 10th House of Career. But attempting to accomplish too much can be disastrous now, so don't try to do everything all at once. For the best results, set priorities, make a list and then methodically check off the items one at a time."
aquarius,2011-06-07,"This is a great day to put your travel schedule together for an upcoming trip. Or, if you are considering a new course of study, now is the time to make it happen. In fact, all forms of growth are favored today, so enroll in that class or book your plane tickets. Your positive attitude goes a long way on your road to success, so if you're seeking adventure, there's no reason to wait any longer."
pisces,2011-06-07,"If you have been putting off a major decision, today is your day to deliver your final answer. However, you won't likely act impulsively as communicator Mercury receives a helping hand from reserved Saturn, adding a cool logic to your thought process. Following a hunch often works for you, but now cold hard facts will take you even further. Remember that your best choices are made with both your head and your heart."
aries,2011-06-08,"The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Routine can raise your anxiety level today if you cannot figure out a way to complete everything that you promised. Naturally, it's not a good idea to blame anyone else for things that are ultimately your responsibility. Fortunately, you are able to approach your dilemma in a mature manner, gently sharing your concerns with those involved instead of dwelling on the past. Focusing on what needs to be done in the present moment elicits cooperation instead of conflict."
taurus,2011-06-08,"You might not feel secure enough to reveal what's actually on your mind because you're afraid that the reaction you'll receive won't be in your favor. However, if you only share some of your emotions, you could set up a situation where you inadvertently alienate a close friend or lover. Your attempt to withhold parts of your story will be more apparent than you realize. It is better to simply tell everything and then deal with whatever fallout occurs."
gemini,2011-06-08,"The cautious Virgo Moon squares the Sun in your sign today, requiring you to think twice before you act. You may feel as if you should restrain yourself and you're not too happy about needing to withhold your desires. However, suppression only makes matters worse; it's smarter to acknowledge potential problems before they fully develop. If your plans aren't adequate enough to do the job, work on improving them now -- not after the fact."
cancer,2011-06-08,"You have an exciting opportunity to see beyond your previously set agenda, but you may need to let go of an immediate goal. However, this shouldn't be considered a failure since your current course might not be the best way to reach your destination anyhow, even if it seems like a direct route. Forget about your preconceived conclusions and create a new map that's based on today's information instead of yesterday's news."
leo,2011-06-08,"Your workweek might not be going according to plan, but it could turn out fine as long as you don't try to control everything. Paradoxically, the more you resist change, the harder it is for you to adapt. Set your short-term goals aside for a day or two and think about the distant future while you respond to the current circumstances the best you can. Remember, this is not about sacrificing important values; it's about avoiding self-doubt."
virgo,2011-06-08,"The Moon's visit to your sign can raise worries as you try to balance your feelings with your current objectives at work. You may be able to put your best foot forward now by acting more confident than you feel, only to realize that your workmates expect more out of you. Don't be afraid to acknowledge your limitations. Your honesty will be refreshing to others, motivating them to come to your support."
libra,2011-06-08,"Your role at work is slowly but profoundly transforming as others begin to acknowledge your authority. Only recently, you might have had to struggle to get your opinion heard, but now your astute perspective is in demand. However, overextending your control may bring your success to a halt. Remember, it's not important to be on top as long as you have your hand in creating the big changes that are unfolding."
scorpio,2011-06-08,"Relationships are not as complicated as they seem, even if your feelings are more intense than others want to deal with today. You are eager to work on your communication style, but you need to be noticed for your efforts. Unfortunately, painful memories can cloud your mind, making it harder to hear the positive feedback you receive. Try not to let old emotional tapes get in the way of any praise that comes your way now."
sagittarius,2011-06-08,"Your key planet Jupiter harmonizes with imaginative Neptune today, activating your vision of an ideal future. Although your new goals may not be fully grounded in reality, they can still inspire you to work harder to break through old limitations. However, it might seem as if your current work duties are standing in your way of your long-term success. Don't make any significant changes just yet; fulfilling your immediate responsibilities may help your progress more than you realize."
capricorn,2011-06-08,"You are at a fork in the road and events at work may create a minor crisis today, requiring you to choose which route to take. Fortunately, you are not restrained by the usual set of rules, enabling you to find a solution where others have already failed. Ironically, accepting a new responsibility could prove to get in your way of success. Remember, your ability to remain detached from the outcome is what gives you the winning strategy."
aquarius,2011-06-08,"You might actively disagree with someone at work today and think that a heated argument is needed in order to shift the energy. However, conflict won't bring you any closer to the truth, and may even add to the existing animosity. You can be highly productive if you don't become distracted by a petty disagreement. Instead of allowing yourself to get hooked by your emotions, rise above any difference of opinion and commit to working for the highest cause."
pisces,2011-06-08,"You may appear somewhat lost today as the magnifying lens of Jupiter hooks up with illusory Neptune to make your dreams seem vividly real. Fortunately, you are more practical than usual now, for the exacting Virgo Moon sharpens your senses. Don't worry about what others may be thinking; they will soon recognize the usefulness of your ideas as your plans take shape over the days ahead."
aries,2011-06-09,"You want to explore the potential for fun now, and may grow resentful if you cannot escape your responsibilities at work. Anyone who stands in your way might become the target of your misplaced anger. Fortunately, you are able to compromise if you can acknowledge that your desires may be a bit extreme today. Unfortunately, you can't always live in the moment; you'll be happier if you balance your need for immediate gratification with your respect for promises already made."
taurus,2011-06-09,"Your finances might not be able to stretch far enough for you to enjoy the luxuries you think you deserve now. If you just impulsively say yes to your whims, you'll end up concerned that you can't afford your grandiose adventure. However, scaling back your plans prior to making a commitment could be your ticket to success. Being practical before the fact is much wiser than having to deal with a reality check while you're already in motion."
gemini,2011-06-09,"Friendly Venus enters your adaptable sign, but although you're in your element, unspoken demands could prevent you from wandering off in search of pleasure. Unfortunately, someone's unrealistic expectations may be complicating your life now. No matter what kind of relationship complexities you face, taking each situation by itself makes the overall energy easier to handle."
cancer,2011-06-09,"You may be unclear about what you want now that Venus has moved into your 12th House of Fantasy. Although your thoughts are noisy, you probably won't share them today, especially if you believe that someone could use your words against you. But your fear might also prevent you from receiving love. Don't be sure that you can read other people's motives. Stay flexible and be open to others even if support doesn't arrive in the exact manner you expect."
leo,2011-06-09,"Although you can accept the importance of adhering to the rules of the game, you are also able to rationalize doing things your own way. It's challenging for you to operate without a plan because you like to know exactly what you're doing. Now, however, it may be to your advantage to fly by the seat of your pants. It can be scary to make it up as you go along, but your flexibility enables you to take advantage of the moment."
virgo,2011-06-09,"Venus enters flexible Gemini today, showing you that several different roads can lead to your desired destination. Unfortunately, you may lose sight of your initial goal if you spend too much time wondering if one route is more efficient than the others. Thankfully, your dreams will be within reach once you accept that moving forward is more important than answering an irrelevant question."
libra,2011-06-09,"You could experience mood swings as the Moon returns to your sign today, but each emotional wave may seem more significant than the passing feeling actually is. Be careful of falling into a fruitless loop; endlessly analyzing your emotions is a waste of your energy now. Instead of engaging in impractical philosophical discussions about the meaning of your life, just sit back and enjoy the show as your mind jumps through hoops in order to justify your desires."
scorpio,2011-06-09,"Before impulsively reacting to a changing set of circumstances, you're better off contemplating your response. However, when required to shoot from the hip you do it well. You might wish that you had everything mapped out now, but you need to be ready to fill in the details as the power dynamics of a situation change. Remember that a significant opportunity could be lost today if you aren't willing to be flexible."
sagittarius,2011-06-09,"You are eager to give others the benefit of the doubt now that charming Venus is visiting your 7th House of Relationships. Luckily, if someone pulls you out of emotional balance today, there's no urgency to fight back to reclaim your equilibrium. It's wiser to analyze your anxiety without attempting to blame anyone else. Answers come from your internal sense of peace and are not dependent on external circumstances."
capricorn,2011-06-09,"Warrior Mars crosses swords with powerful Pluto in your sign today, stirring up conflict with a stubborn opponent. You may feel as if you're being provoked, but your resistance to change prompts you to react with fear rather than hope. Once you realize that your need to be in control is casting scary shadows, you'll begin to see silver linings instead of dark clouds. Remaining open to change could be enough to bring balance to your life."
aquarius,2011-06-09,"You are lighter on your feet and quicker with your reactions now that Venus and Mercury are in jumping Gemini. Although you're able to charm a potential adversary with your sharp wit, your thoughts could be moving so fast that you blurt out the wrong thing. You cannot take your words back if you step over the line of social acceptability, so don't waste energy trying to fix your controversial outburst. Simply say that you're sorry for your blunder and move on."
pisces,2011-06-09,"Talking about your past might seem like a smart idea with three planets traveling through your 4th House of Roots, but it may not have the effect you want. Your casual disclosure to a friend could have an unexpected impact and unlock a powerful emotional reaction. But don't try to avoid the intensity; let the energy run its course and then decide what to say after everything settles back down."
aries,2011-06-10,"It's challenging to know what to do today if your friends send you mixed messages. You may feel as if others set clear limits and then, once you acknowledge them by your actions, they wonder why you have withdrawn. Both of you are confused by the other person's reactions as you alternate between reality and fantasy. Although the truth seems to fluctuate, your most intelligent strategy is to fall back on communication. If in doubt, check it out."
taurus,2011-06-10,"Your planetary ruler Venus may leave you befuddled today as she squares delusional Neptune. On the other hand, this aspect can also activate your highest ideals. Although this can play out in the realm of relationships, the current activation of your 2nd House of Finances is likely to create a lack of clarity around money issues. Don't make any unnecessary expenditures since your desires may change dramatically over the next several days."
gemini,2011-06-10,"It's difficult to concentrate today because Venus, the planet of personal attractions, is doing battle with Neptune, the planet of spiritual attractions. Venus is in dualistic Gemini, making you feel pulled in two entirely different directions, even if the consequences of your choices aren't very clear. Don't give in to temptation now; try to listen to the cool voice of reason instead of letting your imagination run wild."
cancer,2011-06-10,"Your dreams are in bright colors today, but the beauty of the images is less important than the serious message that the symbols convey. However, it's not a good idea to be too concrete in your interpretations, for your imposed logic could squelch your creative high. Instead, do whatever you can to capture the magical energy that is flowing through you. And if others want you to report on your current actions, tell them that you require more time to put your facts in order."
leo,2011-06-10,"You may not be ready to share what's on your mind because you can see everything in the form of visions today, and words cannot easily communicate their subtlety. Taking time for things to settle down will enable you to make smarter choices about how much to verbalize. Until you know for sure, it's wiser to err on the side of discretion. You can always tell more later; however, once you start to open up, you won't be able to take back what has already been said."
virgo,2011-06-10,"Venus' square to fuzzy Neptune in your 7th House of Others could make others seem more wishy-washy today. It doesn't matter what you say, they still won't be specific enough. You can't respond to the current circumstances if everyone stops short of speaking their mind. Instead of making someone angry with your incorrect assumptions, wait for a couple of days and then start your search for the truth again when you have more information at your disposal."
libra,2011-06-10,"Your key planet Venus is in your 9th House of Big Ideas yet her square to diffusive Neptune makes it difficult to know exactly what you want. You may be overwhelmed by your dreams of an ideal vacation or your attraction to a new philosophy or religion. But when you get closer to your imagined future, it crumbles before your eyes. Don't accept defeat; create a more realistic set of goals and try again."
scorpio,2011-06-10,"Your current approach to love is gentler than usual, but it's still very much you, even if your desires are colored by your vulnerability today. Nevertheless, it's okay to trust the innate wisdom of the universe; you probably don't need to keep to yourself as much as you think. Remember that others may not understand your actions now, so it's wise to take time and explain yourself as clearly as possible."
sagittarius,2011-06-10,"You might try to keep your feelings in check today, but your desire to be heard will probably win out over your need to play it safe. Unfortunately, your message may be muddled because you don't actually know what you want, and the more you say the worse it gets. Don't bother trying to explain yourself yet. Thankfully, you should do better when your clarity begins to return tomorrow."
capricorn,2011-06-10,"You're in for a bit of melodrama today as your plans stumble over your lack of execution. Even if you usually have a knack for making your dreams come true, your ideas may be less practical than you think. You may take a second stab at reaching your destination and could gain better traction later in the day. But don't turn back; inching forward slowly is still much better than turning around and giving up too soon."
aquarius,2011-06-10,"You may need to field an unexpected curve ball today that impacts your financial condition. Although you might believe that you were doing okay, you could overlook an apparently unimportant detail that suddenly becomes problematic. Fortunately, you can react quickly by coming up with a very unique solution as long as you don't assume that you are in complete control. Flexibility is your secret weapon now."
pisces,2011-06-10,"Venus squares Neptune in sensitive Pisces, tempting you to wear your heart on your sleeve today. But you may be somewhat confused because you aren't sure if others are reading you correctly or not. Actually, those close to you will be able to sense your emotions before you say anything at all. Avoid overcompensating by talking too much and diluting your message. You can create magic now without uttering a word."
aries,2011-06-11,"You may not be able to say no today because your enthusiasm is running high. You are sure that it is wise to give everyone the same chances that you want for yourself. But your desire to motivate others isn't specifically about the value of any one specific idea; rather, you want your friends and acquaintances to succeed no matter what. For now, being supportive is more important than anything else."
taurus,2011-06-11,"It seems natural to think in philosophical terms about your future, because expansive Jupiter is now in your sign. Fortunately, this does not mean that you're being illogical. To the contrary, your reasoning is probably very sound if you remember to be comfortable. But there's no reason to grow combative, even if someone is pushing your buttons. Take everything in stride, even if your plans encounter resistance from someone who thinks they know what's best for you."
gemini,2011-06-11,"You may be somewhat ambivalent today about the potential of a particular romance. Although you could have a fantastic opportunity to deepen a friendship, you'll need to make decisions about the direction of your relationship. What's most important now is that you listen to your heart. Don't compromise your integrity for the sake of a passing pleasure."
cancer,2011-06-11,"Although you have been looking forward to some time by yourself this weekend, it's not likely to happen today. You are busy now with significant tasks that are still leftover from last week. Thankfully, you can avoid feeling overwhelmed by prioritizing your chores. Don't try to accomplish everything in one day or you could feel discouraged if you fall short of finishing your goals."
leo,2011-06-11,"Your feelings grow sharper throughout the evening, so if you want to share what is in your heart, save it for later in the day. However, the stakes continue to rise, so a clear and cool head just might be your best weapon now. Don't get so caught up in any one moment that you lose sight of the big picture in a significant relationship."
virgo,2011-06-11,"You may not feel like your regular self these days because you're so eager to share your thoughts without thinking about them first. It's hard to withhold your brilliant ideas; you prefer to get it all out on the table. But your torrent of words can be disruptive to your life. The simple winds of fate are blowing strong now, so you might as well wait and see where they are going to take you before you invest too much energy into a dream."
libra,2011-06-11,"You won't have much control over your schedule today because disruptions keep catching you off guard. Questioning your ability to do a good job may be unavoidable, but this is no time to be feeling ineffective. Accept whatever you can't change and focus your intentions where they can do the most to further your goals."
scorpio,2011-06-11,"You are confronted with endings and beginnings today as the Moon returns for her monthly visit to your transformative sign. Once begun, the process of metamorphosis is total and it is capable of overcoming most natural resistance. There's no need for discouragement. The new cycle may require a few days to take form, so don't expect too much change too soon."
sagittarius,2011-06-11,"There are several areas of your life now undergoing transition, making it difficult to pick just one to talk about. However, you must look back into your past and deep into your soul as you search for the truths that support your goals and guide you into the future. You don't have to tell anyone about your inner journey today; it's yours alone and you get to choose how much you want to share."
capricorn,2011-06-11,"Although it may be your day off today, your focus is still on your position in the outer world because the Moon is in your 10th House of Public Responsibility for most of the day. Unfortunately, you might wish that you didn't have so many obligations because you would prefer some time to yourself. This desire for solitude becomes more of an issue throughout the day so it's smarter to get your work done as soon as possible. Once your chores are finished, you are free to do as you wish."
aquarius,2011-06-11,"You have recently been thinking about doing something adventurous, but today you may be more concerned about your immediate responsibilities. Nevertheless, you're still tempted to walk away from your chores because there are so many other things you would rather be doing. Remember, the weekend isn't over yet, so go ahead and put off work for a little while. Just make certain that you leave time to fulfill your promises before the day is over."
pisces,2011-06-11,"Something has changed, yet it's hard to figure out exactly what it is. You may sound like a detective today as you dig for the missing facts, but your questioning can turn into an obsession and pull you away from other activities. There's nothing wrong with feeling your way through the unfamiliar realms of the new emotional landscape. You don't need to have all the answers right now."
aries,2011-06-12,"Relationships may appear to be out of control, but you aren't too worried because you are confident that you can pull everything back together. Actually, you might even enjoy all the action today. Surprisingly, you could get what you want if you maintain a healthy perspective so you don't act too impulsively. Slow down and turn on your charm; your witty ways may score you the extra points you seek if you remember not to push things too far."
taurus,2011-06-12,"This may be an exciting day as reality gives a boost to your aspirations, tempting you to reach beyond your current goals. Although you realize that the sky is the limit, you are quite concerned about others taking your ideas in a different direction than you want. There is more going on behind the scenes and you are rather intrigued by the notion of untangling all the threads to figure it out. Keep in mind that you might do better by stepping back and letting someone else take charge for a while."
gemini,2011-06-12,"Brilliant ideas keep popping into awareness, enticing you into desiring more than you currently have. Unfortunately, your fantasies may only be fleeting and will soon fade back into the vast reaches of your subconscious. Although it's challenging to slow down your thoughts, it's best not to overdo it with too much caffeine or too many exciting activities. Enjoy the buzz without going over the edge."
cancer,2011-06-12,"You may be dreaming of performing on stage today, but you probably get nervous just thinking about being in front of so many people. However, if you are not able to do your own thing creatively, you might try exploring ways to ease your anxiety. One key to your current happiness is your willingness to reach out to others; talking about your fears is a sensible first step to overcoming your own resistance."
leo,2011-06-12,"You may be required to face angels and demons of your own making today. You could be drawn toward a lovely person, only to realize that you've stepped outside your regular comfort zone. Setting sensible boundaries is a smart strategy, but you must follow through by enforcing them. Thankfully, the power of positive thought can be worth more now than anything else. It's better to associate with optimistic people than someone who brings you down."
virgo,2011-06-12,"You might not be clear about what is expected of you now, but that won't likely prevent you from trying to be everything to everyone. Naturally, it makes more sense to focus and find the clarity you need, especially since your key planet Mercury is aligning with the brilliant Sun. However, don't downplay your desires today, even if they seem out of character. Remember that logical analysis can only take you so far; exploring unfamiliar territory may be just what the doctor ordered."
libra,2011-06-12,"You may obsess about someone or something today and you're tempted to go overboard in order to reach satisfaction. Your visions of the future can drive you further than logic. Meanwhile, your desires may seem out of control because your key planet Venus aligns with rebellious Uranus, making it difficult for you to know when to stop. Peace arrives when you can find a healthy balance between what you have and what you want."
scorpio,2011-06-12,It feels exhilarating today when you express your desires because what you say appears to be heard. You don't want anyone to fix anything; you only need acknowledgment from someone who won't disappear when the emotional pressure builds. The Moon's visit to your sign deepens your intensity and pumps up your adrenaline until you are all wound up. Keep in mind that you don't have to push anyone past his or her resistance just because you've moved through yours.
sagittarius,2011-06-12,"Your words have great impact now as talkative Mercury lines up with the Sun in your 7th House of Partnerships. However, rather than motivating others with an inspirational talk, you may want to set your work aside to pursue simple pleasures. Although having fun is usually your top priority, today you have cosmic messages to deliver first."
capricorn,2011-06-12,"Your ability to stay on course may be tested today, but you should be able to develop the momentum necessary to do the job. However, your route may be circuitous, and veering off course for a bit could be the best way to reach your targets. You might feel as if your current goals are unattainable, but getting discouraged won't help. Do whatever is necessary to keep your spirits high, including yoga, meditation or exercise. These activities won't increase your productivity, but can help you find the elusive balance that you seek."
aquarius,2011-06-12,"You might not be able to settle down today because your mind is crackling with excitement. You could even fall in love or, at minimum, eagerly flirt with someone worthy of your admiration. However, if the action heats up, you may wish to withdraw to a more secure place. Emotional connections are important, but it's also wise to spend time establishing a new routine. Don't try to do too much now, for incremental change is easier to manage than turning your entire life inside out."
pisces,2011-06-12,"The energy at home today may not feel as stable as you would prefer with erratic Uranus buzzing romantic Venus in your 4th House of Family. You have things to say, but may be fearful that your honesty could stir up more trouble than it's worth. However, worrying about what others think could prevent you from taking much-needed action. Speak from your heart and deal with the consequences as you go along."
aries,2011-06-13,"It may be difficult to make your point today because you might be so serious that you scare someone away before you explain what's on your mind. Once you realize what's happening, you're tempted to overcompensate and become so accommodating that you back away from even broaching the topic. Although you could feel pushed and pulled by the changing tides, it's still possible to be effective. Take your time and think about what you're going to say before you open your mouth."
taurus,2011-06-13,"It has become more complicated to say something that may have been easier to share last week. Somehow, the current situation has changed so much that you could be feeling insecure about expressing your feelings. Although you might muster up the courage to finish a recent conversation, you're quickly tempted to abandon your plans. There's no need to overreact; take the additional time required to resolve a delicate relationship issue."
gemini,2011-06-13,"You might be looking forward to enjoying the company of a friend, but first there is that annoying problem of your job. You're ready for a good time, yet it would be wise to treat your obligations seriously first. Once your work is done, you can create a bit of adventure in your personal life. Naturally, you could go off and do something by yourself, but the Moon's shift into your 7th House of Companions indicates that you'd have much more fun being with others."
cancer,2011-06-13,"A lazy morning sounds ideal to you today even if your job or school is beckoning. Unfortunately, circumstances probably won't let you have the downtime you seek until late this evening or tomorrow. There are too many tasks on your agenda, preventing you from settling in at home. Thankfully, if you psych yourself up to meet your deadlines, you are able to have fun, even while doing your work."
leo,2011-06-13,"You may have family responsibilities that you cannot avoid today, but you could get a second wind later in the day and end up doing something special that you enjoy. If it's been a struggle lately to express your feelings about a complicated domestic matter, you might finally find a way that works now. Your new positive attitude can lighten and brighten your evening. Don't waste energy worrying about your upcoming deadlines; instead, use your optimism to motivate you to do your best."
virgo,2011-06-13,"Although you may try to focus on the tasks you must finish today, you'll probably grow more distracted as the day unfolds. However, your ability to cleverly hide your scattered energy behind a smokescreen of productivity prevents others from seeing that you've temporarily lost your way. You know how much more you could accomplish if you concentrate now, so avoid disappointment by restating your intent and pulling yourself back onto the path."
libra,2011-06-13,"Everything seems to take longer today because it's difficult for you to shift into high gear. Even if you believe that many exciting experiences are waiting around the corner, you aren't ready for them just yet. Fortunately, the energy picks up later in the day when the possibility of fun becomes a motivational factor. But don't hesitate until it's too late; plan for pleasure while there's still enough time to make it happen."
scorpio,2011-06-13,"You like the idea of slowing down the pace of your life, but turning your intentions into reality may require at least one more day. Still, it's healthy to realize that whatever you are doing today may not be as urgent as it seems. Even if there's a lot to accomplish, don't wear yourself out. Schedule time to rest and relax over the next couple of days because you will need your energy later in the week."
sagittarius,2011-06-13,"You're eager for tomorrow to arrive because the Moon's current visit to your 12th House of Secrets makes it difficult for you to feel comfortable sharing your ideas. It may seem as if someone in particular is thwarting your progress, but the outer resistance is more likely a projection of your own uncertainty. Thankfully, your instincts are correct; this temporary condition will pass after your emotions play through their natural process."
capricorn,2011-06-13,"You have enough common sense to recognize that one of your pet ideas may have finally run its course. One phase is coming to an end, yet it isn't time to move on. Nevertheless, it can be helpful to visualize what your world might be like once your old assumptions fade. Remember, the power of your imagination is growing stronger now and could enable you to turn your dreams into something really special."
aquarius,2011-06-13,"A recent failure may still be preventing you from seeing the positive potential of unstable dynamics now at play in your life. Being afraid of what's around the next corner could have a negative impact. Fortunately, you are at a turning point and can gain a lot by facing your insecurities. Overcoming anxiety based on your past enables you to create your future. Transforming fear into hope is a sensible strategy whenever possible."
pisces,2011-06-13,"You may need to handle more responsibility this week than you want. You would prefer to wander aimlessly and explore which dreams to follow now. Nevertheless, others are looking to you for inspiration and you don't want to let them down. Instead of worrying about what could possibly go wrong, concentrate on doing the greatest good. Don't be overly concerned with the details; just keep your mind set on your destination."
aries,2011-06-14,"You may think that you're going to cruise through the day, but that's because you aren't expecting the obstacles that might appear in your path today. Your intended playtime quickly shrinks because meeting your obligations takes longer than you expected. Unfortunately, having a great idea doesn't necessarily mean that you have a workable plan. You need to initiate action to get things going now or you won't be able to take some time off for fun later."
taurus,2011-06-14,"You have responsibilities that take precedence over everything else today, so don't accept a new job unless you believe it to be very important. If you promise to do something simply because of social or family pressure, you'll probably fail anyhow. However, if your heart is fully engaged, then things should fall into place, even if it's a struggle at the beginning. Don't even try to assess your progress for several weeks; concentrate on the long-term picture, instead."
gemini,2011-06-14,"Your focus is on relationships now that the Moon is visiting your 7th House of Partners. Although the farseeing Sagittarius Moon encourages you to set lofty goals, you might encounter someone who embodies the Sagittarius spirit of big thinking. But don't get overly excited or you could inflate one another's expectations so much that your dreams become impossible to reach. Sharing your enthusiasm is a great place to start as long as you also have a practical plan in mind."
cancer,2011-06-14,"Although the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Employment doubles your workload, you may believe that you can finish everything in a very short period of time. Unfortunately, you are being very impractical with your optimistic assessment. Luckily, your amazing friends come to the rescue by offering to help. But leaning on them too much isn't a good idea right now because they may not be as reliable as you wish. Nevertheless, some assistance is better than none at all."
leo,2011-06-14,"Your friends may be moving too quickly for you today. It's not that you are unable to keep up with them; it's just that you are bored of engaging in clever conversations without any lasting meaning. Unfortunately, going along with the group can backfire when your level of frustration rises, prompting you to express exactly what you feel. Balancing your abrupt words with a little sensitivity is wise since you might not realize the power of your message."
virgo,2011-06-14,"Your high expectations are not a guarantee that anyone will deliver exactly what you want. It may even be your boss or someone in power that lets you down today. Although you are able to recognize the dynamics, it's still challenging for you to let go of your preferences. Protect yourself from being disappointed by remembering that other people's actions are beyond your control. However, you can always change your response."
libra,2011-06-14,"A current relationship could become awkward today. It may be apparent that you each want something different and although you both talk about compromise, neither of you are in the mood to negotiate. Unfortunately, it's tough to sustain a heart connection while you are disagreeing about basic values. Don't waste your energy trying to resolve the current tension; you'll only feel worse if you attempt to force a resolution now. Fortunately, a conflict will likely dissipate on its own in a few days."
scorpio,2011-06-14,"You might be frustrated by someone's behavior today. A loving friend is only trying to help, but chances are that everyone else's solutions will be so far off target that assistance from others is more troublesome now than productive. You may be left feeling that no one truly understands what you need. Don't try to justify your beliefs; just retreat enough to reclaim your center of gravity and then move on."
sagittarius,2011-06-14,"The Moon's current visit to your sign might be overwhelming if you are flooded with emotional messages that contradict each other. You wish you could set aside logic, but it's smart to resist the temptation to react to every single whim. Instead of being irrational, observe your changing moods until they reveal a larger story. Being patient with your process allows you to honor your feelings while also acting in a responsible manner."
capricorn,2011-06-14,"The pursuit of love may be unsatisfying today if an unattainable goal leads you around like a carrot on a stick. You could waste precious time chasing an unreachable dream if you don't pay attention to the bigger picture. Fortunately, you can redirect your focus toward more practical goals by consciously changing your priorities. Once you have decided on a sensible destination, your hard work will pave the road to success."
aquarius,2011-06-14,"You want to socialize today as the Moon moves through your 11th House of Networking, but previous commitments may require so much energy that you don't have enough time. Your quiet frustration could turn to anger, but there doesn't seem to be an available outlet for your emotions now. In spite of your desire to be with others, a temporary retreat could be what's needed to shift the current dynamics. You might not have the best plan, so be as flexible as possible and don't try to control everything."
pisces,2011-06-14,"You Fish may feel as if you have been left high and dry today. Professional demands require logical long-term planning, yet your heart's desires could get left out of the equation. There is a significant amount of activity in your life now, and your personal needs might have to be put on hold so you can manage the complexity of the present moment. This state of emotional suppression is temporary; give it a few days to see where this strategy leads before trying a new approach."
aries,2011-06-15,"You believe that you can justify almost anything you want to do today; however, your logic might not seem all that rational to someone else. Even if your motives are admirable, your impulsive behavior may not go over well with others. Be careful of your overconfidence leading you to do something you will later regret. Keep in mind that it's wiser to heed the cautionary advice that you're given now, even if it temporarily puts a crimp in your style."
taurus,2011-06-15,"You might have wonderful ideas today, but could lack a clear plan that helps you reach your goals. Although your footing can be shaky now, your sense of urgency motivates you to reach for the stars anyway. Unfortunately, this may not be the best time to start a project, yet you can't wait for some magical moment to arrive when everything is perfect. If you encounter delays along the way, remember that they are not valid reasons to give up hope and walk away."
gemini,2011-06-15,"Your quick wit often helps you smooth over sketchy situations, but you may not be satisfied with this evasive strategy now. You're not interested in hiding your feelings any longer, but facing serious underlying issues isn't as much fun as delivering the next clever comeback. Don't worry about stepping into unfamiliar territory; your friends and family will jump in to help when they realize that you are attempting to keep it real."
cancer,2011-06-15,"Today's inspirational Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 6th House of Details, turning your attention to all the loose ends that are still left untied. But being aware of what you need to do is not the same thing as doing it. Don't try to complete everything now; there is no need to apologize for what remains temporarily unfinished. Handling your chores one at a time will help you to concentrate your efforts and accomplish as much as possible."
leo,2011-06-15,"Although you may not want to admit it, your thoughts are a bit scattered today, challenging you to follow any one idea to its logical conclusion. Thankfully, the fiery Sagittarius Full Moon Eclipse activates your 5th House of Self-Expression, helping to free you from your own self-limiting beliefs. Just don't get so carried away with all of the amazing possibilities that you turn a practical plan into an unrealistic dream."
virgo,2011-06-15,"You could get caught up in a struggle to balance quantity with quality today as the Full Moon Eclipse in boundless Sagittarius whets your appetite for adventure. Unfortunately, your newfound desires might be at odds with your usual preference to narrow your field of perception so you can focus your energy and be more efficient. Consider this eclipse as an opportunity to practice your powers of discrimination. Wrapping up your work early allows you to do something exciting later in the day."
libra,2011-06-15,"This is an information-rich day with the Lunar Eclipse shaking up your 3rd House of Communication. You could even become caught up in a debate without knowing which side is right. Unfortunately, you may have a strong opinion that isn't well thought out. Ironically, withdrawing from the discussion and seeking a quiet place may be your smartest strategy now. Contemplating your own thoughts is healthier than impulsively reacting to someone else's ideas."
scorpio,2011-06-15,"It's easy to overestimate your cash flow with the optimistic Sagittarius Lunar Eclipse illuminating your 2nd House of Money today. On the other hand, you might be fully aware of your financial situation, yet still decide to take a dream vacation anyway. Either way, you could end up discouraged if your fiscal reality doesn't measure up to your wishes. Nevertheless, fretting is a waste of time and energy; save your nickels and dimes, instead."
sagittarius,2011-06-15,"It's not easy to contain your dreams as today's Full Moon Eclipse occurs in your exuberant sign. But rather than going off on your own, you're likely to tag along with a friend or partner when the Moon opposes chatty Mercury in your 7th House of Companions. Unfortunately, you can't rely on others for advice now because they will probably encourage your scheme, even if it's not very practical. Wait until the Moon enters realistic Capricorn tomorrow before embarking on your next big adventure."
capricorn,2011-06-15,"You typically handle your responsibilities early in the day so you can relax later on. But you might feel so overwhelmed by the sheer number of items on your agenda now that you don't know where to begin. Don't despair; instead of starting on your list right away, take time to review your priorities. Once you decide what you're going to do first, break down the job into manageable tasks. Successful small steps assure the steadiest progress."
aquarius,2011-06-15,"The extravagant Sagittarius Lunar Eclipse in your social 11th house tempts you to say yes to every invitation you receive today. Although interacting with others sounds like fun, you may already be overcommitted. Unfortunately, you won't be able to enjoy yourself if you're supposed to be somewhere else. Don't wait until your schedule is out of control; eliminate some of the extraneous activities before you're in over your head. Ironically, you will have more fun if you have less to do."
pisces,2011-06-15,"Today's indulgent Sagittarius Full Moon activates your 10th House of Career, tempting you to set unrealistic professional goals. But it quickly becomes obvious that you cannot live up to your own exaggerated expectations. Ultimately, this Lunar Eclipse can reveal your excesses and require you to restrain your enthusiasm. Gradually apply the brakes to maintain control of your energy before things go awry."
aries,2011-06-16,"Whether or not you're worried about what you're doing, you're still concerned about what others think. Although you might not purposefully try to mislead anyone, you could be tempted to avoid a delicate situation today. Clever Mercury enables you to hide your fancy footwork so that no one realizes that you have taken a shortcut. Nevertheless, your self-esteem still suffers unless you choose to take the high road."
taurus,2011-06-16,"The practical Capricorn Moon reflects your common sense, enabling you to bring a discussion back down to earth. But it's no big deal for you because you aren't interested in wasting time on subtle nuances. It's simple; pay attention to where the rubber meets the road so you can get maximum traction and reach your destination. You'll make progress as long as you don't lose ground today."
gemini,2011-06-16,"You might be in a bit of a panic today because you feel as if time is running out now that interactive Mercury is leaving your sign and shifting into quiet Cancer. You may mistakenly believe that you're losing your intellectual edge. Keep in mind that although the pace of life is already beginning to slow down, you will have plenty of opportunities to accomplish all you want over the weeks ahead."
cancer,2011-06-16,"It's annoying when close friends or family members aren't open-minded enough to accept your feelings. Naturally, you feel more secure when there is a sympathetic resonance between you and others. Your emotional well-being may not be someone else's top priority, but it's still worth your effort to share what is in your heart, even if the response is not as enthusiastic as you expect."
leo,2011-06-16,"Managing your to-do list today is more successful if you can break each chore into smaller tasks now that the Moon is in your 6th House of Details. Instead of simply doing things spontaneously, it currently makes more sense to be very consistent and methodical in your approach. Even if there are unexpected interruptions along the way, make sure you know exactly where you are and what you're going to do next."
virgo,2011-06-16,"Others seem to go out of their way to reassure you about your work today. Their acknowledgment is refreshing because sometimes your workmates criticize you for placing unnecessary importance on the wrong things. However, your attention to details is not usually up for negotiation. Your self-esteem is running high, but it's not helpful if the favorable feedback goes directly to your head. Your smartest strategy is to continue demonstrating your integrity by being as productive as possible."
libra,2011-06-16,"A domestic issue requires your immediate attention today, but this doesn't mean that anything is going wrong. It's just that you might be afraid that personal issues will interfere with your job performance. Establish clear boundaries so you can attend to matters at home and at work while keeping things separate enough that you don't create additional complications."
scorpio,2011-06-16,"You enjoy being busy today, especially since you have a solid plan for reaching your current goals. You're eager to work hard now because you are excited by the potential rewards. But counting on a payoff before you even get started isn't wise and could get in the way of your success. You should be able to handle your obligations if you maintain a healthy sense of realism and have a purpose beyond material gain."
sagittarius,2011-06-16,"The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Personal Possessions indicates that your finances may need some serious attention. Luckily, you have a pretty sensible attitude toward money today. Remember, impulse buying could land you in deep water quickly, so think twice before acquiring anything you don't need. Additionally, the hardworking Capricorn Moon suggests that the wisest approach to spending now is a conservative one."
capricorn,2011-06-16,"You may run into a roadblock if you try to take responsibility for a project now that the Capricorn Moon is squaring Saturn the Tester in your 10th House of Career. Alternatively, you might be upset that others expect so much of you; you wouldn't have to work so hard if everyone else did their fair share. Don't worry; you'll be able to join in the fun later, even if you're the one who is doing all the heavy lifting now."
aquarius,2011-06-16,"Tap the hidden resources within your subconscious mind to make the most out of the cosmic currents today. The Moon's current visit to your 12th House of Fantasy inspires you to take advantage of opportunities as new strategies arise from your imagination. It may not be apparent at first, but the possibilities grow once you give yourself permission to dream. Nevertheless, you still must work within circumstantial constraints in the real world."
pisces,2011-06-16,"Although you may be quite realistic about your goals, it's still challenging to deal with what's on your plate now because you would rather be working in the future than in the present. It's crucial to keep your dreams alive, but you must also respond to each situation as it manifests in your life. It's not wise to lose touch with reality today while focusing on unfulfilled wishes about tomorrow."
aries,2011-06-17,"You are less inclined to start a project today unless you already have a sensible plan in place. Fortunately, the cautious Capricorn Moon increases your ability to think through several contingencies and to map out a sound strategy. Don't limit your options too much; combine your practical approach with your visionary ideas. Your current determination allows you to succeed now when otherwise you might have given up too soon."
taurus,2011-06-17,"It's crucial that you practice self-discipline today because you might struggle if you try to accomplish too much. However, you have an excellent opportunity to finish what you start if you can set attainable goals and then concentrate on the most essential tasks. Positive thinking is a definite plus as long as you don't assume that your attitude is the only thing that matters."
gemini,2011-06-17,"Your key planet Mercury is working overtime today, smoothing over the rough spots in your life. Unfortunately, your ability to rationalize is so natural that you could be the victim of your own cleverness. Be careful not to avoid an unpleasant discussion now because denial can come back and make things difficult later on. Facing the truth won't be as tough as you expect."
cancer,2011-06-17,"You excel at communicating your feelings today now that messenger Mercury is in your sign, but even a close friend might not fully understand your perspective. The problem is that some complex emotions don't fit so easily into language, and something can be lost unless others are listening to what's said in between the words. Remember that your actions also speak loudly, so make sure your behavior is consistent with the message you're trying to get across."
leo,2011-06-17,"Although you may not appear insecure, you still might be overly concerned with a co-worker's feelings today. Your strategy could backfire if you try to hide your anxiety by being purposefully vague. Ultimately, it's wiser to disclose as much information as you can, even if you do it gradually. Your supporters can help you even more if they are fully informed. There's no reason to carry your burden alone."
virgo,2011-06-17,"You may be able to get away with a bit of sloppy thinking or even a bit of trickery today as long as you don't take things too far. Your key planet Mercury is receiving positive vibrations from Jupiter and Neptune, enabling you to turn on the charm and maybe even bring out the salesman in you. Thankfully, others will probably cut you some slack if you make a social blunder. Take advantage of this cosmic assistance while it lasts."
libra,2011-06-17,"You are often able to minimize your needs to make a situation more pleasant for someone else. However, you could easily go overboard now trying to fix an emotional melodrama that isn't really your responsibility. Meddling in other people's affairs usually doesn't help anyone, but you can be a true friend by listening and showing your support. Caring for those you love is wonderful as long as you also remember to take care of yourself."
scorpio,2011-06-17,"Although your emotional needs are naturally complex, you normally keep them to yourself. Your dreams are extremely vivid now and you may be even less interested in having others involved with your inner process. Keep in mind that there's no need to close yourself off completely; confiding in another person can clarify your thoughts and deepen your relationship. Give yourself permission to wait until you're ready to share your fantasies with someone you trust."
sagittarius,2011-06-17,"You are doing a lot of deep thinking now, but you might decide not to go public with your thoughts. Nevertheless, you may come across as if your emotions aren't very important when you talk about them in a detached manner. Ironically, you may believe that changes are occurring, even if nothing happens. Be courageous and find your voice. Take a risk and express what's really in your heart."
capricorn,2011-06-17,"Although obligations quickly fill up your schedule, you still might believe that you can fit more activities into your day. Unfortunately, even the time you set aside for relaxation is now rapidly disappearing. Thankfully, you are able to keep your day from turning completely upside down by making smart choices before things get out of hand. Remember, if you wait too long before taking action, everything will become harder to manage."
aquarius,2011-06-17,"You may be uncomfortable when someone at work gets to you today. Perhaps you have an emotional moment, provoking you to say more than you normally would and initiating a real heart-to-heart moment. It could actually feel good as it's unfolding, but then the mood grows awkward. Don't withdraw too much or you could undo the potentially positive consequences of breaking down an unspoken and unnecessary boundary."
pisces,2011-06-17,"It's easy for you to slip into a caretaker role today because you are very empathetic to what others are thinking. It may be a challenge to avoid feeling like a victim now, but giving too much of yourself too quickly can turn compassion into resentment. You can be more of a help to those you love in the long run if you remember to maintain healthy boundaries."
aries,2011-06-18,"The good news is that you won't have to give up if you face a setback today. However, you will be better off if you pause long enough to listen to the message you're receiving. The current resistance is probably occurring for a reason, even if you choose to avoid it. Thankfully, an obstacle could become more manageable once you understand why it appeared. It's less crucial now to achieve your goal than to integrate the lessons you learn."
taurus,2011-06-18,"You may feel complacent with your life, making it difficult to motivate yourself even if you have a lot to do today. Thankfully, it's easier to sustain your efforts after you finally get moving. But once you find your pace, you won't want to slow down if someone gets in your way. Overreacting won't help you make faster progress, so remember that there may be another point of view that you aren't aware of yet."
gemini,2011-06-18,"Consider conserving your energy today so you don't waste valuable resources running around in circles. However, it's not wise to think of this as a retreat; instead, you need to solidify what you have already gained. You could jeopardize your recent efforts if you react impulsively, but you can make significant progress if you concentrate on your long-term goals."
cancer,2011-06-18,"You prefer to keep your feelings to yourself today, but someone's erratic behavior is likely to push your buttons. Even if you try to let it pass, your thoughts seem to have a life of their own. Just remember that when you do finally choose to express yourself, speak your truth without blaming others. Taking full responsibility for your words will help to avert an unnecessary argument."
leo,2011-06-18,A close friend or partner might not seem very supportive today if he or she acts without taking your feelings into consideration. But you might jump to an incorrect conclusion because you're missing an important piece of information. Don't react too quickly; listen closely to what others have to say now or you could miss your chance to improve your game.
virgo,2011-06-18,"You may feel lonely today, yet you're not as isolated from others as you think. Your true friends will come through with the love and support you need, but they might not be as warm and nurturing as you wish. Nevertheless, your loved ones will be there for you if you don't push them away with your false assumptions about how they should react."
libra,2011-06-18,"You may feel as if someone isn't being very responsible now and you're the one who must pick up the slack. You could quickly grow to resent a friend or co-worker who pressures you to make a decision that you're not yet ready to address. It's difficult to cooperate with those who appear to be manipulating you, but it's healthier to process your discomfort now and express your dissatisfaction another day after your emotions have settled down."
scorpio,2011-06-18,"You may have important goals that are growing clearer day by day, but you aren't yet ready to talk about them. A healthy outlook on your future is a blessing, yet your feelings may be so intense that you could overwhelm someone when you stand up for your beliefs. Fortunately, you are able to avoid a needless argument if you simply remember to tread softly. It just isn't necessary to get bent out of shape over something that ultimately isn't that important."
sagittarius,2011-06-18,"Don't dismiss someone's concerns too quickly, for it's likely less important to you than it is to the person who confides in you. You could miss an opportunity to move a relationship into new realms of intimacy by your unwillingness to partake in a deep discussion. On the other hand, you don't need to find complete resolution right away. Be supportive but avoid getting caught up in a false sense of urgency. There really isn't a rush as long as you are sincerely engaging the process."
capricorn,2011-06-18,"An unexpected interaction with a friend today might reveal that there is more going on than you realize. Even if you can tell that a power issue is lurking in the background, you don't know how to work with the imbalance. You may create more problems than you solve by confronting it. However, you will contribute to the awkward energy if you just let it slide. Although the conversation may be uncomfortable at first, it's still better to talk about your uneasiness before it gets worse."
aquarius,2011-06-18,"Whatever emotions you may be trying to hide today, the current situation is actually your own doing. Harboring resentment about someone at work could provoke you to lose your temper if you don't say what's on your mind. Thankfully, you may receive more support than you expect. Don't try to isolate yourself from others now; lean on your family and friends to help you process your emotions so you can get on with the more important things in your life."
pisces,2011-06-18,"You are learning to find your footing on ground that isn't as stable as it once was. Nevertheless, your spiritual foundation is stronger now, tempting you to express your newfound confidence. However, your bravado can set up a competitive dynamic if others are threatened by your apparent success. Keep your optimism to yourself today; softening your stance to the world can gently relieve tensions before they reach a point of no return."
aries,2011-06-19,"A domestic matter that has been lurking in the background could shift to the forefront today. You might feel as if you're being pushed to say something, even if you are trying to remain neutral. Unfortunately, your words can have more consequences than you expect and might even make things worse. Before you open your mouth, consider whether your disclosure will actually improve the situation. It may be wiser to remain silent for a while longer."
taurus,2011-06-19,"Obsessing about something you should have said to a close friend or family member stirs up unresolved feelings today. But your concerns could be agitated because you're currently overly sensitive to everything in your immediate environment. Although it's healthy to acknowledge your compassion for those close to you, it's also important to remember that you are not responsible for anyone else's emotions. Don't intrude into someone else's life unless you have been specifically invited."
gemini,2011-06-19,"Your ruling planet Mercury engages in a mental war of survival with relentless Pluto today. You may feel as if you're in over your head, but Mercury is clever enough to outwit even the toughest opponent. Thinking quickly enables you to emerge victorious, but only if you're realistic about your limitations. There's no place now for blind optimism. Pay careful attention to everything that is said before making your case as succinctly as you can."
cancer,2011-06-19,"It seems as if someone is pressuring you to say more than you want today as domineering Pluto opposes Mercury in reclusive Cancer. The more others push, the more you resist their efforts. Nevertheless, you still might prefer to have everything out in the open, even if it's challenging for you to move the discussion along. You would be wise to break through your own resistance because nothing will happen if you wait for anyone else to speak for you."
leo,2011-06-19,"Even though your patience may have reached its limit, you're still probably trying to balance your feelings with what others want now. You may be resentful that someone is standing between you and your potential enjoyment. Paradoxically, keeping your negativity to yourself only strengthens it. A smarter strategy is to get your annoyance out in the open. Thankfully, your anger can be transformed once it is seen for what it is."
virgo,2011-06-19,"Your key planet Mercury is visiting your 11th House of Friends where it connects you to others on a deep emotional level. However, its current opposition to shadowy Pluto indicates that your need for personal expression may be overwhelmed by the group process. It's a good idea to let everyone know how you feel as long as you assume complete responsibility for your own emotions. If you don't blame anyone else, no one will be able to fault you for saying what's on your mind."
libra,2011-06-19,"You are often inclined to keep your opinions to yourself in order to maintain the peace, but someone may push your emotional buttons today, provoking you to say more than is necessary. Although it could be wiser to listen to logic, you are motivated by your sense of fair play to set the record straight. Nevertheless, a bit of diplomacy is still a good idea; you can be honest without having to get everything out in the open in one single blast."
scorpio,2011-06-19,"Although interactive Mercury comforts you while it is visiting emotional Cancer, your words seem more confrontational today than you intend. Your key planet Pluto is in a passionate tug-of-war with the cosmic messenger, allowing harsh words to easily slip off your tongue. The consequences of your current honesty could stir up a hornet's nest of complex feelings. Unnecessary stress can be avoided if you stop to consider other people's reactions before you speak."
sagittarius,2011-06-19,"You don't have much patience with others today; it seems as if your window of opportunity is closing and you might lose your chance to say what's on your mind if you don't start an overdue conversation right away. You may be uncomfortable showing your vulnerability, but you are able to quickly adjust to the situation. Your natural confidence is a blessing, but it's still wise to move slowly. Impulsive disclosures tend to be shallow and may not lead to true satisfaction."
capricorn,2011-06-19,"You might be obsessing about a friend or partner today, whether or not the relationship has a viable future. You may even withdraw from others now because retreating from non-essential interactions can be a healthy part of this transit. Letting go is often painful, yet making believe that everything is fine is even worse. You can always choose to reconnect later once you feel more like yourself."
aquarius,2011-06-19,"You may be holding out for a better deal today, but it's probably wise to reconsider your demands and be more open to negotiation. Your natural ability to detach from an emotional situation isn't working now, making it difficult to unhook yourself from a complex web of feelings. Reminding yourself that you are human just like everyone else will make it easier to express what is in your heart."
pisces,2011-06-19,"Although you might attempt to quietly go about your business today, your frustration could build to a breaking point because you believe that others are not being completely honest with you. You would rather hear the truth than waste your energy trying to fill in the missing information. Ironically, the more you question others, the more they withdraw. Ultimately, it's best to pay attention to your own feelings now without pushing for resolution until more facts come to light."
aries,2011-06-20,"A bit of confidence is a good thing, but you could take it too far today. It's unwise to believe that you can do everything you want, so choose your battles very carefully and then give it your best shot. Unfortunately, if you attempt to take on more than you can handle now, you'll quickly wish that your life was moving at a slower pace."
taurus,2011-06-20,"It's a good idea to slow down and concentrate because the interpersonal dynamics at work may be complicated today. Fortunately, you have an intuitive sense that cuts through the complexities of office politics and gets to the core of the issue. Others will look to you for guidance now because they think you know what's going on. Although it's helpful to share your perspective, don't forget that there are many different ways to reach the same destination."
gemini,2011-06-20,"Current circumstances pull you one way today while your fantasies lure you in a totally different direction. On other days your confusion could be problematic, but now it may be the key to balancing your commitments with your dreams. Don't try to limit your thinking with logic because your imagination can offer workable answers that are not restrained by the constraints of the real world."
cancer,2011-06-20,"Hanging out with your friends has been an antidote recently to an uncomfortable relationship situation. Unfortunately, you may feel more vulnerable now and your fear of being hurt motivates you to withdraw into the safety of your own private world. Thankfully, social settings can provide the opportunity for low-key casual interactions that won't stir up too much resistance. Enjoy others without becoming enmeshed in any complicated emotional melodramas."
leo,2011-06-20,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Companions may tempt you to pin your hopes and dreams on someone else now. Although a solid partnership won't likely pose any special difficulties, you are more prone to project your fantasies onto others. Attaching your goals onto those closest to you can naturally alter interpersonal dynamics. Let your mind meander for a while, but don't confuse an enticing daydream with a viable relationship path."
virgo,2011-06-20,"You are growing more enthusiastic about expanding your range of activity now. You're ready to make your move by heading out on an adventure and journeying to new destinations. Perhaps you might even think about a completely different area of study that opens your mind and widens your intellectual horizons. However, make sure to connect your latest venture with the practical side of life, even if your interests are conceptual, like history, literature or philosophy. Keep your feet on the ground or you'll quickly lose interest down the road."
libra,2011-06-20,"The Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression brings out your artistic inclinations now, and you would be wise to put your creativity into motion. Fortunately, you can tap into a deep mother lode of symbolism by allowing yourself to sink into your own silence. But you still need to bring your experiences out into the open and turn them into something that resonates with others."
scorpio,2011-06-20,"You could fall into the trap of needing to be right if someone tries to overpower your reasoning with a false sense of authority. Unfortunately, there is little room for give and take unless both parties are open to what the other is saying. Your current rigidity might motivate your opponent to present an argument so well considered that you are willing to change your mind. Holding on to your position can be a wise move up to a point. Knowing when to jump ship is even smarter."
sagittarius,2011-06-20,"Just because you have a strong opinion about how to do something at work, your certainty doesn't make your idea the best way. Being open to learning from others requires you to let go of your attachment to being right. Forget about proving your superiority; instead, acknowledge that everyone has something special to offer. Respectfully asking your co-workers to share their knowledge and expertise is a sign of your own intelligence."
capricorn,2011-06-20,"Seeking pleasure while at work can also improve your self-esteem today. When you feel better about yourself, you will likely grow more productive in everything that you do. Your new efficiency begins with giving yourself permission to have fun. Ironically, an act of apparent selfishness can replenish your energy and enable you to offer more to others in return."
aquarius,2011-06-20,"The paradox of the day stems from the relationship between simplicity and complexity. Oddly enough, eliminating extraneous noise so you can concentrate on fewer tasks is quite complicated. Interpersonal politics might grow entangled and there's a variety of possible scenarios to be considered now. Nevertheless, you'll be happier once you cut back unnecessary activities. Luckily, your job should get easier once you make the commitment to follow through with whatever you start."
pisces,2011-06-20,"Your outlandish fantasies may take you to distant galaxies or parallel universes while the Moon is traveling through your 12th House of Imagination. However, the real focus now is on what you do and not on what you think. Take the most direct course of action possible, for it will lead you to your desired destination. Make a map and then follow it with unwavering intention."
aries,2011-06-21,"It's no fun when someone gets on your case, but you may as well save your complaining for another day. You won't likely receive a lot of support if an idea of yours cannot stand up to fair criticism. Thankfully, the circumstances aren't as dire as you think. Your contribution can have significant impact if you're willing to learn a tough lesson now and step up your game as needed."
taurus,2011-06-21,"You're still busy, even if you've recently been trying to slow down. Today is a turning point and you can finally begin to regain control. You have been running around chasing your dreams, yet now are required to stop so you can focus on a single issue that demands all your attention. Fortunately, redirecting your thinking process toward real world considerations enables you to set aside extraneous issues and produce more tangible results."
gemini,2011-06-21,"You're not interested in listening to the cool voice of reason today, yet your options could be limited by the current circumstances. Without an apparent way out of your present dilemma, you might have to get serious now and face the music. This is a critical time because you understand that your casual attitude can't make a very real problem disappear. Fortunately, sound thinking can."
cancer,2011-06-21,"You may have recently lost any objectivity that you had, yet today your daydreams can run into some cold, hard truths of reality. Unfortunately, you don't want to leave your fantasies behind, but the longer you avoid your obligations, the more of a challenge it will be to face them in the long run. Starting your work now is smarter than procrastinating any longer."
leo,2011-06-21,Reaching your long-term destination might feel impossible today as you try to sort out where you are in your life. But there is no time for self-pity; you have important work to do now. Don't waste precious time because this small window of opportunity won't remain open too long. Acknowledge anything that isn't working and make changes as needed to get back on track.
virgo,2011-06-21,"You may feel as if you're now being taught a lesson you already know. Unfortunately, your ruling planet Mercury forms a stressful square with taskmaster Saturn today, requiring you to learn what you can, even if it's uncomfortable. Thankfully, the Sun's shift into your futuristic 11th house takes your mind off the present moment and aims you toward your goals. Don't blame others if you have a hard time with criticism. Make the necessary changes within yourself, without trying to change anyone else."
libra,2011-06-21,"Blind optimism transforms into enlightened realism today as your big ideas collide with a serious dose of the truth. Others may believe that your new and open perspective is more life-affirming than if you shut down your heart in fear. Don't judge yourself too harshly, for you cannot possibly know what you don't yet know. The most important thing you can do now is to make the best choices in the present moment before moving on."
scorpio,2011-06-21,"You may want to have a deep conversation with an intimate friend today, but he or she is able to skillfully avoid talking about something unsettling. Or perhaps you are the one cleverly engineering situations to prevent an uncomfortable topic from coming up. Don't let this chance to connect with someone you trust slip by; the opportunity to share your feelings will continue to grow throughout the days ahead."
sagittarius,2011-06-21,"Normally, you are able to see the positive side of nearly anything. You can make just about everything sound better when you are trying to inspire others. Although you get a kick out of banishing gray clouds from the sky, you still might have a tough time today finding something to smile about. Nevertheless, it's imperative for you to hold on to your unique vision, for your optimism touches more people's lives than you realize."
capricorn,2011-06-21,"Your key planet Saturn presents you with a complex dilemma today, for your success appears to be in jeopardy. Your natural reaction is to close down in fear and anticipate the worst. Although your negative expectations aren't enough to skew your whole day, it's not easy to muster up your self-confidence now. Your hard work, coupled with a positive outlook, could put you right back in the driver's seat where you belong."
aquarius,2011-06-21,"Your approach to your job could turn a notch more serious today as Mercury in your 6th House of Employment dynamically squares sobering Saturn. Think about how you can sustain your recent gains and solidify working relationships. If differences of opinion arise now, there's no need to force resolution. Rise above the conflict by acknowledging the opposing viewpoints and then moving on to something you can mutually agree upon."
pisces,2011-06-21,"Disagreements with a lover or a playmate can drain you emotionally today, especially if your partner believes that you're making a fuss over nothing. But your tender feelings may be wounded if someone forgets to respect your wishes and appreciate you for who you are. Resolving discomfort in any relationship still requires your commitment to meet the other person halfway."
aries,2011-06-22,"Saying something with authority doesn't make it true, but pushy Mars' square with deceptive Neptune tempts you to try this ploy as a strategy today. You may actually believe that you can talk someone into seeing the world through your eyes. But overpowering others by insisting you're right only makes you sound foolish, because your rationalizations are more transparent than you realize. There's no need to pretend that you're in control when you're not. Those who know you love you simply for being yourself."
taurus,2011-06-22,"Your future is looking bright today, but you may not be heading in the right direction to actually make your dreams come true. It's not that your goals are unrealistic; it's just that you can underestimate the resources necessary to reach your destination. Thankfully, if you let your imagination wander, you can see possibilities that others miss. Just remember to draw a line to separate fact from fancy or you could be rudely surprised by the outcome."
gemini,2011-06-22,"You may be happy that your brightest dreams are ripe for picking, but don't let your confidence run away with the show while confusing Neptune is in your 10th House of Status. You might believe that you can be successful without working harder, but this illusion will dissipate as circumstances change. If an idealistic fantasy fades as you get closer to it, it's best to let it go and move on to something else."
cancer,2011-06-22,"It may seem as if you have all the words necessary to describe your hopeful feelings today, yet you still cannot initiate a conversation about your dreams of the future. Don't waste energy being self-critical now, for you are wise to keep your vision to yourself until you have a good reason to share it. It's not useful to reveal your plan prematurely or you might create an awkward moment. Be patient and remain quiet just a little bit longer."
leo,2011-06-22,"It feels as if you're in an idyllic social situation today and that everyone seems to support your decisions. You're not even thinking about what you should do next; you're in the flow and everything is just happening naturally. However, your desire for a deeper connection doesn't play well with your current energy, which may be more scattered now. You can maintain the status quo by temporarily keeping your emotions to yourself."
virgo,2011-06-22,"It's challenging to relax today because you're afraid of what may happen if you don't resist the prevailing emotional currents. You would prefer to be rational and in control one hundred percent of the time, but unfortunately you are not. Therefore, your most logical strategy is to avoid getting hooked by your desires. However, attempts to deny your needs give power to whatever you fear most. Escape your regular routine; lead with your imagination and not your analytical thoughts."
libra,2011-06-22,"Starting your job early in the day sounds like an intelligent idea, but nothing seems to go as planned. Your positive attitude is the most important deciding factor now in whether you can put your schedule back on track or if it will completely derail. Don't become too rigid now if you run into an obstacle; being flexible will actually enable you to regain control later."
scorpio,2011-06-22,"You may be quite eager to take the easy way out today. Typically, you stick to your principles, even if your idealistic approach complicates your life. But you have a long-term plan now and you're not willing to jeopardize it over any one particular issue. Although choosing your battles wisely is always a smart strategy, compromising your values can create even more problems down the road."
sagittarius,2011-06-22,"Your imagination is extremely vivid today, encouraging you to mix up your daydreams with your reality. You may actually believe that you can get more done than is possible because everything happens so smoothly in your mind. Unfortunately, each task takes more time than you think. You could end up in trouble if you race through a chore, believing you can make up for lost time. Instead, promise less and deliver more."
capricorn,2011-06-22,"You may fool your workmates today by pretending to be busier than you actually are. If you want to be recognized for your contribution to a project, don't try so hard to make yourself look good. If you take your little song and dance too far, you might inadvertently overstep your bounds. You are better off by just working hard and then letting the chips fall where they may."
aquarius,2011-06-22,"You are extra creative today as Mars, now in your 5th House of Self-Expression, is agitated by imaginative Neptune. However, your production can be delayed or even blocked by your lack of a concrete plan. Nevertheless, you could feel as if you're wasting time managing the unexpected interruptions, but it's wise to just handle them as they occur. Oddly enough, the distractions might inspire you to even greater heights."
pisces,2011-06-22,"A personal issue -- domestic or romantic -- may rattle your nerves today, yet you don't quite know how to settle yourself down. It's all too easy for you to shut out your problems for a while by withdrawing into your imagination. But escaping into Fantasyland works best for only brief moments of time, prior to returning to the real world issues. Working on tangible solutions is productive, though tensions may not ease until tomorrow."
aries,2011-06-23,"Although you are able to charge forward into the unknown, it would be wise to consider your options before you find yourself in over your head. Your usual way of overcoming fear is to jump into a situation as you feel the adrenaline building. However, the Moon's shift into your sign today allows you to be uncharacteristically sensitive, making you more aware of the potential problems ahead. You can quickly change your plans along the way, but a bit of forethought is still advised."
taurus,2011-06-23,"You could be so energetic today that you think you must hide your enthusiasm or you might upset the delicate balance that's holding everything together. However, denying your feelings will probably increase the intensity of what's happening, rather than alleviating it. It's true that a total lack of self-restraint may exacerbate a problem, but your response isn't limited to all or nothing. Be smart; revealing your emotions gradually will prevent others from being overwhelmed."
gemini,2011-06-23,"You Twins are quite capable of following two tracks at the same time. You want your friends to be open and honest as they tell you what they need from you today. But simultaneously, you are afraid that their words are hiding unexpressed feelings. You might even be tempted to act foolishly as you try to expose someone's hidden agenda. However, there's no reason to force anything now since the truth will become apparent without your panicky reaction."
cancer,2011-06-23,"You want others to see your courage in action today, motivating you to bury your feelings and push beyond your usual limitations. Your satisfaction is dependent on your public appearance, leading you to hide your anxiety so effectively that others think that you are fearless. But there's no need to trick anyone into believing that you're a superhero. Just quietly do your very best, and the results will speak for themselves."
leo,2011-06-23,"You are excited about all the possibilities for growth and adventure, yet you are also aware that you will have to make sacrifices to accomplish your goals. Thankfully, you're not concerned now about anything that could get in the way of your success. In fact, you might be so sure of yourself that you assume you'll be able to overcome obstacles as they appear. Be wise and improve your chances by planning carefully and following through methodically."
virgo,2011-06-23,"You face an uphill battle today as you try to figure out why your recent plan went wrong. You may be struggling to unravel the complex factors playing out in the present moment, but it's apparent that you must make a mid-course correction or you won't reach your destination. Nevertheless, it's not wise to make changes too quickly. Overreacting may be even less helpful than doing nothing. Don't look back to uncover your mistakes; instead, look ahead to prepare for where you are going."
libra,2011-06-23,"A relationship creates stress today as someone rebels against your plan. A close friend or partner might surprise you by expressing a position that is very different from yours. Although you may choose not to argue, just letting others do what they want isn't in your best interest. It's much smarter to directly confront small problems now so they won't grow into major ones later."
scorpio,2011-06-23,"You aren't satisfied by simply doing good work today; you want others to acknowledge your brilliance. Attacking an old project in a new and different way isn't enough to hide your insecurity. But there's no need to put so much effort into seeking recognition, especially if your desire for the spotlight allows you to forget that your initial purpose was to get the job done. Creating a detailed plan can be quite helpful, but too much analysis might get in the way of your productivity."
sagittarius,2011-06-23,"You are overly self-expressive today with the enterprising Aries Moon now moving through your 5th House of Spontaneity. However, your exuberant feelings of creativity may be too much for those around you. Being less demonstrative is not a sensible solution, but it helps to allow time for others to show off their talents, too. Encouraging friends and co-workers to embark on an adventure with you may be much more rewarding than just doing it by yourself."
capricorn,2011-06-23,"You may be stepping onto unfamiliar ground today as you struggle to balance your desire to engage someone you love and your need to withdraw into your own world. Fortunately, you can play both extremes now. Keep your heart open while also being mindful of setting your boundaries and respecting the needs of others. It doesn't matter if you're feeling a bit uncomfortable, because it's at these awkward spots that the real magic happens."
aquarius,2011-06-23,"You are an intense bundle of erratic thoughts today as familiar ideas combine to create ingenious plans. Luckily, you can showcase your talents without too much effort. However, there is a huge difference between an adequate job and an awesome one. Putting extra time into your preparation pays off now, so don't take any unnecessary shortcuts."
pisces,2011-06-23,It's scary to push forward so far that you must scramble your way back to safe ground. There's no need to throw out your sensible plans just because you momentarily forgot about them and then moved too fast. Risk-taking isn't necessary now; just slow down and stay on the current path. Don't let the increasing pressure trick you into reacting impulsively.
aries,2011-06-24,"Sometimes you get so excited about your dreams that you want to tell everyone about them. However, it may be wise to keep quiet today. There's nothing wrong with sharing what's on your mind or in your heart, but it's smart to wait for the best time. Keep in mind that others have things that they want to say, too. Practicing patience now strengthens your character and gives you the opportunity to be a supportive friend."
taurus,2011-06-24,"You may think that you know what you want today, but giant Jupiter increases your appetite and tempts you to share more than is needed. You might believe that you're just expressing your opinion, but others won't be able to hear your message if they think you're overstating your position. It's better to keep your communications to as few words as possible now. You'll have time later on to further expound on your ideas when the energy settles down."
gemini,2011-06-24,"Your friends and co-workers may seem a bit detached today, but they will probably support your current plans anyway. Nevertheless, you're not likely seeking comfort from them now; you want action. You would currently prefer someone to just do something, rather than idly talking about it. Plenty of words have already been spoken and it's time to move forward. Don't wait for anyone else to make the first move; lead by example, instead."
cancer,2011-06-24,"You are eager to show your boss and co-workers that you can take charge, for it seems like lately they have drawn a different conclusion. Remember, you don't really have to prove yourself to anyone. All you need to do is recognize what happens as you push beyond your self-doubt and do what needs to be done. Unfortunately, you are capable of being the biggest obstacle to your own success. Get out of your way and allow your intuition to guide you toward your future."
leo,2011-06-24,"It's tempting to plan ahead without acknowledging the details that might prevent you from being successful. On the other hand, it's unproductive to get so hung up in fine-tuning your strategy that you don't do anything at all. Initiating action now is healthier if you don't bolt ahead too fast. It's more important to sustain your efforts today than to do a whole lot of running around in circles."
virgo,2011-06-24,"You may be so eager to start something new today that you become anxious unless you're busy every moment. This uncharacteristic impatience may be your way of overcompensating for the current uncertainty. Talk with your friends about your discomfort. Acknowledging your desire to make progress helps to alleviate your stress, but nothing positive will be gained by ignoring your cautious approach to life."
libra,2011-06-24,"Even a straightforward interaction with a friend could feel like a disagreement today, but it's not that your desires are necessarily different. It's more likely that your approaches vary because of your individual creative styles. Instead of trying to agree on one way to accomplish your current goal, acknowledge the advantages of both plans. It's more effective now to be inclusive than to be right."
scorpio,2011-06-24,"You may be quick to anger with the Moon in hot-tempered Aries today, but you will probably try to keep your emotions in check. You would be wise to redirect your pent-up energy into your work. Or, you could step up your exercise program to help you release your stress. Although it's crucial to acknowledge your feelings, it's up to you to decide how to express them."
sagittarius,2011-06-24,"You might not be able to rationalize your optimism today, for your uplifting mood doesn't necessarily correspond to anything specific in your life at this time. Nevertheless, your thoughts have more power than usual, enabling you to use them to positively impact your future. Just be careful that you're not avoiding an issue that must be faced. Exerting control over your life is a smart idea as long as you aren't trying to escape from the truth."
capricorn,2011-06-24,"You may be caught up in the stress of the moment as you consider how much to share about your ambitions. You realize that talking about your intentions sometimes diminishes your motivation. Nevertheless, you still want those you trust to know what's important to you now. Pushing ahead without an explanation can be confusing to others, so take the time to make sure that your closest friends know exactly what you're doing."
aquarius,2011-06-24,"Although you can sense the pressure building, you may still be optimistic today as you try to keep up with the changing developments at work. But even if you're feeling fine, pay attention to any unexpressed negativity that might be lurking beneath the surface. Unfortunately, keeping secrets now will only add to your troubles later on. Think about taking someone into your confidence, because getting another perspective can help you see things in a new light."
pisces,2011-06-24,"Taking action can produce the impact that you want, but you first must convince yourself that you have waited long enough. You have your own inertia to overcome, and the longer you do nothing, the harder it is to finally get going. Your time is now; show everyone what you can do. Trust your intuition and don't let the present moment pass you by without making a concerted effort to get what you want."
aries,2011-06-25,"You're likely to step on someone's toes as mischievous Mercury aspects warrior Mars. You might not even realize that your behavior is reckless because the self-directed Aries Moon encourages you to act first and think about it later. Remember, an impulsive response can get you into trouble because your immediate reaction might be off the mark. Wait until next week to make any major decisions if you can."
taurus,2011-06-25,"You are able to anticipate the Moon's return to sensible Taurus later today, and you want to make the most of it. Opening your heart to your desires is a healthy strategy, but you may find it difficult to distinguish your attractions from what's absolutely critical. Make separate lists for your needs and your wants to help you prioritize what's in front of you."
gemini,2011-06-25,"You can't prevent the noisy words from buzzing in your ears today, even if they don't offer the hint of a solution. Messenger Mercury is hyped up from its aspect to angry red Mars, firing your thoughts into a stream of consciousness. But the emotionally turbulent waters morph into a gently meandering river later in the day. Although your sense of urgency might fade, your conviction won't. Don't put off making a big decision if you already know what you want."
cancer,2011-06-25,"You appear as if you are strong and silent today, so others may not realize how lost you're feeling. Your thoughts are running around in circles like a hamster on a wheel, making it difficult to reach a sensible conclusion about what's happening. Your strategy is to keep your insecurities quiet rather than acknowledging any confusion. Although you're correct in believing that you should only share your business concerns on a need-to-know basis, discussing your fears with a trusted friend can help you feel much better."
leo,2011-06-25,"Although you're pushing yourself to finish a big project, it looks like it might take a little longer than you first expected. You may be tempted to blame someone else for your delay, but the current obstacles are most likely in your way because of you. Listen to the wisdom of the universe and slow down your pace now while you can still solve the problem."
virgo,2011-06-25,"Try to accomplish a lot early in the day since you could become more lackadaisical with the way things are when the Moon enters your 9th House of Future Vision. Your accurate perceptions grow fuzzy, making it impossible to decide much of anything. You might think that waiting will help you understand things better. Although you would prefer to be more practical, the day may still hold a few surprises for you."
libra,2011-06-25,"You don't like being put on the spot, especially if it's on your own territory. You may not be able to express what you're feeling because you can see things from several points of view. The smartest response today is to take the course of least resistance. Luckily, you can make any performance a successful one. Keep your personal opinions private until you are absolutely sure of your final answer."
scorpio,2011-06-25,"You might exhaust yourself today as you run through a mental obstacle course over and over again. However, each time you try to handle the resistance in the same manner, you believe that your strategy will work. Unfortunately, you're wasting valuable resources by relying on old tactics. You may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome if you do something radically different now."
sagittarius,2011-06-25,"It feels as if you're running out of time so stop procrastinating, sort things out and initiate your new plan of action. Don't fret if there are still miscellaneous details to handle. You should be able to fill in more missing pieces as you move along with your strategy. However, it's important to take advantage of the combustible Aries Moon in your expressive 5th House before the energy mellows later this evening."
capricorn,2011-06-25,"You may be quite eager to get going today, but it's not yet time to jump the gun. Don't rush anything; you will intuitively know the exact moment when you should make your move. Keep in mind that your mental preparation is a key ingredient in creating success for your current  enterprise. You are being tested to determine if you can narrow your vision and concentrate solely on accomplishing your goals. Stay aware of your process and nudge yourself back on track if you're lured off course for any reason."
aquarius,2011-06-25,"You are able to connect with almost anyone today and, more importantly, you have lots of fun doing it. Unfortunately, you could also waste precious time doing things that are not critical to your goals. It's wise to rein yourself in early on or you could lose control of your schedule. Fewer distractions now make it easier to find the satisfaction and success that you seek."
pisces,2011-06-25,"You may be ready to move ahead with a collaborative project today, or you might try to create something special on your own. Luckily, you receive kudos for your current efforts and can gain enough recognition to make your new venture worthwhile. But exercise caution, nonetheless, for you could become so enamored with your own ideas that you cannot clearly judge the potential value of your plan."
aries,2011-06-26,"You might do something that upsets someone today because you're willing to gamble your security for the possibility of an amazing experience. You're more ready than ever to push the envelope of your reality. However, caution is advised because you won't likely get what you want unless you are willing to make a strategic plan first. Remember, what you do before you take action is as important as what you do after."
taurus,2011-06-26,"Chaotic Uranus can take you for a wild ride today, leading you to temporarily forget that you like things simple. You may feel ready to rock the boat and shake up your mellow routine. However, fulfilling fantasies shouldn't be your focus; what's really important is to free up your imagination so you can visualize the amazing possibilities that are outside of the box."
gemini,2011-06-26,"Your energy may be scattered today as you try to express yourself in new and different ways. Fortunately, you're able to bend the rules now or even make them up as you go. It's exhilarating when everything falls into place and goes according to your plan. Enjoy the fun while you can, but don't expect it to last. You'll need to return to reality and take care of unfulfilled obligations sooner or later."
cancer,2011-06-26,"Restless Uranus squares the Sun in your sign today, provoking you to come out of hiding. You aren't overly concerned about the consequences of your actions now because it feels as if you can get away with being yourself without others judging you. Although acting spontaneously is refreshing, you could still do something foolish if you don't consider how you might feel later. It's great to express yourself, but think before you act."
leo,2011-06-26,"You have big dreams about what you want to do for adventure, but it may not be that easy to turn your ideas into reality. Instead of procrastinating today, it's smarter to take the time now to create a concrete plan. It's a mistake to think that anything is possible unless you're willing to put in the effort required. Fortunately, you have more time than you think, so don't overreact and try to do everything at once."
virgo,2011-06-26,"You may feel as if you're under a lot of stress today, but your desire to do the right thing can turn a difficult day into a memorable one. Don't worry about how to get others to support your agenda. Instead, simply do the very best job you can, even if you must do it alone. Ultimately, your performance will exceed everyone else's expectations of what you should do."
libra,2011-06-26,"It's challenging to motivate yourself today, for you may feel unusually calm, even in the center of a storm. The unexpected chaos that's brewing around you only encourages you to hold fast to your current position. However, your immunity to change won't last; take preemptive action, rather than passively waiting for the lightning to strike."
scorpio,2011-06-26,"You need to be careful today or you could become so involved with a project that it takes over your entire day. Something that begins as a minor chore could grow more complicated as you mull over your options. A brilliant plan might come to you in a sudden flash of inspiration, tempting you to take immediate action. But impulsive behavior could demonstrate your recklessness rather than your intelligence. Be patient; the best ideas develop over time."
sagittarius,2011-06-26,"Your enthusiasm is high today, yet it's tough to know exactly what to do with your unconventional desires. Unfortunately, if you attempt to ignore your needs, they will only grow stronger. However, you could easily upset the stability of a comfortable relationship now if you just blurt out what you want. Choose an appropriate moment and discuss your feelings casually without becoming overly attached to what happens next."
capricorn,2011-06-26,"It isn't easy today to stick to your customary role of being the responsible one in your family or group of friends. You are suddenly eager to explore undiscovered facets of yourself. You are even tempted to take a quantum leap of faith and blast through a self-imposed limitation. Instead of shocking others with your uncharacteristic behavior, simply start by revealing your thoughts. Once you are ready, transform your brilliant ideas into positive action."
aquarius,2011-06-26,"You may be difficult to deal with today because you don't want to do what's expected of you. Your key planet, rebellious Uranus, squares the Sun in your 6th House of Daily Routines, prompting you to break the rules. However, you might try to hide your radical behavior now because you don't want to be rejected by those you love. Go ahead and take a risk; others won't judge you as harshly as you're judging yourself. Coloring outside of the lines is your best approach."
pisces,2011-06-26,"You are on edge today and even those things that usually seem comforting can provoke free-floating anxiety. You are being stretched tightly and something is ready to snap at the slightest little provocation. Unfortunately, you could feel even worse if you go over the edge and lose your temper. Discussing your fears rationally now is a better strategy than ignoring them, for they won't go away until the underlying issue is addressed."
aries,2011-06-27,"You know what you want, and you're willing to take a risk to achieve satisfaction. Fortunately, your key planet Mars supports your impulsive behavior today with a cooperative sextile to erratic Uranus. Go ahead and push up against the restrictions; they just might give way and let you pass. But don't expect everything to go smoothly; there still could be a few difficult bumps along the way."
taurus,2011-06-27,"The Moon's visit to your sign usually calms down your energy, but today you're feeling restless and reckless. You wish that there was a straightforward route to your destination, but your path to success could be a crooked one. Instead of attempting to hide your uncertainty with arrogant behavior, wait until your best option becomes more apparent."
gemini,2011-06-27,"You may feel as if you're at the top of your game today, empowering you to show off your charm and quick wit. However, you might be so clever at telling your tale that you step over the fine line that usually separates fact and fiction. Your ability to put a positive spin on things enables you to impress everyone now, including yourself. Nevertheless, it would be wise to stick to the truth right from the start."
cancer,2011-06-27,"People seem way too intense today and you aren't having much luck at calming them down. However, this isn't really about anyone else; it's about managing your discomfort that arises when someone else appears to be out of control. Your lesson now is to recognize that you're only responsible for your own emotions. Stay present with your feelings without putting up any unnecessary defenses in the process."
leo,2011-06-27,"It seems as if you should be getting ready for a showdown today, but you're not even sure why. Someone may be acting rather strangely now and something just isn't making sense. You might be tempted to express your frustration as anger, yet you don't really have a valid reason. Although you want to take action right away, be smart and let the situation unfold on its own until you have more information."
virgo,2011-06-27,"Your natural analytical skills won't be of much help because you're not willing to spend time thinking about your options today. You can see a number of different routes that could further your career goals, yet you just want to take the path of least resistance. Luckily, the most creative solutions will come to you now while you are in motion, so don't waste time sitting on the sidelines trying to logically decide your next move."
libra,2011-06-27,"Your day may be totally thrown off course by someone close to you doing something totally unexpected. Fortunately, what first seems like a setback or, at least a detour, could turn into a wonderful journey of discovery. However, you might miss out on an exciting little adventure if you try to resist the changes. Let your plans fall to the wayside and allow the unknown to pleasantly surprise you."
scorpio,2011-06-27,"You might become a bit frustrated today as irrepressible Mars in breezy Gemini scatters your energy. Although you prefer a deeper level of interaction, the current pace may be too hectic for the kind of communication you want. Don't push too hard or the intensity you desire will appear in the form of resistance from others. Keep up with the rapidly changing circumstances for now and they will settle into more meaningful exchanges by tomorrow."
sagittarius,2011-06-27,"You may be more overbearing today than you realize. In fact, you are so forceful now that your co-workers might think that you're being unreasonable. But your impulsive approach could produce quick results, so stick to your innovative plan even if it's unproven. Don't waste energy trying to convince others that your idea is a viable one. Ultimately, your success will speak volumes for you."
capricorn,2011-06-27,"You may be growing more certain that you're the only one who knows what's happening and what to do about it. Your confidence can promote a false sense of authority, encouraging you to act first and ask questions later. But an error in judgment is possible if you become stuck on your plan. Keep in mind that you're not the only one with a good idea; you will be much more successful if you incorporate multiple viewpoints into your perspective."
aquarius,2011-06-27,"Your strategy at work isn't obvious to others, so they may not understand what you're doing. The bottom line is that you don't see reality in the same light as your associates because your plan isn't bogged down in office politics or sentimental attachments. But you are able to be so objective that you might miss an important emotional component to your strategy. Nevertheless, don't worry about ruffling someone's feathers today; your brilliance shines through as long as you maintain your integrity."
pisces,2011-06-27,It's challenging to concentrate on your current job now because you may be trying to do too many things all at once. You could get dragged into an argument you cannot win if someone questions your ability to deliver on your promises. Don't try to justify your actions because your logic isn't as solid as you think. Your accomplishments will be your best defense as long as you remember to keep refocusing on your goals.
aries,2011-06-28,"It's a sign of intelligence when you want to grow into a more evolved person, but proving that you're right is not the best trajectory toward self-improvement. There's no justification for provoking a disagreement in order to demonstrate your competence. Instead of being argumentative at work or at home, show everyone how helpful you can be now. Cooperation is your smartest strategy today; it's certainly better than wasting energy in unnecessary conflict."
taurus,2011-06-28,"You may need to deal with a difficult person today and, luckily, you have the necessary skills to safely protect your boundaries. But winning a border skirmish isn't enough; you must also behave in a kind and supportive manner. Your apparent nemesis might not be a real adversary now, unless you force him or her into the role by escalating a disagreement into a fight to the finish."
gemini,2011-06-28,"You aren't interested in the complexity of a relationship now, but you also don't want to be by yourself. Ultimately, you're willing to have a heartfelt discussion with a close friend or loved one, but you prefer to keep the conversation as light as possible. Although sinking into your feelings reveals your discomfort with emotional vulnerability, it also brings a deeper sense of intimacy."
cancer,2011-06-28,"A disagreement over who's in charge can raise intense emotional issues that might provoke feelings of desperation today. Thankfully, you can tap into an inner power that enables you to transmute a negative feeling into a positive one. Searching for your personal truth will lead you back to your own center, but your revelations won't have much significance unless you find the courage to be vulnerable with your partner. Don't worry too much; sharing your heart is safer than you think."
leo,2011-06-28,"You're quick to snap today if a lingering issue remains unaddressed. Focusing on the people involved can turn the whole situation into a bigger deal than you intend. But don't try to suppress your feelings, for this isn't a useful strategy. If you hold back your emotions because you think it's safer to stay quiet, the unexpressed energy acts like a lightning rod. Wait for an appropriate moment to calmly share your concerns."
virgo,2011-06-28,"It's complicated to tell someone how you feel today, especially if you think that your disclosure might be a catalyst that triggers unpleasant memories. Nevertheless, you may not be able to settle down until you share what's in your heart with a trusted friend. Be careful; revealing your inner process might elicit a strong flow of tough emotions, but the lessons you could learn will make your journey worthwhile."
libra,2011-06-28,"You have to deliver on the promises you've made or others will judge you rather harshly today. You may be obsessive now about following through on your commitments, and might have to work extra hard to fulfill your responsibilities. Don't let anyone hook you with an emotional drama that isn't your concern. If you stay on track, you could accomplish all you set out to do, and even more."
scorpio,2011-06-28,"The Sun's opposition to your key planet Pluto might make you think that you have lost control of your schedule as everyone places additional demands on your time. Perhaps you want more independence today, but your everyday routine has become so complicated that you feel stuck. Trying to force a solution won't bring satisfaction and will probably just upset others. Stay aware of your feelings, but wait until the intensity settles a bit before you initiate action."
sagittarius,2011-06-28,"You might think that you know how to regain control over a messy situation, but you may be feeling uncharacteristically insecure. Don't overcompensate by pretending that everything is fine. Even if you would prefer to be having fun, these aren't carefree days. Focus on your most important tasks before doing anything else; you'll be able to relax a whole lot better once your work is done."
capricorn,2011-06-28,"No matter how tired you are today, almost nothing will prevent you from reaching your goals. You have an unending well of energy now, so keep plodding through your tasks. You have been blessed with an extra dose of practical determination. Even if you must fight to defend your beliefs, set your goals high and then do whatever it takes to achieve them."
aquarius,2011-06-28,"You need to be brutally honest with yourself today or you could face a dark night of the soul. Shine the light of awareness onto your fears as you re-evaluate old plans. Keep in mind that current events may challenge the usefulness of an agenda that has already served its purpose. Rather than rushing out to make a new list of things to do, spend your time now rethinking your goals."
pisces,2011-06-28,"You may be argumentative today because you are pushing back against the will of others. You might feel excluded from your workgroup, even if you are actually an integral part of the team. Although your inclination is to withdraw if something goes wrong, you can't run away from your current responsibilities. Your frustration can turn to anger, causing you to inadvertently ruffle some feathers. Nevertheless, peaceful coexistence is still better than outright conflict."
aries,2011-06-29,"You may be pumped up today, but you wish that someone else would pick up your positive attitude and run with it. You can grow tired of being the one who always gets things going. You could be ready to give up or you might decide to give it one more try. Although a complicating quincunx between pushy Mars and unrelenting Pluto makes it almost impossible to know what's best, trust your initial impulse and don't let doubt slow you down."
taurus,2011-06-29,"Although you normally have plenty of common sense, you might throw caution to the wind if someone appeals to your more adventurous side today. You may even begin a conversation with a friend about a topic that's usually off-limits. But don't hesitate just because you cannot tell where your discussion will lead. If there's a disagreement, it's not even necessary to reach a resolution now. No matter what happens, breaking the silence is a step in the right direction."
gemini,2011-06-29,"Impatient Mars is in your sign now, provoking you to take direct action, even if you don't have a plan in place. But its ill-adjusted aspect to powerful Pluto can play out like instant karma and may quickly punish you if you don't consider other people's feelings before rushing into something new. A little caution is advised or you could inadvertently offend someone, precipitating more drama than you want."
cancer,2011-06-29,"Don't let anyone bully you into promising more than you can deliver today, for your desire to help might convince you to take on someone else's troubles. Offering your assistance may be admirable, but the unrealistic expectations of others could leave you exhausted now without anything to show for your efforts. Remember, being compassionate is honorable, but you won't be able to save another person unless you save yourself first."
leo,2011-06-29,"You need to inform your friends about your position on a work-related issue today. You would be wise to explain yourself carefully because you want their support. But you're tired of having to tell your story one more time, so everyone is able to understand your next move. Remember, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition; consider your audience and readjust your message as needed."
virgo,2011-06-29,"Your actions may not be in full alignment with your intentions now. Although you have the words to explain what you're doing, you lack the finesse to execute your plan. One strategy is to share your perspective based upon your analytical thinking. But then, set aside logic and do what feels right in your heart."
libra,2011-06-29,"You would like to make your choice between two divergent positions today by finding a harmonious balance between the extremes. Although encouraging fair play is one of your strengths, it's challenging when one person is saying ""my way or the highway"" so insistently that there's no room to negotiate. You're not the sole arbiter of the current situation, so you may need to relinquish control. Have faith that things will unfold as they should."
scorpio,2011-06-29,"Your two key planets are warrior Mars and ruthless Pluto. These tough planets are in a difficult quincunx aspect today, requiring you to tone down your message. Manage your overall energy carefully, for not everyone has the ability to match your intensity. Your passionate nature is a blessing, but sometimes it can feel like a curse. There's no reason to be afraid of your own emotions; however, it's a good idea to respect the boundaries of those who are."
sagittarius,2011-06-29,"You may run out of patience today because you're eager to explore what is beneath the surface. It's particularly frustrating if you want to investigate a meaningful subject, yet others don't understand what you're talking about. Your friends probably have good intentions, but they aren't able to slow down enough to notice what's really important. If someone seems easily distracted, it's a sign for you to retreat. Instead of pushing for a soul connection now, relax your agenda and make room for intimacy to happen more organically later on."
capricorn,2011-06-29,"Everyone at work may get on your nerves because no one is doing what's expected of them. Expressing your anger, however, isn't enough today. Losing your temper doesn't motivate anyone to get on track, nor does it improve your attitude, either. Self-control is tricky business now, for unspoken emotions can have surprising consequences. Your wisest strategy is to tell your co-workers about your feelings without placing blame or expectations on them. Your disclosure clears the air and allows you to move on."
aquarius,2011-06-29,"You want to share what's in your heart today, but you might become hooked on your own words in the process. However, your ability to stay emotionally detached is a mixed blessing. It's fortunate that you are able to communicate objectively, but your actions may appear awkward. Ultimately, it's better to take extra time to acknowledge your feelings than to act them out unconsciously."
pisces,2011-06-29,"Establishing and maintaining clear boundaries is often difficult for you Fish, yet today it's even harder than usual. You can trick yourself into believing that your feelings are logical, but caution is advised. Impulsive behavior can take you to the edge of predictability. Slow down, even if your thinking is lightning fast."
aries,2011-06-30,"You may be panicking because you think that you're running out of time, but it's smarter to wait a day or two before taking any drastic measures. Don't overreact; it's not the best time to rush ahead and show everyone how well you can handle an emergency. There's no need to try to inspire others with your courage. Instead of mustering up false bravado, observe your emotions without trying to prove anything."
taurus,2011-06-30,"You probably have quite a lot to do, but others may not realize how busy you are today. You're not interested in being in the spotlight now, so working quietly behind the scenes suits your mood. However, it's not that you're purposefully trying to avoid recognition; you just don't want to waste energy seeking attention. There's nothing wrong with graciously accepting acknowledgement for your contribution."
gemini,2011-06-30,"Your moods are rapidly fluctuating today and every time you make up your mind something happens and your feelings shift again. You could be overly concerned with how others interpret your instability now, but you don't really have the ability to change their perceptions. Instead of trying to fix something that's beyond your control, concentrate on being true to your values. Wait to share your opinions until your emotions settle down."
cancer,2011-06-30,"The Moon's return to your sign today can fill you with pride or it can raise fears that you would prefer to avoid. Either way, be ready to go on a ride. It's best to handle your feelings as they arise or they will just get in the way of the next emotional cycle that starts after tomorrow's Solar Eclipse. Relinquish your expectations; maintaining an open mind will help to make everything flow smoother."
leo,2011-06-30,"It's okay to keep to yourself today, for you could benefit from some quiet time to listen to your heart. It can be challenging to hear your own voice if you're busy running around for everyone else. It's not your fault if people are pushing you to perform. Instead of feeling like a dancing bear in a circus, do what's best for you now. Others will probably forgive your current need for privacy once you show them what you accomplished."
virgo,2011-06-30,"You might confuse others with your scattered energy today and inadvertently draw them away from their chores. Although your intentions are good, you're not interested in setting the agenda for everyone else. But before you claim that you don't want the extra responsibility now, consider the practicalities involved in the trade-off. It may be smarter to negotiate for what you want than to just walk away from the situation."
libra,2011-06-30,"You might set yourself up for disappointment today because it seems like you're willing to take care of everyone at work. However, you shouldn't spread yourself too thin, even if you care about others a whole lot. Try weaving an invisible protective shell around you so you don't get pulled off track. You'll probably do fine in the long run, but your current feelings of scarcity can impede your progress. It may feel like a stretch to change your attitude, but you certainly have the power to do it."
scorpio,2011-06-30,"You must stay focused on the present moment instead of holding on to an old dream that gets in the way of your current happiness. If someone questions your life strategy today, avoid falling into the trap of feeling the need to defend your goals. However, keep in mind that clinging to your past or dreaming about the future doesn't leave you with much time for now."
sagittarius,2011-06-30,"It seems like everyone wants to spend time with you now because you know how to have fun while still remaining emotionally sensitive. However, you can avoid the hot seat today by redirecting the subject of a conversation away from you and onto a friend. Your cleverness may get you through the day, but don't set aside what you should be nurturing in your own heart."
capricorn,2011-06-30,"You don't like it when a friend or partner is holding out on you. You prefer others to be forthright and say what's on their minds; otherwise your imagination transforms the unknown into something worse than the simple truth. Unfortunately, your desire to know another person's feelings could drive your own emotions deeper into hiding. Relax your intense curiosity; an indirect approach may be the perfect catalyst to trigger a necessary conversation."
aquarius,2011-06-30,"Your desire for an intellectual discussion may be thwarted today as other people's feelings keep cycling back into the conversation. You might try to steer the topics away from nonfactual biases. But your attempts to modify the natural flow of the group process could anger someone, eliciting the very same emotional outbreak you wish to avoid. Instead, allow the dialogue to meander naturally without imposing your agenda."
pisces,2011-06-30,"If you believe that a co-worker is trying to take unfair advantage of you at work, your swift response today could catch him or her off guard. Sometimes you are more forgiving, but now you could overreact if you feel that you've been pushed too far. Don't be afraid of a power struggle; just keep in mind that your compassion is your most effective weapon."
aries,2011-07-01,"The resistance you face can stop you in your tracks today, but it's crucial that you don't give up on a good idea. If you initially miss the lesson you're being taught, slow down and listen carefully to what's being said. The obstacles are more easily handled once you accept that they are there for a reason. Ironically, it's less important to reach your destination now than it is to fine-tune your plans."
taurus,2011-07-01,"Although you probably have a very busy day ahead of you, it still may be hard to get going. Even after you begin your day's work, you're tempted to get by with doing less. But your energy builds and you'll be ready to overcome anything that stands in your path once you find your pace. Just remember that you're not the only one with an ambitious agenda. Getting the facts from another point of view can change your perspective and increase your options."
gemini,2011-07-01,"It's tempting to waste the day running around in circles just trying to keep up with everything. But you may not get anywhere unless you're willing to take some time for contemplation today. Be careful, for your current strategy should not be thought of as a retreat. You must stabilize the progress you already made because you could jeopardize your success if you continue to move too fast. Remember, reaching your goals is more like running a marathon than a sprint."
cancer,2011-07-01,"Today's Solar Eclipse can be a harbinger of an energetic shift within your family. You could bury your head in the sand and be totally surprised by what happens, or you can co-create your future by living the change you seek. Start by sitting down and writing a list of resolutions, as if it is New Year's Day. Focusing your intentions during the eclipse plants significant seeds of thought in your fertile imagination."
leo,2011-07-01,"Today's Solar Eclipse falls in your 12th House of Endings, revealing an unusual blending of two cycles, since the New Moon is like a fresh start. But beginning something new prior to completing old business can be problematic. Allow the current process to play out naturally or you might miss your chance. Your best bet is to stay aware of the interrelationship between what you are finishing and what you want to do next."
virgo,2011-07-01,"You may feel isolated today as the moody Cancer Eclipse shakes your 11th House of Community. At first, people that you usually count on are not as accessible as you wish. Fortunately, your true friends will come through just in time with the support that you need. Don't draw the wrong conclusions prematurely; give others the benefit of the doubt instead of assuming the worst."
libra,2011-07-01,"You feel the pressure to make a career move today as the Solar Eclipse activates your professional 10th house. But a minor family crisis may add stress to your day, especially if you're already not seeing eye to eye with another family member. You might not be happy about how someone tries to control the situation now, but you should heed the smart advice, rather than throwing out an idea just because it makes you uncomfortable."
scorpio,2011-07-01,"This caring New Moon Eclipse in softhearted Cancer helps you build emotional continuity, although it may come with a component of drama. You may be happy to know who you are and where you are heading. But your perspective can be so intense that you feel as if you must stand up for your beliefs. You need to tread extra carefully now, for you could inadvertently provoke a conflict by resorting to aggressive behavior. Try channeling your passion into physical activities instead."
sagittarius,2011-07-01,You might be a bit uncertain as today's Solar Eclipse evokes a sense of discomfort by pushing you to explore feelings that you would rather forget. Don't belittle a friend's melodrama by judging it as unimportant just so you don't have to get involved. Your willingness to partake in a meaningful dialogue may be just what's needed to take a relationship to a new level of intimacy.
capricorn,2011-07-01,"An overly emotional interaction with a friend or partner today reveals that he or she has more going on now than you previously thought. You can tell that there's a suppressed power issue in the background, but you don't know what to do about the imbalance. If you confront it head-on, you could make matters worse. But if you let it slide, you may end up contributing to the weird energy. The conversation might be awkward at first, but if you can talk about your uneasiness without blaming anyone else you will be able to make a positive difference."
aquarius,2011-07-01,"You don't think that you're harboring any resentments about your job, but it's still not easy to let go of an unresolved hurt. Fortunately, you have a pretty good grasp of the source of your current negativity and it's up to you now to clear the air. Be open to receiving helpful support from those who love you. Leaning on your friends and family gives you the strength to process your feelings and get on with the real work at hand."
pisces,2011-07-01,You can finally stand firmly on the ground again after an extended period of uncertainty. But things are not as they seem and your foundation might not be as strong as you once thought. Don't get hooked into overcompensating today; there's really no good reason to flaunt your confidence. Nothing is gained by setting up a competitive dynamic where others are threatened by your success. Softening your stance now helps to relieve tensions and bring harmony back into your relationships.
aries,2011-07-02,"Resentment can grow out of frustration if you can't figure out how to bring strong feelings out into the open. Your regular channels of communication may be blocked today, leading you to internalize your unexpressed feelings. But your inability to say what's on your mind has less to do with external circumstances than with your need to process a lesson that you have been trying to avoid. The obstacles won't seem so overwhelming if you are willing to face the truth."
taurus,2011-07-02,"Now that your life seems to be moving in a positive direction again, you aren't eager to have to slow down for any reason. Nevertheless, easing off the gas pedal is a smart idea because you could lose control if you're taking the curves too fast. Although you might try to keep up with all your current projects, circumstances could dictate otherwise. Be wise and practice some self-discipline before things get out of hand."
gemini,2011-07-02,"You cannot waste energy and get away with it today because you are under pressure to get a lot accomplished and there's very little margin for error. You don't have much of a choice; you must pay attention to taskmaster Saturn as it gives you a stern reality check. However, just listening to the message is not enough. Narrow your concentration so you can focus on the most critical matters first."
cancer,2011-07-02,"You may retreat from a social situation today because someone hurts your feelings, even if it's unintentional. You could take a setback so seriously that you just want to stay home and be by yourself. However, withdrawing is not the most intelligent strategy now. Instead of concentrating on your disappointment, figure out how to improve your productivity. If you are accomplishing what you set out to do, you're less likely to have time to be bothered by the inconsiderate actions of others."
leo,2011-07-02,"Although you may be the first one to say you want to have fun, it's not that easy to set aside your responsibilities in favor of pleasure. Usually, you can easily discuss the alternative plans before determining the best way to handle the current temptations. However, your tendency is to keep your misgivings secret today. Push up against your resistance and take a risk. Others won't judge you so quickly if you share what's on your mind with them."
virgo,2011-07-02,"You are determined to maintain your integrity now by doing exactly what you promise, but distractions and obstructions continue to alter your course. You may be excited to head in an unknown direction, but you are on a mission and every setback brings more frustration. You can gain a lot of strength by staying on your spiritual path, rather than wandering around aimlessly. Remember, you cannot reach your destination if you stop to explore every alternative along the way."
libra,2011-07-02,"It's not apparent where so much resistance is coming from now, but you could bump into stone walls no matter which way you turn. Even your friends that are normally helpful seem to be blocking your way today. Thankfully, you have a secret weapon that you can use to your advantage: your ability to wait. Patience, combined with unflappable determination, is your ticket through this difficult obstacle course."
scorpio,2011-07-02,"You are following a path that you have been down before. However, you discover that even paved highways have fallen into decay and are difficult to traverse. No matter that you were previously moving along smoothly, now every step is a small victory and you need to work hard to gain more ground. Today's progress may feel good but will probably leave you exhausted. Don't take on too much; it's better to do one job well than to do several things haphazardly."
sagittarius,2011-07-02,"You do what you can to put your best foot forward, even in light of discouraging news today. It isn't easy to overcome a setback just by changing your mind. There are other concerns about the people you love and your role in the community. You have a lot to think about now, but rest assured your perspective will be better tomorrow. Allow a couple of days for things to turn around before reassessing the situation."
capricorn,2011-07-02,"Your somber attitude may be misinterpreted today as incurable pessimism; however, you don't feel as negative as you appear. You understand exactly what's required to reach your goals and are willing to do whatever you must to deliver on your promises. However, others may express their doubts now, but don't let them talk you out of your beliefs. Approach the future with a realistic outlook to prevent unnecessary disappointment later on."
aquarius,2011-07-02,"The connection between your current inability to express yourself freely and others holding you back might be more challenging than you think. In fact, your creativity may be squelched by Saturn's square to the Sun. Be careful; don't jump to conclusions today or you could waste a lot of energy incorrectly blaming others for your dilemma. Taking total responsibility for your own actions is a healthy place to start."
pisces,2011-07-02,"It doesn't feel good if a friend suddenly withdraws his or her support today. The cold shoulder you are receiving doesn't seem to be an appropriate response to your hard work, leaving you feeling angry and confused. Don't waste time or energy complaining; instead, take the high road and finish what you started. The more you stay focused now, the easier it will be next week when the challenging Sun-Saturn alignment begins to fade."
aries,2011-07-03,"You may feel lucky today and appear capable of turning nearly any situation into a good time. You don't even have to do anything special; just showing up seems to make others smile. The biggest danger now can come from being overconfident since your positive attitude is not able to cure everything. Acknowledging your limitations upfront can prevent that embarrassing moment when you might have to admit that you're really human, after all."
taurus,2011-07-03,"You prefer to keep your life simple yet you don't want to give up on your long-term goals. Unfortunately, you could exhaust yourself attempting to resolve your conflict about which path you should be following. You really don't like being pulled simultaneously in different directions, because it makes it tough to go along with the flow. Standing back from your dilemma enables you to find a solution."
gemini,2011-07-03,"There is an uneasy dynamic between your anticipation of what's next and your desire to hold on to the past. You could be moving faster than ever, but still cannot keep up with all the changes in your life. Nonetheless, even if you're a bit overwhelmed, you might be okay with the uncertainty. Retreating from your hectic schedule is a wise strategy; you'll be more effective if you wait a few days before pushing your agenda ahead again."
cancer,2011-07-03,"You may be experiencing the proverbial calm before the storm today, yet your fear of what could happen next might be more ominous than anything happening in your immediate future. This weekend can be a turning point, and your recent efforts should finally start to bear fruit. Be practical and prepare for the next round of change that is on the horizon."
leo,2011-07-03,"Your life becomes more complicated because you're able to see the truth today, even if someone is trying to hide it from you. Your intuition makes it nearly impossible for you to be involved in superficial interactions now. You're not interested in what others think of your ideas; they aren't up for negotiation. But there's no need to act self-righteously since it's easier to get along with your friends if you acknowledge that there are many ways to look at a situation."
virgo,2011-07-03,"Acting brilliantly may be a lot simpler than you think today. Even if you can feel the pressure, there's no need to jump through hoops to demonstrate your reliability. All you're required to do now is to show up with your common sense intact. Let your intelligence shine through, but don't try to solve every little problem that pops up."
libra,2011-07-03,"Although you might not have reached your destination yet, you are, nonetheless, at the end of a road. Your current position is challenging because your sense of falling short may leave you feeling frustrated today. Thankfully, you can ease the tension by simply shifting your perspective. The emotional landscape has already started to change, yet there will be plenty of time to reach your goals once the path in front of you clears again."
scorpio,2011-07-03,"You have run out of patience when it comes to anything that isn't already on your radar today. However, you still might become distracted if something interesting catches your eye. You could be annoyed with yourself if you succumb to following your whim instead of your schedule. Paradoxically, if you keep yourself on track, you still might wonder what you missed. In the long run, it's more important to keep moving forward than wasting time worrying about which route to choose."
sagittarius,2011-07-03,"The fiery Leo Moon increases your vitality today, but having more stamina doesn't mean that you're invincible. Although you might believe that you have an inexhaustible energy supply, it's not smart to take on more than you should. Unfortunately, looking to others won't produce the clarity you seek; you'll have to make decisions about what you can and cannot do on your own. If you overextend now, you'll likely run into problems next week. Save your strength for next week when you will need it."
capricorn,2011-07-03,"Today you may be expected to manage a complex issue that involves a financial transaction, or you might just be feeling pressure from the lack of clarity in a business relationship. Either way, resolution will probably be delayed because you need more information. Nevertheless, you are enticed to make a decision before your time runs out. Don't make an impulsive choice just because everyone thinks you should have already made up your mind. Wait until next week when you have more data at your disposal."
aquarius,2011-07-03,"A friend expresses feelings that catch you off guard, complicating your relationship more than you want. You prefer keeping everything casual and on a rational basis because the energy is simpler to handle. But you can't go back to the way things were unless you take a path of denial. Unfortunately, avoiding issues only makes them more difficult to handle. You can try downplaying the drama, but actively engaging in a constructive dialogue should help to reduce the complexity."
pisces,2011-07-03,"It's challenging to distinguish the separate threads of truth now, for they have already been woven with a believable blend of fact and fiction. This complex tapestry entangles your imagination if you overanalyze the situation. Be careful, for your false sense of accuracy can trick you into making a decision based on an incorrect assumption. Instead of forcing the issue, just appreciate the moment. It should be easier to sort yourself out in a few days."
aries,2011-07-04,"You might not have the relaxing day that you hoped for today because your mind is working overtime as you imagine all of the possibilities in front of you. However, you're likely to experience disappointment if your expectations are not grounded in reality. Instead of judging yourself harshly for falling short of your ideal fantasies, just observe your reactions to whatever happens. The current lessons are not about change; they are about acceptance."
taurus,2011-07-04,"Your key planet Venus widens your palette of desires as imaginative Neptune tempts you like a carrot on a stick. But this persuasive pull is countered by an exciting intellectual theme that won't let you escape into your dreams. Once you acknowledge that the simpler days of your past won't return, you'll be able to find pleasure in the exquisite complexity of the current moment."
gemini,2011-07-04,"Shocking Uranus illuminates your planetary ruler Mercury today, lighting up your mind like a flashbulb. Although you might not be able to contain your excitement, you may be fearful of others thinking you're weird. Your brilliant ideas may be unconventional, but they're good enough to share. Take a risk and reveal a quirky secret to someone you trust; you may be pleasantly surprised by the outcome."
cancer,2011-07-04,"Although it feels as if you're in touch with a higher intelligence today, it may turn out to be your own. However, if you believe that spirit guides or angels can communicate from other dimensions, you could be downloading instructions from a parallel universe. Trust your intuition now without overanalyzing the messages you receive or questioning the source."
leo,2011-07-04,"You want to look like you have your life under control, even if you know better. Thankfully, you are clever enough now to perform well when facing a difficult situation. But don't pretend that you have all the answers if you don't, because deceitful behavior could turn a minor drama into a major crisis. Your best strategy is to maintain an open mind and be flexible to learning what the moment has to teach you."
virgo,2011-07-04,Your ruling planet Mercury can stir up some fun today if you can suspend your need to have everything just right. Your brain is now processing information so quickly that your words can't keep up with your thoughts. Don't waste too much time explaining yourself; just enjoy the intellectual ride while it lasts. There will be time enough later to express your ideas in greater detail once you've gained a more objective perspective.
libra,2011-07-04,"Although social responsibilities may require your attention today, you're able to find pleasure in hosting a party or just making others feel at ease. Your ruling planet Venus receives a magical boost from imaginative Neptune, enabling you to enjoy the fruits of your personal creativity. However, stimulating dialogue is important now, too, so reach out to your friends and family. Conversations may bounce all over the place, but talking about your dreams will ultimately be more memorable than you expect."
scorpio,2011-07-04,"You may feel exhilarated because visions come and go so easily today. Although this free association seems wonderful at first, you might grow frustrated as you try to reach a conclusion. Each time you concentrate on one idea you're distracted by yet another series of fascinating thoughts. There's no need to control your mental meanderings now. Just go along for the ride; being practical will come more naturally tomorrow."
sagittarius,2011-07-04,"You make it look easy as you juggle a lot of tasks today, but you're probably working harder than anyone realizes. Fortunately, you can enjoy yourself when you are concentrating on your actions. However, if you lose focus, you'll quickly scatter your energy and won't have much to show for your efforts. It's better to do one thing well now than to start several projects and leave all of them unfinished."
capricorn,2011-07-04,"You can comfortably demonstrate your competence today without too much effort on your part. It's almost as if you are magically able to think about something and then make it happen. Unfortunately, you could get so lost in your fantasies that you forget to take any action at all. Ultimately, your ideas are worthwhile and your follow-through is good, but you still have to take the first step or you'll never manifest your dreams."
aquarius,2011-07-04,"Although you may be a rugged individualist, your current desire to display your independent streak can be an obstacle to your happiness. Fortunately, your friends are willing to cut you some slack today and allow you to check in and out of planned activities as you please. Just don't abuse your privilege. Even if your peers acknowledge that you're a non-conformist, it's wise to go out of your way and cooperate with others."
pisces,2011-07-04,"It's visiting day in Fantasyland and you've been given a personal invitation. However, no one else needs to know that you're escaping because you can transport yourself instantaneously in your imagination and return as quickly to reality for conversations with friends or family members. There's no need to explain your double life since you get to come and go as needed. Fortunately, this dance between two worlds allows you to join in the fun at home while still indulging in your daydream of choice."
aries,2011-07-05,"You are tempted to turn every little insignificant idea into a world of unlimited potential. You can, as William Blake wrote, ""see infinity in a grain of sand."" But reaching for the stars doesn't mean that you will actually reach them. Nevertheless, just extending yourself beyond your normal limits can create opportunities that will lead you to a more fulfilling life."
taurus,2011-07-05,"No matter what you do to keep yourself on task today, you might not be able to resist an offer that sounds better than it is. Thankfully, you also need some personal space now, so you might be able to maintain a bit of distance between you and someone who entices you with a good idea. Don't withdraw completely; just stay aware of what could happen if you leave your work undone."
gemini,2011-07-05,"Your key planet Mercury has you on a mental tilt-a-whirl today and it can be tricky to keep your bearings. Riding a wave of enthusiasm is fun, but you also have serious business to attend to now. Fortunately, your analytical powers are strong if you can remember to balance pleasure with practicality. But don't try to take any shortcuts; managing your time wisely will pay off in the long run."
cancer,2011-07-05,"You may feel stuck if your emotions aren't in harmony with your experiences today, and your growing impatience provokes you to justify your impulsive actions. Your highly opinionated manner and apparent self-confidence might be a way to hide your fear, but you could take things too far if you're not careful. Take a deep breath and bring yourself back to your center before your unsubstantiated facts land you in a pile of trouble."
leo,2011-07-05,"Your dilemma today stems from needing to find a healthy balance between overly cautious planning and acting recklessly. Thankfully, your organizational skills are operating efficiently today, enabling you to handle a lot of information. Nevertheless, pay attention to the practical constraints on your time and energy. You can be a star if you practice some self-discipline before you're overcommitted."
virgo,2011-07-05,"Your approach to others can be very outgoing today, yet you would prefer to show more self-restraint. But the Moon in your sign could make you overly talkative, especially with perceptive Mercury in the spotlight. Don't squander your mental resources; using words sparingly will give them extra impact. Remember, rambling on endlessly about your latest idea is not the best way to accomplish your goals. Do more and say less."
libra,2011-07-05,"You are clear about your current responsibilities, but you don't necessarily want to follow through on them. Part of your problem now is that you might think everything should be easier than it really is. Believing that you'll magically find a shortcut through the hard work could lead you to waste time looking for a quick fix. Conserve your energy for doing what's actually necessary to get to the finish line."
scorpio,2011-07-05,"Stay away from philosophical or political debates today because you could actually be arguing with yourself, and not with anyone else. At times it might even be difficult to tell which side you're on. However, you're not really flip-flopping on the issues; it's just that you can see multiple solutions that are sensible. Nevertheless, it's better now to wait before committing to any one position."
sagittarius,2011-07-05,"You have a lot to do today because busy Mercury activates your key planet Jupiter in your 6th House of Work. Although it's crucial to make positive changes in your daily routine, it's not helpful to turn your whole world upside down. It can be tricky because it's so easy for you to be distracted now by almost anything. Keep in mind that managing what's on your plate currently is more important than dreaming about the future."
capricorn,2011-07-05,"You're often the champion of organization and planning because you can maintain a healthy perspective under pressure. Typically, you are able to calculate what needs to be done to achieve your goals. Today, however, your reality filter may be a bit off as everything seems to have greater potential than it actually does, so it's wise to avoid making impulsive decisions. Thankfully, a bit of consideration goes a long way, so think twice and give your answer once, after your common sense returns."
aquarius,2011-07-05,"You could set up a friend for disappointment today if you don't establish limits on how much you're willing to help. Your mind is racing and you're tempted to agree to nearly anything just to quiet your worry. Unfortunately, this kind of logic won't really solve the problem. Instead of taking the easy way out and then being unable to fulfill your promises, say what you're truly feeling. The real answers now won't likely be rational because they will come from your heart."
pisces,2011-07-05,"Your schedule may be overbooked today and this might turn into a real problem. Only one appointment needs to run late and your whole day could fall apart. Instead of setting yourself up for a disaster, take a more flexible approach. Something as simple as leaving extra time between events may be enough to prevent a major mess later on."
aries,2011-07-06,"Although this has been a high-intensity week, you're ready to settle down and get some work done as your key planet Mars is motivated by taskmaster Saturn. Thankfully, the discriminating Virgo Moon helps you limit unnecessary activities. Rather than wasting time and scattering your energy, focus on the variety of things you have to do now. Even if it's difficult for you to commit to a schedule, today it is required."
taurus,2011-07-06,"You may breathe a sigh of relief now that the Moon is in fellow Earth sign Virgo. A familiar wave of practicality washes away the heightened intensity of the past few days. But this is no time to get lazy, for there is still so much to do. Fortunately, your actions seem to be on target today, enabling you to accomplish what must be done."
gemini,2011-07-06,"You are pulled in several directions as you sort out the most productive way to move through your busy day. Although you're eager for experiences that pique your curiosity, you don't have enough time to take everything in. You may be quite talkative and wish that you could interact with nearly everyone you meet, but you must make tough choices and limit your activities. Finding balance isn't easy, yet thinking carefully about your decisions before you make them assures the best possible outcome."
cancer,2011-07-06,"Others may not be able to see past your hard-working exterior today, but your emotions are running strong and deep. You'll feel better once you take a few deep breaths and give yourself some time to contemplate what works best for you. Otherwise, you'll just get swept up into doing what's expected, even if it means hiding what's truly important to you now. If anyone pressures you to do anything that's outside of your comfort zone, set clear boundaries before things become more complicated."
leo,2011-07-06,"A melodrama is beginning to fade while your common sense grows stronger by the hour. You have no interest in being waylaid by anyone's emotionally intense story today, especially one that appears to go nowhere useful. Instead, apply your efforts toward making your day more efficient. Work hard, but once you meet your obligations, choose rest over frivolous activities. Conserving your energy is wise because it will take you longer than a day or two to finish your project."
virgo,2011-07-06,"The Moon's visit to your sign is a strong reminder today that efficiently managing your internal world is a necessary part of putting your external affairs in order. Today's attitude sets the stage for what's ahead and if you let yourself become overwhelmed, things will only get harder to handle as the days fly by. But positive thinking isn't enough; hard work is your most reliable tactic to achieve success."
libra,2011-07-06,"You aren't eager to reveal your innermost feelings today, but thankfully others might not even notice that you're hiding something. It isn't that you have big dark secrets; you're just trying to prevent your relationships from growing more complicated. Consider the potential impact of what you do prior to taking action. Practicing a bit of self-restraint now is easier than dealing with the negative consequences afterward."
scorpio,2011-07-06,"Your friends may be overly critical about your work today as the Moon finishes up her stay in your social 11th house. Fortunately, you are self-assured now, enabling you to use the valuable feedback you receive without getting discouraged by anyone else's judgments. Utilizing your common sense helps you avoid taking any comments too personally."
sagittarius,2011-07-06,"You want everyone to accept your authority today as the Moon moves through your 10th House of Public Status. However, it isn't enough to be right; you also want others to appreciate you for your intelligence and your competence. Still, it's tempting to get sidetracked by big ideas, so keep your plans simple and then do your best to make them real."
capricorn,2011-07-06,"Ironically, it's easier to have fun today if you also have responsibilities that demand your attention. Even if you cannot act on the spur of the moment to join others in a playful activity, you can include time for socializing into your schedule. As paradoxical as it sounds, establishing an agenda allows you to be more spontaneous."
aquarius,2011-07-06,"It's challenging to focus on your work today when you have so much self-analysis going on in your own mind. You are smart to channel your internal noise into creative pursuits, rather than just wasting your energy. Don't be concerned if others think you are too serious now. You have pressing matters to handle that don't leave you with a lot of time to engage in social niceties. Your actions will speak for you, instead."
pisces,2011-07-06,"Although you may want to do things your own way today, you'll get along better with everyone if you respect the perspectives of others. Don't get so wrapped up in your own work that you cannot be sensitive to someone else. But there's no reason to set aside your own needs in deference to the preferences of your workmates. Finding common ground enables you to do your own thing while still following the rules of the game."
aries,2011-07-07,"You need an emotionally neutral setting so you can tell those closest to you how you feel today. Although you claim that you want calm and tranquil interactions, you're also longing for a bit of excitement. You might not be worried by what others think of your choices because you believe that nothing can get in your way now. Unfortunately, you may inadvertently overstep someone's limits. Displaying a little humility now can help you achieve personal satisfaction."
taurus,2011-07-07,"Your ruling planet Venus may bring sweetness into your life today in a way that is fresh and different. However, the opportunity you have for pleasure comes at a high price now. Keep in mind that your desire for simplicity means that you may have to set aside previous priorities. But don't bother trying to get approval from a friend, unless you're seeking to deepen that particular relationship. Remember, communicating your feelings isn't all fun and games; it takes hard work and an open heart."
gemini,2011-07-07,"You may believe that you should be discreet today because you assume that your quirky tastes will appear odd to those around you. It's true that others might judge you harshly because your current preferences seem weird in comparison to theirs. However, they might also envy you and wonder how you created the life that you're living. Don't slip too far away from social conventions. You have to follow the rules just like everyone else."
cancer,2011-07-07,"You could turn out to be your own biggest enemy today, especially if you're trying to calm your concerns about your emotional security. You long for the safety of a nurturing relationship, yet you may grow restless with a new situation. Even if you want to break out of your restrictive emotional bonds, balance your desire for excitement in the moment with the stability that you ultimately need."
leo,2011-07-07,"You may think that you know what's best today and you're willing to discard your old agenda if the right temptation comes your way. Unfortunately, your friends are not helping the situation by encouraging you to join them on their next adventure. Nevertheless, you need some playtime and may say yes if the invitation arrives when you are ready to escape. Just remember that your work will still be waiting for you when you return."
virgo,2011-07-07,"Your friends or co-workers might surprise you today with their resistance to going along with a previously agreed upon plan. You may feel as if there is a mutiny in progress, but the plot is more likely a cry for freedom than a play for power. It's futile to restrain the free flow of ideas. Even if a conversation makes you uneasy, you'll probably feel better once everyone's concerns are out in the open."
libra,2011-07-07,"Your plans are pulling you in different directions now, yet you realize you cannot take both paths. You're not yet ready to close one of the doors in favor of another. Although you wish you were able to postpone your decision permanently, today's events can solidify your thinking. Unfortunately, there are others directly impacted by your decision, and you cannot control everyone else's reactions. Even if you are ambivalent, it's wiser to just make a choice and then move on."
scorpio,2011-07-07,"Your feelings are growing stronger, yet this can make sharing them more complicated than ever. You can easily talk yourself into keeping your desires to yourself now because you're fearful of other peoples' reactions to your intense passion. Or, you might believe that your inner process isn't anyone else's business. Although you have sensible concerns, you would be smarter to take a risk and show your vulnerability."
sagittarius,2011-07-07,"Your key planet Jupiter is naturally optimistic and today's trine to intense Pluto can lead you to take your confidence too far. But looking good is easier today than feeling good. Although you aren't purposefully faking your good mood, you're still only revealing part of your story. Be aware of your tendency to hide your emotions because expressing them could be the catalyst you need to change an old behavior pattern."
capricorn,2011-07-07,"It's rather unsettling if you're attracted to the exact same instability today that you typically try to avoid. But you may be totally fascinated by someone's unorthodox style or radical ideas, even if you cannot see any practical value in it. Your unusual behavior might worry you, but don't hold yourself back. Rest assured that your more traditional approach to life will return in a couple of days."
aquarius,2011-07-07,"Your key planet Uranus can often be emotionally detached, but today it brings a sudden awakening of attraction and desire as it squares aesthetically pleasing Venus. But you're not drawn to the same old things; instead, do something that pulls you into new territory. For now, the crazier your idea, the more satisfaction you can derive from acting on it."
pisces,2011-07-07,"You reserve the right to be different today as spacey Uranus activates beautiful Venus in your 5th House of Romance. You aren't interested in being just like everyone else, so show off the twinkle in your eyes and enjoy the bounce in your step. Don't be afraid to move to the rhythm of music that no one but you can hear."
aries,2011-07-08,"Although you are eager to love, you may be too quick to fix whatever is wrong today. Your desire to make everything okay can lead you to miss the best part of a relationship. Rather than immediately taking control, it's healthier to open your heart as wide as you can and simply feel what's happening -- without doing anything at all. Naturally, you want to show others that you care, but you could create more intimacy now by revealing your vulnerability."
taurus,2011-07-08,"It's not easy for you to share your feelings today, since your needs could get lost in all the busyness of the day if you don't make time to connect with someone at work. Keep in mind that the most important communication probably won't be written or spoken. Your true message will emanate lovingly from your heart without any expectations. If you can avoid making demands on others, they will be more likely to give you their love and appreciation on their own accord."
gemini,2011-07-08,"Ironically, the smartest way to acknowledge the significance of a current relationship today is to withdraw a little to give the other person some space. This is not the best day to present your demands or to assume that you know what's ahead. Steer clear of any unnecessary confrontations over who is the boss. Just accept others for who they are and be secure in your own position. Save the heavy processing for another day when the atmosphere is more conducive to constructive dialogue."
cancer,2011-07-08,"Sexy Venus in your sign naturally amplifies your desires, but her opposition to passionate Pluto makes it more difficult to share your feelings. You might believe that you're trapped and that you won't be able to find a path to satisfaction. However, this is not the time to give up. Take a risk and share your needs with someone you trust, but don't blame anyone else for your current predicament. Obstacles won't seem so overwhelming if you speak directly from your heart and take full responsibility for your emotions."
leo,2011-07-08,"You may appear bright and cheery to others, yet there could be a challenging story that's hiding behind your friendly smile. You think that you're doing the right thing by sharing positive vibes, rather than spreading discouragement or anger. However, you pay a price for withholding what's important to you, and your suppressed negativity might just find a way to circle around and kick you from behind. Seek healthy ways to express your truth, so you can shine even brighter than before."
virgo,2011-07-08,"You don't like feeling coerced to express a certain point of view today. Your impulse probably isn't to fight back, but to resist passively by keeping your thoughts to yourself. Be careful; if you bend under pressure and act in a politically expedient manner, you'll feel the weight of the circumstances lean on you harder. But you can be strong now and support those who need it, while still going on the record with your own point of view."
libra,2011-07-08,"Your sense of power is not derived from anything you do today; actually, it's more dependent on what you don't do. You can make your point most effectively now by withdrawing your support from someone and simply focusing your efforts somewhere else. An open confrontation won't bring resolution, so avoid going to emotional extremes until you can regain your objectivity."
scorpio,2011-07-08,"You may be feeling pressured by an emotional conflict that has been hovering dangerously at the edge of eruption. But don't get hooked by someone else's issues. Remember that your jealousy or envy is likely based on your habitual insecurities and fears. You can overcome the immediate threat by being grateful for the abundance of blessings in your life, instead of worrying that there's not enough for you to get what you want."
sagittarius,2011-07-08,"You might stay in perpetual motion today to avoid an uncomfortable issue. But it's not a sensible strategy to distract yourself so you don't have to admit that something is out of balance in your life. You would be wise to take a bit of quiet time to reconnect with your inner world, even if your schedule is very busy. Once you get in touch with yourself, share your feelings with someone you trust. Your disclosure may be exactly the catalyst you need now to break out of a rut."
capricorn,2011-07-08,"A close relationship can be a source of worry today, especially if the balance of power isn't just right. You don't want to be controlled by someone else's agenda. Even if you're the one who is making the rules, a lack of equality can destabilize a partnership. Don't make assumptions now about who is in charge; talking it out can help to bring things back into harmony."
aquarius,2011-07-08,"You may see the weekend ahead as a chance to retreat. But your spiritual quest might need to be put on hold as you grapple with the complexity of a relationship that has grown overly intense. Nevertheless, allowing for some cooling off time could be wiser than pushing your way into an emotional mess that won't be easy to manage. But this dilemma is not about avoiding crucial issues; rather, it's all about finding your own center."
pisces,2011-07-08,"Strong passions may blast up to the surface, transforming a casual interaction into an intense emotional battlefield. Or, your profound feelings could lure you into an intricate dance with someone you love. In either case, this isn't a lighthearted time. Fortunately, you can assure a more positive outcome for everyone involved by changing the rules of the game and making it non-competitive."
aries,2011-07-09,"Your impulsive reactions may create unnecessary trouble today, especially if you don't acknowledge someone's existing boundaries. There are times when it's acceptable to push back against another person's resistance, but it must be done in a thoughtful manner. Stop to consider if you may be stepping out of line. A healthy relationship depends upon your ability to respect your partner's needs for personal space."
taurus,2011-07-09,"You may be quite optimistic today because your ruling planet Venus receives a positive attitude adjustment from joyful Jupiter. But anyone who actually takes the time to communicate with you quickly realizes that you've given serious thought to your current position. Others may be surprised by how practical your analysis is now. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to step through your plan one more time prior to taking action."
gemini,2011-07-09,"Reality comes back into focus slowly today, and it could take a few more days before your feet are both on the ground again. Nevertheless, you are tempted to milk an opportunity for all it can offer. There's nothing wrong with trying to make a special moment last longer, but it's also wise to pay attention to the cues you receive from others. Balancing your current desire to have fun with following a more serious agenda will give you the best of both worlds."
cancer,2011-07-09,"Your immediate environment feels more spacious today, giving you enough room to contemplate your feelings without judgmental restrictions by others. But this current openness may be daunting if you decide to share your thoughts, because you might not be able to figure out when to stop. Thankfully, you can use your common sense to balance your need for connection with your desire to be alone."
leo,2011-07-09,"Although you may believe that you're being adaptable, you're more fixed than you realize today. Unfortunately, sticking to your original agenda might bring more frustration than happiness, especially if you pass up an interesting opportunity because of your lack of flexibility. Ultimately, it's about trusting the process; letting go of control could turn an uncomfortable situation into a positive one."
virgo,2011-07-09,"You are happily surprised by the easy flow of feelings today, but you might feel challenged to maintain a cool analytical approach to your goals. Your subjectivity may have more impact than you wish, leading you to compensate by retreating into the safety of your logic. Although you are probably more comfortable trusting your thoughts rather than your emotions, shielding yourself from the uncertainties of your desires can also lessen the joy they bring."
libra,2011-07-09,"Your ruling planet Venus receives a boost from jolly Jupiter now, lifting your spirits higher and higher. Although you want to be indulged by someone you like, there may be a reason why you won't allow yourself to let loose and have fun. As crucial as it is to live up to your promises and fulfill your responsibilities, it's also important to recognize that you will have more to offer others in the long run if you take some time to enjoy yourself today."
scorpio,2011-07-09,"The Moon's return to your sign brings wide mood swings, and you aren't sure whether to feel happy or sad because each new opportunity also presents a serious obstacle. Fortunately, you should be able to work within the limits of nearly any situation now, as long as you don't greedily expect something for nothing. Be willing to do the serious thinking, detailed planning and heavy lifting required to make the most of the present moment."
sagittarius,2011-07-09,"Much of what's happening for you is hidden from others now, although they may think they know what you are experiencing. Fortunately, you realize that it's wise to keep some of your feelings quiet, even though buoyant Jupiter helps you put on a great show of love and support. Don't feel responsible to explain your thoughts to anyone today; it will be easier to discuss your secret worries next week."
capricorn,2011-07-09,"You aren't happy about dealing with someone if you know that he or she isn't being honest with you. You intuitively sense when others are hiding their feelings, but you can't confront them now or they'll get defensive and slip deeper into denial. Your lesson now is to learn how to live with uncertainty. You won't likely hear the rest of the story for a few days, so be patient and take comfort in knowing that you will discover the truth in time."
aquarius,2011-07-09,"You like the positive vibes coming your way today because it feels as if others are encouraging you to be yourself. However, you can't put your finger on something that doesn't feel quite right. Unfortunately, you only grow more frustrated as you struggle to discover what you don't know -- especially because you actually might not be missing anything at all. There's nothing you need to do now; your weird sense of uncertainty will pass. In the meantime, accept the support that you receive with humility and grace."
pisces,2011-07-09,"You are in a smooth emotional flow today, but you aren't sure where the currents are heading. Thankfully, your destination isn't what's important; what matters is that you stay as open as possible so you can fully experience each moment. But this isn't about escaping from responsibilities, for you still must fulfill your obligations. Don't overanalyze what's happening; your primary job now is to stay in touch with what's in your heart."
aries,2011-07-10,"It's challenging to remain present if your emotions raise issues that you want to avoid. You're ready to swing into action today so you can sidestep a troublesome topic before it even comes up. Admit your vulnerability, instead of pretending that your infinite powers can overcome any awkward situation. Facing your very human limitations can solidify a new friendship or deepen an existing intimate relationship."
taurus,2011-07-10,"You may suddenly realize that your involvement in a discussion won't be of much help today. You're eager to assist someone through a sticky situation, but it's healthy to recognize that you don't have the right solution. You might respond by keeping yourself so busy that you don't have any time to engage in anyone else's drama. Instead of employing evasive tactics, just be honest and establish comfortable boundaries right from the start."
gemini,2011-07-10,"You might wish that you could bounce around today and enjoy one fun activity after another. Unfortunately, your fearful emotions might hijack the day. You may be feeling so overwhelmed that you can worry yourself into a state of panic without help from anyone else. Don't try to cover up your true feelings. Sincere communication with someone you trust can quickly turn your day around."
cancer,2011-07-10,"A recent interpersonal conflict or a disappointment in a relationship might be the cause of your current feeling of loss. Now, however, these emotional distractions are beginning to fade and you are able to find your direction anew. Don't be afraid of the silence; listening to your own thoughts can bring the clarity you seek. Even if everything isn't just the way you want it, your inner wisdom will tell you what you need to hear."
leo,2011-07-10,"Today might feel like another turning point in your continuing journey of change. There may be lots of internal movement that remains invisible to others. Your current dreams hold a significant key to your future, even if they seem disconnected from the routine of everyday life now. There's no need to share your visions with anyone else yet because keeping up your outer appearances gives you plenty of room to pursue your important inner work."
virgo,2011-07-10,"You have a positive perspective on what's happening now, but the secretive Scorpio Moon's visit to your 3rd House of Communication indicates that it's smart to keep your thoughts to yourself. Although your ideas may be uplifting, they still need some more time to develop. Sharing what's on your mind today could disperse energy that's better put toward fine-tuning your plans. Be patient; you'll be ready to tell your story tomorrow."
libra,2011-07-10,"You may need to put your attention on managing your money today, especially if you're insecure about your fiscal situation. The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Personal Resources can bring the material world into focus, raising concerns about whether or not you can meet your financial obligations. Nevertheless, a positive attitude could shift the energy in the right direction. Ultimately, your fears may be more problematic than your current circumstances warrant."
scorpio,2011-07-10,"You may feel as if you're on the edge of an emotional cliff, yet you realize that there is no one to blame for your current dilemma. Thankfully, you have a strong inner resolve and you know that you'll be able to get out of the situation that you created. But this isn't just about your strength of character; it's also about your ability to transmute fear into love. Although you might feel isolated now, someone's support will be available if you allow yourself to be vulnerable enough to receive it."
sagittarius,2011-07-10,"It's difficult to accept how others react to you today, especially if they withdraw and look at you with puzzlement. Your confidence is tested because you may not receive the positive feedback you expect. Fortunately, you're able to find a bright spot, even in the midst of a difficult situation, and concentrating on it is the key to manifesting the highest potential. Remember, your imagination can create the future that you want."
capricorn,2011-07-10,"It's crucial to reestablish your center today, especially if you have been standing on unstable ground. You are more comfortable if you know exactly where you are and what you are doing, but you probably won't have that luxury now. Give yourself time to regain your confidence. Don't just blindly continue on your old path; regroup and set fresh goals before calculating your new course."
aquarius,2011-07-10,"Your emotions are riled up today, but that doesn't mean you want others to know how you're feeling. You might wish that you had a plan to keep your turmoil to yourself, but your deep concerns may bubble up to the surface anyhow. Nothing will be gained by pretending everything is okay, but you don't have to share more than you want. There's a magical healing process unfolding, and attempts to control it will only slow it down."
pisces,2011-07-10,"You have lofty goals and can make great headway toward them if you set your mind to it. Fortunately, you're confident about your ability to stay on track today and are less likely than usual to be distracted by your shifting moods. Concentrate on what's in your heart and act on your feelings. Remember, you don't have to prove anything to others now; all you need to do is focus on your destination."
aries,2011-07-11,"You're very excited about all the possibilities in your life now that the fiery Sagittarius Moon is tempting you to push your limits even further. You could even believe that the signs are telling you to go ahead and do it all, even if you don't have enough energy to keep up with such an active schedule. Be smart and practice saying no, or you might spread yourself so thin that you end up exhausting yourself and having no fun at all."
taurus,2011-07-11,"You may spend too much money on something you don't really need, but impulsive purchases aren't necessarily a smart idea today. Although you might regret your momentary lack of fiscal discipline, you could be motivated to act now if you think that you'll lose your chance by letting the opportunity pass. However, the sense of urgency is an illusion and isn't based on what's actually happening. You can avoid buyer's remorse if you simply take extra time to weigh your options prior to opening your wallet."
gemini,2011-07-11,"Your key planet Mercury harmonizes with pushy Mars in your friendly sign today, provoking you to talk up a storm. But however enticing a social invitation sounds now, you might need some time to relax away from other people. Everyone seems to be encouraging you to do more, but you don't have to live up to their expectations. Instead of succumbing to peer pressure, listen to your own voice and do what sounds right."
cancer,2011-07-11,The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Employment may mean that your big ideas about what you intend to accomplish at work today are not realistic. It's healthy to remember that even your most sensible plans might need to be set aside if you're distracted by something more interesting than your responsibilities. It's not that you're feeling scattered; it's just that boredom is setting in. It's okay to explore new avenues of expression as long as you follow through with everything you start.
leo,2011-07-11,"You are highly enthusiastic about playing with your friends, even if you have real work to do today. It's hard to get the fun and games out of your mind, whether or not you can participate in them. However, you may be tired of having to take the lead to make anything happen. Acknowledging that you deserve some downtime is part of your solution now; the other part is scheduling your day so you fit in some work and some play."
virgo,2011-07-11,"You feel as if you're at odds with yourself today because you can't find the right balance between too little and too much. You are naturally competent in handling details. However, your current extravagance tempts you to promise more than you can deliver, especially if you skim over a crucial piece of information. Thinking about all the possibilities now is healthy as long as you remember that your common sense is still your greatest asset."
libra,2011-07-11,"Your friends may believe that you're a bit imbalanced today, especially if your optimism pushes you toward big thinking. Although everything may appear better than it actually is now, you might overcompensate by seeing potential problems everywhere you look. Keep in mind that the truth is somewhere in between the extremes and it's smarter to moderate your enthusiasm rather than going overboard in either direction."
scorpio,2011-07-11,"You may not be willing to let go of your financial concerns, even if you're more positive now about the future. The upbeat Sagittarius Moon shines a spotlight on your 2nd House of Possessions now and you recognize that your success depends upon consolidating your gains. If you try to bolt ahead too quickly, you may end up jeopardizing your progress. Allow your enthusiasm to build, but move forward cautiously until you build a momentum that you can sustain."
sagittarius,2011-07-11,"The Moon's return to inspirational Sagittarius reminds you of how significant your feelings are to your happiness. Unfortunately, you are sometimes tempted to override your emotions if they get in the way of an exciting activity. However, you are unable to ignore what your body tells you today. Your moods are vital indicators of your overall well-being now, so pay extra careful attention to honoring what your heart needs."
capricorn,2011-07-11,"Paradoxically, you may be very talkative today, even though you might prefer being left alone. You aren't ready to engage with the noise of the world now and it would be wise to avoid unnecessary social events and gatherings of large groups of people. Initiating meaningful one-on-one conversations allows you to connect on a deeper level with someone special. Even if being accepted by a club or a clique could help you achieve your goals, save the socializing for another day."
aquarius,2011-07-11,"You're buzzing today as the Moon in your 11th House of Friends and Associates fires up your social life, even if it's a workday. It's not easy to stay serious about your job now, unless it involves interacting with your peers. You want to be connected with your tribe, even if it's in a business rather than a personal setting. Fortunately, you'll receive the support and admiration of your co-workers if you take care of your obligations as expected."
pisces,2011-07-11,"Your vision of the future captures the imagination of your associates today, leading you to assume a greater amount of authority. You may not want to be the boss, but others realize that you're one of the few people who actually understand what's happening. Don't turn down a leadership role if you are chosen by your peers. Stand up and play your part; you will be able to step back with a sense of accomplishment later on."
aries,2011-07-12,"You may grow tired of encouraging other people's ideas, especially if they don't even seem to listen to yours. You want to maintain a positive attitude, but could withdraw your support if your irritation turns to resentment. Be careful how you express your frustration. Leaving close friends and co-workers to fend for themselves will only increase ill will. There's no need to overreact; expressing your concerns is healthy, but you don't have to alienate others in the process."
taurus,2011-07-12,"An unresolved issue with a workmate needs to be addressed as your key planet Venus harshly squares authoritative Saturn. You understand the importance of sharing your feelings now, but fear the negative consequences of being completely honest. Nevertheless, you must say what's on your mind or people will draw incorrect conclusions because they lack the basic facts. Being kind to others will help you move through a conflict gracefully."
gemini,2011-07-12,"You may go through a day or two of self-doubt as Venus in your 2nd House of Self-Worth squares hard-nosed Saturn. Take time to consider what is most important to you, but don't minimize the needs of others. Even if you aren't happy enough to dance in the streets, don't take it out on those nearby. Simply do what you must to make yourself more comfortable and then get busy with what must be done. Your life will quickly improve on its own if you don't focus solely on what's wrong."
cancer,2011-07-12,"Tough Saturn squares sweet Venus in your sensitive sign, signifying changes in your personal life. You are at the end of a cycle, but not ready yet to begin the next one. You might not be able to see the opportunities that are coming your way, but they are just around the corner. Don't panic and try to make something happen, but don't give up prematurely, either. Just accept that you still need time to process recent events before jumping ahead into something new."
leo,2011-07-12,"You might be anxious today, even if you cannot logically determine the source of your feelings. There could be specific issues that you're dealing with, but your worry might be out of proportion with what's actually happening now. Nevertheless, it's not wise to avoid your feelings; denial only strengthens them. Instead, pay careful attention to all physical symptoms without trying to control your sensations. Resistance is futile, so let your emotions ripple through the present moment. Tomorrow will be a brand new day."
virgo,2011-07-12,"In theory, you want to be included in a larger group of friends or associates, but you're more comfortable being an outsider today. You might think that everyone disagrees with you now, and you may feel excluded even if you don't voice your opinions. Ironically, you will be more accepted if you let your peers know exactly where you stand. No one can fault you for speaking from the heart."
libra,2011-07-12,"Your ruling planet Venus, now visiting your 10th House of Career, provokes feelings of loneliness as she squares judgmental Saturn. Emotional stress that has been pressurizing for a while could suddenly explode and turn your professional life upside down. Instead of worrying about the unknown, embrace the upcoming shift. Even if you face a temporary setback, the lessons you learn today can help to reestablish equilibrium in your life."
scorpio,2011-07-12,"The recent emphasis on your 9th House of Higher Truth enables you to see far into your own future. However, you might not be pleased with where your current path is now leading. But instead of allowing yourself to grow discouraged, concentrate on the possibilities ahead. Don't alter your present course, even if you're feeling as if something has gone awry. Today's malaise will pass, leaving you with a clearer sense of what to do tomorrow."
sagittarius,2011-07-12,"You are a champ at making your life look fabulous, yet today you might be hurting deep inside where others won't notice. You may even be uncharacteristically self-critical because your shortcomings are so apparent to you now. You will feel better if you share your new realizations with someone who will give you honest feedback. However, it's not wise to blab about your secrets to everyone, so choose your confidants carefully before you entrust them with your heart."
capricorn,2011-07-12,"You may feel lonely today as loving Venus in your 7th House of Others squares your key planet, Saturn the Taskmaster. You don't like it when someone comes down hard on you or makes unreasonable demands. However, logic can't help you decide how to respond now; trust your instincts, instead. If your gut tells you no, then don't do it. On the other hand, if you think you should get involved, give it one hundred percent, even if you must set aside a previous commitment."
aquarius,2011-07-12,"Your regular routine may feel oppressive today, yet there's no simple escape route. Nevertheless, it's still a smart idea to think about what you are doing and why you continue to do it. Naturally, breaking out of a rut sounds good, but maintaining the status quo feels much safer now. Don't make any changes until you are ready. Your motivation needs to come from within to have a significant impact."
pisces,2011-07-12,"Others may think that they understand you well enough to give you advice; however, their false assumptions only serve to alienate you. Their expectations can be quite unrealistic, yet these unfair judgments hold power over you now. Don't make any long-term decisions today, for your current emotional disconnection is warping your perspective. Be patient; a more positive outlook will return in a day or two."
aries,2011-07-13,"You are set on reaching your goals today and might not slow down if someone purposefully stands in your path. Unfortunately, confrontation isn't the best way to respond. Recognize that you may be obsessive about whatever it is you desire to do, even if you simply want to rest. The truth is that it truly does make sense to relax now while you have the chance."
taurus,2011-07-13,"Your stubbornness can land you in big trouble now, or it can serve you very well if you are already on your desired course. But you might just need a little help from your friends to steer you in the right direction, even if you think that you're not interested in listening to their opinions. Don't resist the sensible advice of a trustworthy workmate today; remind yourself to remain open to all the good ideas you hear."
gemini,2011-07-13,"You may feel uncomfortably restrained by circumstances today, since you don't have much leeway to express yourself creatively. You are being challenged to limit your thinking so your ideas will fit into the environmental constraints of the day. Even if it's difficult, focusing your attention on a limited spectrum of possibilities may help you be more effective than you ever imagined."
cancer,2011-07-13,"Someone might get on your nerves now because it seems like he or she has a plan that doesn't necessarily match up with your own. You lose patience when others assume that you'll set your agenda aside to take care of them, even if you keep your true feelings quiet and just do it anyway. Common sense rules today, so stick to the most practical plan, regardless of who thought of it first."
leo,2011-07-13,"You may have a hard time letting go of unresolved feelings today. You might not trust your senses, but everything finally seems ready to shift now. Others won't likely notice the change, but that's because they cannot see your inner workings. Nevertheless, you can't keep up appearances much longer. Be careful; your frustration can alter the dynamics between you and your closest friends in a very subtle yet long-lasting manner."
virgo,2011-07-13,"You could be leaving on a spiritual journey that's just for you today. You are exploring ways to reclaim your power, but the current dynamics might not support your growth. Don't try to manipulate circumstances in your favor. Your strength will return naturally as you rediscover your metaphysical center of gravity. Realign with your core values and exhibit the highest integrity possible in all that you do."
libra,2011-07-13,"You could be annoyed with yourself now because you didn't let someone know exactly how you were feeling. Today you can gain clarity in a way that previously eluded you. Don't question your analytical capabilities even if you are feeling incapable of integrating all the data at your fingertips. Worrying about your next move is a waste of energy, but staying in the present moment and observing your feelings has a direct, positive impact on your future."
scorpio,2011-07-13,"You may be in a position now to receive emotional support that's long overdue. Don't try to avoid change, whether or not anyone comes forward to offer personal assistance today. Even with extra demands being placed on you, it feels as if your world has become a friendlier place. You may need to set aside an unresolved relationship issue, but there's no reason to continue worrying. Instead, concentrate on keeping your balance as the big waves wash through your life."
sagittarius,2011-07-13,"You are relieved that things aren't so hectic today because there are a few serious issues to handle. Unfortunately, you may be missing important information, but you're willing to dig around for it. It's not easy to relax now because there are so many different avenues that lead to fun and adventure. Nevertheless, everyone requires a bit of downtime, so accept any peace and quiet as a gift from the cosmos."
capricorn,2011-07-13,"You are most content when your feet are firmly planted on stable ground. You like to know when to take your next step and exactly where you're going. Although you may be feeling uncharacteristically uncertain today, it won't last long. Nevertheless, you can still enjoy expressing yourself when the Moon washes through your sign. But you cannot afford to get lazy; do your planning now instead of waiting until you're in the middle of the next storm."
aquarius,2011-07-13,"You usually choose trusting your mind over relying on your heart when making decisions; however, the tables are turning now. You like the idea of intimacy and may be willing to sacrifice some hard-core data for an opportunity to intensify a relationship. You've been thinking about pushing past your resistance for a while, but powerful emotions can still make you uncomfortable. Remember, although you aren't required to share everything all at once, it's a good time to start turning fantasies into reality."
pisces,2011-07-13,"It's smart to involve your friends and co-workers in your planning process now, for group participation makes your day more enjoyable and efficient. Others may enter the picture with important keys to your future, and if you don't welcome their presence, you'll never know what might have been possible. Don't allow old fears of failure to sabotage your current dreams by discouraging you before you even start."
aries,2011-07-14,"You might think that working extra hard today will enable you to do everything that is expected of you. However, a magical quintile between your key planet Mars and brilliant Uranus can create some distracting fireworks. An unexpected series of events could turn your day into an obstacle course. Nevertheless, don't blame your shortfall on someone else; how you handle your responsibilities is still up to you."
taurus,2011-07-14,"You have a variety of alternatives to pick from today as you contemplate where you want to go. But your resources seem to be limited by the current circumstances, so you need to be creative enough to find the best route to your goals. Whether you lack money or time, don't waste your energy by micromanaging the details of every contingency. Narrow the field of options before you start fine-tuning your plan."
gemini,2011-07-14,"It's becoming more apparent day by day that you can't do everything you set your heart on, even though you're ready to give it all you've got. Unfortunately, using brute force will only exhaust you, without guaranteeing that you'll accomplish your goals. Instead, try a different tactic now by employing self-discipline. Reining in your activities will make you happier in the long run. Remember, a focused approach is better than a scattered one."
cancer,2011-07-14,"It's admirable to be sensitive to the needs of others, but it's not healthy if your happiness depends on someone else's feelings. The biggest problem with putting the determinant of your emotional well-being in anyone else's hands is that you can't be responsible for other people's shifting moods. Fortunately, you can have positive impact on a situation by changing your own attitude. Remember, nurturing begins with taking care yourself."
leo,2011-07-14,"You may sense the emotional tension increasing between you and your workmates. Unfortunately, you might not know how to react. It's useless to try and change what you're feeling when all you need to do is improve your outward behavior. Nevertheless, you will only fuel inner conflict today by making believe that everything is okay. Ultimately, total honesty is the wisest defense."
virgo,2011-07-14,"Thankfully, the intensity level at work seems to be lower now, yet you're still not convinced that everything is really returning to normal. To the contrary, you might be wondering if anything in your life will ever be the same. Fortunately, you don't need to take major action today. Just recognize that although this is a stressful period, you can still have a positive outlook about current events."
libra,2011-07-14,"The Moon's visit to your 4th House of Family can bring extra parental responsibilities or other familial commitments, creating a little crisis as you attempt to squeeze everything into your schedule. It's a real problem because there's so much to do that you can't possibly feel satisfied by the amount you manage to accomplish. Unfortunately, your anxiety probably won't prevent you from trying the impossible. However, the sooner you simplify your environment, the more time you'll have available for others."
scorpio,2011-07-14,"You had a chance recently to share what's on your mind with friends. Unfortunately, your window of opportunity is starting to close, so you must jump into the conversation as quickly as possible. The time for contemplation has passed. Whatever remains unsaid today may be banished into the shadows for an indeterminate amount of time."
sagittarius,2011-07-14,"You need to be serious now and expect others to respect your somber attitude. However, you still may be unable to concentrate on your current obligations. Good intentions may not take you as far as you want to go today; you have to walk your talk to be recognized. Coming up with all the right words is easy now; however, it's quite another thing to put them into action."
capricorn,2011-07-14,"You might claim that you aren't trying to get ahead at work now, but something is changing and you would be wise to make the most of it. It's tempting to ignore the current pressures, yet the instability may be just the catalyst you need. But it's not just about grabbing an irresistible opportunity; the real message is about how your desires are awakening. Set new long-term goals that can ultimately fulfill your most basic needs."
aquarius,2011-07-14,"You might try to float through the day by doing as little as possible, but you won't likely get away with it. Even if you don't do much, you may retrospectively wish that you worked harder in the morning. You won't be able to accept a surprise invitation later in the day if you're not finished with your duties. But if you already fulfilled your responsibilities, this afternoon can bring unexpected pleasure."
pisces,2011-07-14,"You can talk yourself out of your confidence as the day wears on, especially if you agreed to show up at a social event this evening. But retreating for a while enables you to emerge physically refreshed and emotionally recharged, ready for another round of battles to fight off unnecessary change. Don't be afraid of expressing your own power now, even if you think that you should wait for a better time to act."
aries,2011-07-15,"Even if you want to stay home, today's Moon in your 10th House of Public Responsibility indicates that you have a lot happening at work. You might have agreed to one too many projects and now you have to show up, even if you don't feel like it. Thankfully, a methodical approach and consistent effort positively impact your progress toward reaching your goals."
taurus,2011-07-15,"You may be more determined than ever about taking an upcoming trip, even if your plans seem to be in jeopardy. Instead of just working harder, you will also need to think smarter. The Full Moon in your 9th House of Adventure is motivational, yet a breakthrough can't occur if you're unwilling to step outside of your safety zone and try something new. A calculated risk may be necessary to make something big happen."
gemini,2011-07-15,"You might not want to reveal everything you know today, because withholding information could give you an advantage in dealing with others. Even if you try to talk your way out of a complex issue, you won't be able to avoid some pretty tough questions now. But don't expect any straightforward answers because there aren't any. Nevertheless, if you want a relationship to work, you need to go deeper into your emotions. Shared intimacy is a reward that you must be willing to work for on a regular basis."
cancer,2011-07-15,"Today's Full Moon brightens your 7th House of Relationships, stirring up a bit of trouble or excitement. A current partnership could run into a wall that requires you to focus on your emotions and communicate what you're feeling as clearly as you can. If there's someone new in your life, resolving a touchy conflict now can set the foundation for what comes next. Either way, you'll do better if you respond directly from your heart."
leo,2011-07-15,"You need to maintain consistency in your daily routine, but it's challenging if your heart isn't connected to your actions today. You are only able to pretend for a while before your behavior has a negative impact on the day. Nevertheless, the practical Capricorn Full Moon illuminates your 6th House of Habits, telling you not to make any drastic changes to your regular schedule. Hold steady to your course; you'll gain traction again soon enough."
virgo,2011-07-15,"The Full Moon lights up your 5th House of Self-Expression today, prompting you to reveal your feelings rather than analyze them. But your key planet Mercury nervously aspects high-strung Uranus, making it tricky to find the right words. Instead of trying to respond spontaneously as you're experiencing an emotion, let it pass. Share what's going on only after you've had time to process what just happened."
libra,2011-07-15,"You're eager to shine your light at work now that the radiant Sun is illuminating your 10th House of Career. However, the Full Moon occurs in your 4th House of Foundations, indicating that a situation at home needs your immediate attention, too. You might think that you can't do everything, but your logic need not stop you from trying. Be innovative and look for solutions that are outside the box. Ultimately, you're capable of a lot more than you currently believe."
scorpio,2011-07-15,"Today's sobering Capricorn Full Moon floods your 3rd House of Communication with data that might be overwhelming to integrate. The intensity has been building for a while, giving you the chance to prepare for the hectic pace of events. Don't hesitate to lean on friends if you need support. Surprisingly, they will respond more positively than you expect. It may take a few days, but you'll be able to get the rest you need."
sagittarius,2011-07-15,"You have one foot in the past and one in the future today. The restrictive Capricorn Full Moon falls in your 2nd House of Values, binding you to old beliefs and traditions. But trickster Mercury is buzzing in your 9th House of Expansion, tempting you to leave everything behind and make a mad dash forward. Unfortunately, your natural tendency to aim high means that you could overshoot your mark. Focus on reaching a conservative goal now, instead of falling short of an unrealistic one."
capricorn,2011-07-15,"Someone with authority may require your support today. Thankfully, you're sympathetic to other people's pain as the Full Moon sensitizes your 1st House of Physicality. However, you might also try to hold someone else's angst distant from your own feelings to protect your heart. Unfortunately, this defensive reaction can prevent you from being in touch with your emotions. Consciously listen with an open mind and then respond honestly from your heart."
aquarius,2011-07-15,"Today's serious Capricorn Full Moon occurs in your 12th House of Destiny, foretelling the enduring consequences that your current choices can have. However, it's easy to place too much importance on making your decision now and not enough on following through with concrete action. Don't be so quick to talk about your plans; instead of putting your energy into unnecessary chatter, let others find out about your new direction from what you do."
pisces,2011-07-15,"You may think that others are trying to trick you into putting aside your personal agenda and following their plan as the Full Moon reflects the needs of your 11th House of Team Effort. Even if you're an integral part of a workgroup, you might feel isolated if your ideas differ from everyone else's. Nevertheless, it's crucial to honor your instincts now and do what feels right. Don't succumb to peer pressure just because you want to feel connected to others."
aries,2011-07-16,"You may be unconcerned about your responsibilities today as your thoughts drift toward the big picture. You are usually quite skilled at focusing your attention on the present moment, but now you might be looking ahead and wondering what's around the next bend in the road. However, it's wise to avoid making any major decisions about your future. Instead, keep your options open for another few days."
taurus,2011-07-16,"Normally you would concentrate on a work-related matter when the Moon is in your 10th House of Career, but now it's difficult to follow through on your commitments. Although it's challenging to slow down your thoughts enough to relax, it's still an intelligent idea to schedule some time off. You will need extra energy in reserve for when things pick up again next week."
gemini,2011-07-16,"Your life seems to be flowing along a bit easier now, even if the same issues are still nagging for resolution. Fortunately, you won't have to worry about them today, easing the tension sufficiently for you to enjoy the present moment. Just remember that your overactive imagination could carry you far away, distracting you from the happiness that is right under your nose. Open your eyes and be grateful for what you have."
cancer,2011-07-16,"You may be feeling alienated today, even if family and friends are nearby. You cherish your privacy and may keep to yourself, even if secrecy increases the emotional gulf between you and others. However, this self-imposed isolation also reminds you of your inner strength. Don't be sidetracked by any lingering self-doubt; use your current time alone to contemplate your options before making an overdue decision."
leo,2011-07-16,"The Moon's presence in your 7th House of Relationships shifts the focus from what you are doing to observing everyone's reactions. However, you might feel as if others are withdrawing from you and keeping their emotions to themselves. Don't rely on your perceptions to give you objective data now, because you could get carried away with your fantasies. Stop spinning stories and just listen to what your heart says."
virgo,2011-07-16,"It's usually your style to roll up your sleeves and get the job done, but closure on any project doesn't come easily now. It might even seem as if your final destination is slipping away the closer you get. Obviously, giving up is not the preferred answer; it's smarter to accept the timing that reality imposes on you now. Keep moving forward without measuring how far there is yet to go."
libra,2011-07-16,"Creative thoughts are running rampant through your head as the Moon activates your 5th House of Self-Expression. But it's up to you to decide how to express yourself. Unfortunately, a brilliant idea might have little to do with your pressing obligations. Don't become discouraged; instead, work extra hard to be responsible. Thankfully, you'll still have time to make contact with your inner child for some spontaneous outbursts of joy."
scorpio,2011-07-16,"If the Moon's visit to your 4th House of Foundations brings you back to your childhood, don't let the memories of your past come between the present moment and your future. Naturally, you want to be successful in everything you do. You may even have your bucket list of ideal moments you have yet to experience, but these dreams seem very far away right now. Meanwhile, you have some serious things to think about, but don't let that stop you from making plans to improve your world."
sagittarius,2011-07-16,"There are so many things on your to-do list today, that it really doesn't even matter where you jump in. One thing is for sure: procrastinating isn't helpful. Unless you get started right away, you may find yourself in trouble by the end of the day. Remember, a sensible plan is a great first step, but you still must work diligently to follow through on anything that you start."
capricorn,2011-07-16,"You don't want to be caught up in a whirlwind of intense activity today since you know that it's better to finish one thing well than do many things carelessly. However, it's challenging to stay focused now, especially if others have a different notion of what you should do. You will be fine if you just remember to employ common sense throughout the day. Keep things real, no matter what curve balls come your way."
aquarius,2011-07-16,"The Moon's monthly visit to your sign reminds you once again that you're happier when you pay attention to your feelings -- even if they temporarily make you uncomfortable. It's tempting to suppress your emotions in favor of a more rational approach. This evasive strategy might enable you to move more quickly through a situation, but you could miss an important lesson. Slow down and allow your heart, instead of your head, to tell you what you need to hear."
pisces,2011-07-16,"Recent emotional confusion might have sapped your energy, making you tired of talking about your feelings. You may even want a temporary break from your romantic attachments. Thankfully, the Moon's emphasis on your 12th House of Privacy encourages you to be alone. Don't worry about how anyone else might react to your desire for a bit of solitude. Take care of your needs first; everyone will benefit once you return from your little getaway refreshed and revitalized."
aries,2011-07-17,"You're strongly influenced by your own illusions now, yet these fantasies can motivate you to move past your current limitations. Unfortunately, you may be frustrated by the wide gulf between what you want and what you currently have. But don't back down; keep your hopes alive by feeding them with your attention. Just don't let your dreams become so important than you forget about your responsibilities. Focus on what's happening today if you want to reach your goals tomorrow."
taurus,2011-07-17,"Although you're able to adequately handle any problems that come your way now, maintaining your concentration may be exhausting because you're unwilling to let down your guard. As soon as your mind drifts, something happens that reveals your vulnerability and causes you to lose focus. Fortunately, your mistakes teach you what you need to know as long as you keep bringing yourself back to the tasks at hand."
gemini,2011-07-17,"You feel a bit scattered now with Mars moving through your sign, but you can make progress today, even in the midst of this rather ungrounded phase. Although you may have an opportunity to do something exciting, don't leave your personal commitments unfulfilled. Fun and games can wait; you'll feel better if you accomplish your goals, so continue working on what's most important."
cancer,2011-07-17,"You can develop a deep sense of satisfaction if you establish a manageable pace early in the day and keep it going as long as possible. Although you're able to get a lot done today, don't be too self-critical if you need to take a break. Working too hard now will backfire, so when you start to lose momentum, give yourself permission to escape for a while. Some good old-fashioned relaxation will do you a world of good."
leo,2011-07-17,"Although everyone seems to want you to join in social festivities today, you might prefer to relax by yourself or do something special with one close friend, instead. Nevertheless, the idea of partying with others is still attractive, but you're somewhat cautious about wasting your energy on frivolities. Listen to your intuition now, for it won't steer you astray."
virgo,2011-07-17,"You may become annoyed if someone bothers you today with an idea that isn't well conceived. You won't buy into a plan just because it's new and different; you want hard facts, accurate figures and plenty of details. However, you don't need to stick your nose where it doesn't belong just to impose your high level of critical analysis onto someone else's business. Process your judgments on your own and try not to rain on anyone's parade."
libra,2011-07-17,"You have good ideas about how to get things done today, but putting your plan into motion isn't quite as simple as you expect. Something that seems reasonable may turn out to be completely unrealistic. Don't waste energy trying to accomplish the impossible. Instead, alter your goals to make them more attainable. It's better to set yourself up for a taste of success than the frustration of falling short."
scorpio,2011-07-17,"Your fun-loving friends may come to the rescue today as the Sun in nurturing Cancer illuminates imaginative Neptune in your playful 5th house. Others may even seem irresponsible in their expressed desire for pleasure, but you would do well now to let them whisk you off to a wonderful adventure. This lighthearted energy can lift your spirits, so don't resist the potential of a good time."
sagittarius,2011-07-17,"You may engage in a conversation with a very interesting person today, distracting you from your personal agenda. You might even have close friends or siblings that fascinate you with stories of the past. But don't fall into a trap of seemingly endless gossip. Talking about someone else now will only waste time that could be put to much better use. Be smart and use your resources to improve your life, encouraging others to follow your lead."
capricorn,2011-07-17,"You could be a bit confused about your financial picture today. For example, maybe you made an investment that fell short of your expectations. Or perhaps you miscalculated the amount of cash on hand which led you to make a bad decision about spending. Don't be embarrassed about your current fiscal issues, whatever they may be now. Being honest about your finances can actually strengthen an important relationship."
aquarius,2011-07-17,"You may be overly optimistic today as your idealism overpowers your sense of reality. Instead of making choices now that could affect your future in big ways, put off important decisions for a few days until clarity returns. Remember, change won't happen overnight, so you have more time than you think. Don't rush your own process. Pull back a bit and see where your feelings lead."
pisces,2011-07-17,"A good friend may seem overly critical today, but there's no need to expend your time or energy defending yourself. You don't have to prove your competence now; being right is not as important as you think. Instead of starting from the premise that you're not good enough, try the opposite strategy and assume that you are fine just as you are. Ultimately, your current path to self-improvement is revealed by your inner process and not by anyone else's expectations."
aries,2011-07-18,"You may be feeling somewhat deflated today, as if you've seen something you truly want yet know you cannot have. You could even grow annoyed with yourself for falling victim to your own unrealistic expectations. However, your frown can transform into a smile once you understand that you are the source of your confusion now. The truth may not be what you wished for, but it can still set you free."
taurus,2011-07-18,"You want to be on your best behavior today, but you still could get yourself into trouble if you believe that you can fix everything. Nevertheless, it's tempting to overestimate the positive results of your actions. You appreciate a new opportunity, but may become frustrated if it disappears as suddenly as it arrived. Even so, there's no reason for discouragement to come between you and another good prospect. Fortunately, your irrepressible dreams continue to pull you toward success."
gemini,2011-07-18,"You might not be able to justify starting so many activities now because your responsibilities require that you follow one specific task through to completion. Unfortunately, you're feeling restless and more inclined to jump from one project to another. Ironically, narrowing your focus onto a single goal can actually open new avenues for exploration, so don't be so eager to beat the system and move on too soon."
cancer,2011-07-18,"You would like nothing more than to live in a free-spirited world of sunshine and flowers today, but reality can't live up to your fantastic expectations. Unfortunately, the Moon's visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas isn't very helpful if you need to focus your attention on more practical issues. Set aside a bit of time for aimless daydreaming, but then come back to earth and get busy with your work."
leo,2011-07-18,"You could have the most amazing vision today, and by demonstrating patience and follow-through you may even be able to produce something special. Even if you're not Beethoven or Rembrandt, a lack of artistic skills need not stand in your way. Although you would like your work to be appreciated, it's more important now to be creative, whether or not anyone else notices what you do. Remember, it's currently about the process rather than the finished product."
virgo,2011-07-18,"You can drive yourself crazy today if you try to narrow your attention on solving one particular problem. Unfortunately, the more you attend to details, the more your mind escapes the confines of the current situation as forced logic morphs into fuzzy thinking. Instead of approaching the current dilemma from a logical perspective, just imagine the desired outcome and start off in that direction without worrying about what you'll do next."
libra,2011-07-18,"You're eager to share your ideas at work, but they may not be ready for an unsuspecting audience yet. It's like a dream that makes perfect sense until you start to tell it to someone else -- and then it quickly fades back into the shadows. Paradoxically, even your most sensible plan grows fuzzier as you elaborate on the details. Skip the wordy explanation today; you can bring others up to date in a day or two."
scorpio,2011-07-18,"You really don't want to waste time discussing trivial subjects today, but ironically, you don't seem to be able to avoid it. You would rather place the endless stream of words on hold in order to intensify a current emotional dynamic. Keep in mind that you may have to engage in superficial conversations just to make it through the workday. It's not an either/or situation; you can still make time to explore more meaningful topics later with someone you trust."
sagittarius,2011-07-18,"You're enthusiastic about taking a journey, yet uncertainty is beginning to take root and you don't understand why. Worries about your family or concerns about your own emotional security may prevent you from traveling anywhere, now. Fortunately, you can go somewhere without ever leaving home. The advantage of a mental excursion is that no one will even know that you're gone. You can explore the distant reaches of the universe in your imagination while on the job and still return in the wink of an eye to answer the phone."
capricorn,2011-07-18,"You aren't averse to floating around in the realms of your imagination; however, you start to feel anxious if you go out too far in the process. You may struggle today if there's no obvious way to return to solid ground, but your fear is more of a problem than the actual situation. You can avoid stress by consciously staying connected with your work. Be creative, but don't fly so high that you get lost in the clouds."
aquarius,2011-07-18,"It may seem as if you are losing touch with reality now, but this perception is only an illusion. People can't see your inner process, so they don't understand that you're actually being very pragmatic today. You can take advantage of this temporary confusion since you don't appear to be threatening to anyone. Be assertive and push for what you want. You might be pleasantly surprised at the results."
pisces,2011-07-18,"You are very smooth at shifting metaphysical gears and slipping in and out of the real world so fast that no one even notices your absence. Even heavy responsibilities won't stop you from enjoying your mini-escapes to other realms today. But consider scheduling a block of time for your mental adventures, instead of trying to squeeze them into short moments here and there. Stretching your mind into imaginary places is healthy as long as you also get your work done."
aries,2011-07-19,"Hiding out might sound like a good plan, especially if you've been overdoing it on the social scene. Fortunately, you don't have to worry about being alone for long because you're too engaged with others to withdraw completely. It's simply time for some rest. If possible, you would be wise to coast for a bit while you can today, since you'll be raring to go tomorrow when the Moon returns to your fiery sign."
taurus,2011-07-19,"You don't have to agree with everything that others want to do today, especially since jumping from one project to another isn't your preferred modus operandi. Actually, it makes sense to find some time to chill out and dream about your future, rather than being so busy running around. However, keep in mind that you won't be able to avoid being part of the group for too long, so take advantage of the time you now have to relax."
gemini,2011-07-19,"Paying more attention to your career is a smart plan now that the Moon is visiting your 10th House of Public Responsibility. However, your dreams can overtake reality when you're thinking about your professional objectives. Instead of assuming that anything is possible, temper your vision with a bit of common sense. Remember, you can't just believe your way to success; you also need a sound strategy and the determination to follow through with it."
cancer,2011-07-19,"Your emotional involvement in planning your future makes it challenging today to separate your desires from reality. You might believe that your perception of a current situation is valid, yet it's colored by your opinions more than you realize. Instead of being overly judgmental now, simply describe an event without showing your bias. There will be plenty of time later to express your feelings when it really counts."
leo,2011-07-19,"Your intuition is functioning very well today, enabling you to sense what's happening underneath the surface. You don't need anyone to tell you the details, but you should be careful because your perspective may be warped by an old fear that now comes back to haunt you. It's healthy to remember what happened as long as you understand the difference between the present and the past."
virgo,2011-07-19,"You may be concerned that your schedule is overbooked today, but you don't see any way to cut back on your activities. You're usually motivated to be efficient and do as others expect, but your dreams can be more pressing than what's actually happening right now. There's no reason to frustrate yourself by trying to bridge the gap between reality and your imagination. Give yourself permission to explore idealistic possibilities without having to make any of them come true."
libra,2011-07-19,"You cannot seem to get much accomplished today because you're not being very practical. Your idealism is fueling your strategy and your plans may not be concrete enough. Unfortunately, you cannot fit your ideas into the narrow confines of a calendar. You'll be happier now if you take action when you feel like it, rather than forcing your creativity to conform to someone else's clock."
scorpio,2011-07-19,"A creative stream of images floods into your awareness now, but you might have a tough time expressing your ideas to anyone. Although you could have a very clear picture established in your mind, it fades as your day unfolds. If you want to start a project that truly captures your imagination, do it today. Don't wait for anyone's approval because your excitement will begin to dissipate if you don't act soon."
sagittarius,2011-07-19,"Today's Pisces Moon feels like the beginning of an end. You're ready to call it quits and start something new, but you may be jumping the gun. Stick to what you're doing for another day, even if you're already bored. You'll gain more now by sinking into your feelings about your past than distracting yourself by prematurely changing your direction."
capricorn,2011-07-19,"It's challenging to manage your schedule today as the diffusive Pisces Moon moves through your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. You might even mix up the time of an appointment or meeting. But reining in control by paying attention to details won't work either, for someone else may be the source of trouble. Practice detachment and let your plans unravel if they must. Don't worry; you'll be able to put the pieces back together in a way that will work better than your original agenda anyhow."
aquarius,2011-07-19,"A concerted effort to demonstrate how important your values are won't prevent others from ignoring you if they disagree with your ideas. You still might try your hand at making an intelligent plea to muster support for your point of view. Fortunately, your words may have more impact than you realize because it's nearly impossible to get a clear read on anyone now. Say what's on your mind and then let it go. Don't judge your progress until tomorrow."
pisces,2011-07-19,"The Moon's monthly visit to your sign usually brightens the colors of your dreams. The edges of reality are softened, luring you into believing something that may be quite irrational. Don't try to distinguish the differences between fact and fiction today because some of your beliefs could cross the line, flipping back and forth without concern for logic. See what changes the next few days bring before you make up your mind."
aries,2011-07-20,"There is plenty of excitement today, yet you have no way of knowing what will happen next. Contrary to popular belief, you actually enjoy a bit of stability, but the routine can get to you, prompting you to crave dramatic change. However, you would prefer to be in control, but you might not be in charge now. Accept the challenge by letting go and trusting that someone else will step in and do the right thing."
taurus,2011-07-20,"Everyone seems to be acting strangely today as if they want more independence but are afraid to ask for it. You don't want to prevent others from taking charge of their lives, but your insecurities might get in the way of your reaction. Don't shy away from exploring your own fears now, for you may have lessons to learn about your irrational feelings. Taking the time to sort through your emotional process can help more than you think."
gemini,2011-07-20,"Unconventional ideas about your future can be upsetting to the status quo, yet you cannot stop thinking about them. You might even find that you enjoy the uncertainty as you eagerly plot your next move. However, it's not beneficial to pick a path too quickly. In the meantime, research all the alternatives so you can make an educated choice. The more options you have now, the better the outcome will be when you're finally required to choose your direction."
cancer,2011-07-20,"You feel a familiar discomfort if you respond impulsively now. Sometimes you miss a wonderful opportunity because you worry about making a wrong decision. Today, however, inaction is not your problem. You are excited and want to get started in a hurry. But if you act too soon, you may find yourself considering the roads not taken. It's smarter to be cautious before you make your move; there's not as much of a hurry as you might think."
leo,2011-07-20,"You are apt to lose your temper today if you think that someone is preventing you from doing a job your way. Or, your rash behavior could provoke someone else's anger. Either way, remember that extreme feelings stem from a deeper imbalance and you won't solve anything by just suppressing your emotions. A real solution comes from analyzing your assumptions and unraveling your logic so you can deal with the source of your motivation in a calm and reasonable manner."
virgo,2011-07-20,"Others may seem totally irrational today and their unexpected behavior can be very unsettling. However, the Moon's entry into confrontational Aries gives you permission to express your concerns, even if it precipitates an argument. But don't spend too much time questioning yourself and sorting through all your options. Your most reliable strategy now is to act first and ask questions later."
libra,2011-07-20,"Taking a break from your work is a healthy thing to do now, especially if you have something to show for your recent efforts. Instead of focusing on your responsibilities, pay more attention to your personal life. Whether you're seeking out a new relationship or trying to revitalize an old one, don't be afraid to express your feelings as directly and succinctly as you can. Your honesty and clarity may be enough to create the fireworks you crave."
scorpio,2011-07-20,"You might be in for a surprise today as the fiery Aries Moon-Uranus conjunction zaps your 6th House of Work. You don't need to look for trouble; it will probably find you. However, any problems that come to the surface now are just revealing something that you've been trying to avoid. Don't worry if things get out of hand for a while; circumstances will become more supportive, even if it takes a day or two for your stress to settle down."
sagittarius,2011-07-20,"You don't like receiving mixed messages because they make you feel as if you're unable to respond properly. You enjoy the excitement of riding along on a rapidly moving current that's carrying you to an unknown destination. However, your swift movement still can meet resistance today, which provokes you to push even harder. Unfortunately, you won't be able to progress any faster, so avoid the temptation to rush the process. Ultimately, practicing patience is more productive now than forcing the issue."
capricorn,2011-07-20,"The hectic pace increases throughout the day, making it difficult for you to find respite today. Although you're drawn toward the action, you may feel frustrated if you cannot get resolution on an important dilemma now. But don't turn an insignificant question into one of ultimate concern just to relieve your boredom. You don't need any more distractions, so just be quiet and listen to the wisdom of your inner voice."
aquarius,2011-07-20,"You don't want to waste your time while waiting around for someone else, but you may also have your own delays to manage today. You know something big is about to happen, yet you don't seem to be able to push things along. Unfortunately, you can frustrate yourself if you don't change your perspective. Settling back into your comfort zone for a while won't be difficult if you remember that the real fun is still on the way."
pisces,2011-07-20,"Although the Moon leaves your sign midday, you still feel emotionally charged. Your morning moodiness can explode into a barrage of words if you think that your feelings aren't being respected by your friends or co-workers. But you won't reach satisfaction through dialogue now; talking about your concerns might only make matters worse. Instead of attempting to force change, focus on adjusting your own attitude. When your outlook improves, so will everything else."
aries,2011-07-21,"You don't need to wait until the Moon visits your impulsive sign in order to take an unnecessary risk. However, today's Aries Moon provokes you to say yes quickly, before considering the alternatives. The Moon's midday opposition to stern Saturn in your 7th House of Relationships indicates that a critical friend or partner could come down on you pretty hard. Don't jump to defend yourself against someone else's judgmental perspective. Remember, there might be a real lesson here for you to learn."
taurus,2011-07-21,"Perhaps you've been quite busy trying to keep up with everything that's happening, so taking some time to be by yourself today sounds like a good idea. But now as you try to retreat it seems as if others won't leave you alone. Although everyone appears to have a different idea of what you should be doing, it's up to you to resist outside pressure by clearly establishing your boundaries."
gemini,2011-07-21,"Even if today is a workday, you may be more interested in the social aspects of your life than performing your job. You might be tempted to take a long lunch, waste time in idle chatter with your coworkers or look for other ways to fulfill your need for interaction. Unfortunately, your boss or some other authority figure could step in and prevent you from escaping your duties. Be smart; finishing your task list early in the day will leave you time to play later on."
cancer,2011-07-21,"You're uncharacteristically eager to take charge at work today and others may be surprised with your actions. Although sometimes people assume that you are shy, you're quite willing to be in control when you know where you are going. Just be careful not to indiscriminately share your feelings with everyone. Finding the right person to confide in can make all the difference in the world."
leo,2011-07-21,"You might not be satisfied with what's happening in the present moment, tempting you to escape into your dreams. However, withdrawing into fantasies isn't a viable strategy for achieving long-term happiness. Thankfully, the courageous Aries Moon in your 9th House of Adventure prompts you to make changes in order to bring the excitement you seek back into your life. Nevertheless, you will still have to do what others expect of you prior to putting your big plan into motion."
virgo,2011-07-21,"Your friends and associates might have a hidden agenda today. On the surface, they may continue to support you if you retreat from the social scene in order to delve deeper into your own feelings. However, you can feel the pressure from their unspoken demands, provoking you to pull away even more now. One way to ameliorate the current situation is to let others know that you just need some time alone and will reconnect with them once you are ready to return to the game."
libra,2011-07-21,"Someone close to you may seem a bit too aggressive as the Moon visits brash Aries and your 7th House of Others today. Thankfully, a lunar opposition to stern Saturn in your diplomatic sign enables you to clearly set the limits you need to feel comfortable. However, you could overreact and inadvertently push the other person away. Relationships require give and take, so remain open to continuing communication as long as your boundaries are respected."
scorpio,2011-07-21,"You won't likely sit around doing nothing today with the irrepressible Aries Moon activating your 6th House of Work. But you could be so enthusiastic about getting through your to-do list that you rush into your tasks before you consider the smartest approach. Unfortunately, you may waste time and energy without finishing what you start unless you're willing to slow down, rethink your strategy and begin anew."
sagittarius,2011-07-21,"It feels like a playday to you, but promises that you made to others might prevent you from having too much fun. You may believe that everything would be fine if only your friends and coworkers ease up on you. But their expectations probably aren't that unreasonable. Instead of scheming to escape or complaining that life isn't fair, see how creative you can be while fulfilling your obligations."
capricorn,2011-07-21,The Moon's opposition to your key planet Saturn puts you in touch with the emotions that often get in the way of your success. Ambitious Saturn's presence in your 10th House of Career motivates you to set high standards and do whatever it takes to accomplish your goals. But the impulsive Aries Moon leads you to believe that you can arrive at your destination faster by taking a few unauthorized shortcuts. Avoid the potential for frustration by doing things right and giving yourself plenty of time to finish your work.
aquarius,2011-07-21,"You may be running around in circles today without having much to show for all your efforts. Instead of continuing to spin your wheels, stop for a while so you can reestablish your connection with the ground. Naturally, a more practical approach will help, but restarting slowly is the real key to gaining traction. You'll be able to deliver on your promises as long as you don't blindly rush ahead."
pisces,2011-07-21,You may benefit now by adopting a steady approach to a financial problem that's been bothering you. But ignoring the facts and attempting to solve the dilemma by taking aggressive action won't be useful as the Moon in your 2nd House of Money runs into a tense opposition with stern Saturn today. Don't try to shift the blame for a difficult situation onto anyone else. Take responsibility for your position and establish a sensible plan to alleviate the current pressure.
aries,2011-07-22,"You may try to go off in several directions by following your changing moods, but this multidirectional strategy just won't work today. Your feelings are in a continual state of flux now that the Moon is back in your sign for a couple of days. Perhaps you normally find comfort in the idea of being seen for who you are. But it's really not necessary to call attention to your concerns, so flying under the radar for a day or two makes more sense."
taurus,2011-07-22,"Today might seem like a great day to slip away for a while, but you may feel such guilt about abandoning your work that you wouldn't enjoy your escape, anyhow. The Moon in your 12th House of Secrets reveals that someone could be undermining your efforts. However, this is not a good day to confront anyone. Avoiding conflict is a smart strategy for now while you just go on with your daily life. You can plan on taking a longer journey once you feel more settled."
gemini,2011-07-22,"You have left your world open to change in many ways, but you may grow anxious today as you play through the possible scenarios. Your response to fear is often to dance around the edges of it by practicing avoidance techniques. Don't be overly harsh on yourself; instead, accept the fact that realizing a goal is going to take longer than you thought."
cancer,2011-07-22,"The initiating Aries Moon traveling through your 10th House of Career is a positive reminder to take bold action within your community. If you aren't happy waiting for someone else to do the work today, step forward to get the job done. Even if you don't finish everything you set out to do now, your contribution will be the catalyst needed to get the ball rolling."
leo,2011-07-22,"You are enthusiastic about making new plans based upon your inspirational ideas about the future. You may not want to collaborate with someone on a project, because you could run into problems if his or her ideal vision varies from yours. Don't try to resolve the differences now; just share your perspective and stay open to changing your mind. All you must do today is wander down the pathways of potential."
virgo,2011-07-22,"You are usually able to singularly focus your energy so one project can be completed prior to starting the next one. However, it's challenging to stay on the well-worn path today because you're eager for something new. But you may grow anxious when you can't decide whether you should stick with your old patterns or try something different. The most important thing is to concentrate on the quality of your work, whether you move on or not. Your integrity is your most valuable asset."
libra,2011-07-22,"You can be a formidable challenger in any debate now, running circles around your opponent. Nevertheless, you'll still have to be cautious because your behavior is uncharacteristically assertive today and you might inadvertently incite someone's anger. Remember, there's no need to win a battle at this time; it's much healthier to avoid provoking open conflict right from the start. Tone down the rhetoric and channel your inner diplomat."
scorpio,2011-07-22,"You really aren't in the mood to deal with someone else's emotional meltdown today. You don't even have the time or energy to waste on your own melodrama. It's more important for you to complete your work early now so you can get extra rest later in the day. Nevertheless, denying your feelings isn't a sensible road to happiness. Be proactive and share what's going on with others. Express yourself clearly and succinctly without turning it into a three-ring circus."
sagittarius,2011-07-22,"The Moon's visit to your 5th House of Fun and Games puts you into quite a playful mood today. But the Moon's difficult square to emotionally tender Venus can turn a lighthearted moment into a chance to reach new levels of intimacy. You can cut your losses and run, or you can demonstrate your courage by moving in closer and expressing your vulnerability. The choice is yours."
capricorn,2011-07-22,"You feel confident that your methodical approach will help you get what you want today. Thankfully, the Sun's imaginative quintile to your ruling planet Saturn enables you to dream your way to practical success. Nevertheless, it's very important to make a significant decision on your own now and then let others know. The autonomy you gain can make a big difference in your life."
aquarius,2011-07-22,"The energetic Aries Moon buzzing in your 3rd House of Communication raises the ante on each of your current projects. Your life already feels noisier and more chaotic than you prefer today. Although you might try to find some quiet time away from your friends, it's better to change your attitude and find happiness exactly where you are and in exactly what you're doing."
pisces,2011-07-22,"A hasty decision could turn into a real problem now as you contemplate your next move. You feel as if you need to take action right away, spurring you to make a poor choice. Unfortunately, you may have a basic difference of opinion with someone about how you spend money. You can make the best of this situation by talking it out. You might be surprised by the sound advice you receive."
aries,2011-07-23,"Although it's been difficult to reestablish your confidence lately, things are now beginning to improve. Naturally, a shift in your attitude won't occur overnight, but you could feel more positive day by day. Just let the current events unfold while affirming that better times are on the way. Believe it or not, the Sun's entry into your 5th House of Creativity today may be enough to chase away the clouds."
taurus,2011-07-23,"The Moon's return to your sign can put you in touch with your feelings while the Sun's entry into your 4th House of Home and Family turns on the streetlights for your walk down Memory Lane. But there's no use in holding on to childhood perspectives anymore, especially if they reinforce your concerns about scarcity. Remember that the universe is overflowing with unlimited possibilities, so show up with a smile and do what you can to transform your fears into love."
gemini,2011-07-23,"You might overcompensate today and show only your very best side. But your positive attitude could come across as false if you sound blindly optimistic. It's of no value to hide the truth now, even if it's more than you think others can take. Don't get bent out of shape over the wrong things; stick to the facts and let others take responsibility for their reactions."
cancer,2011-07-23,"You might feel relieved as the bright Sun leaves your sign, taking the spotlight off you and allowing you to work quietly behind the scenes. But you don't want too much isolation because the Moon slips into your 11th House of Social Networking today. You wish you could just make up your mind and follow your agenda, but you're being pulled in two totally different directions. Ultimately, you will be happiest if you go with the flow now instead of trying to hang on to the illusion of control."
leo,2011-07-23,"You are naturally resistant to change and may not want to engage with what's coming around the next corner. Nevertheless, your anticipation continues to build now because you know that you're on a new course and can't wait to see where it leads. The Sun's shift into your sign today initiates a highly active phase for the next month. But don't rush the creative process; everything will unfold exactly on time."
virgo,2011-07-23,"You aren't happy if someone is keeping information from you today, but thankfully you can handle the situation skillfully because the willful Sun and trickster Mercury are traveling through your 12th House of Secrets. Even a difficult experience can quickly morph into a positive one if you exude confidence, rather than doubt. You can change the game now by preemptively exploring the hidden realms of your subconscious. Happiness comes from the clues you find buried deep in the shadows."
libra,2011-07-23,"You want to be free of the responsibilities that have been holding you back recently. Fortunately, the brilliant Sun's entry into your 11th House of Friends encourages you to act boldly in social situations. There's no need to panic and take a risk, but creating a sound plan that is followed by decisive action can be an unbeatable combination."
scorpio,2011-07-23,"It's tricky if someone assumes that you will always drop your personal priorities when asked. You wouldn't mind offering your help, but you don't appreciate the pressure of being told what to do. There's no need to say yes and jump right in. Others will get by without you immediately coming to the rescue today. Taking time to consider all your options before responding may be enough of a cue to convey that you don't want anyone to take advantage of your generosity."
sagittarius,2011-07-23,"Perhaps you are dreaming about the future in order to avoid dealing with the promises you made. Your intentions may have been sincere, but your time is running short now and you don't know how you're going to fulfill your obligations. Keep in mind that even the smallest molehills seem like mountains today. Don't make any sudden changes to your overall strategy yet; wait a few days to see how the new landscape takes shape."
capricorn,2011-07-23,"Having faith in yourself is crucial, but too much confidence inflates your ego. Even the most surefooted of you goats can slip if you're moving too fast, and an overabundance of bravado today might be enough to make you careless. Don't give reality a chance to teach you a lesson in humility. You'll reach your ambitious goal if you focus on each step along the way."
aquarius,2011-07-23,"Everyone is playing a part in your movie now that the dramatic Leo Sun is in your 7th House of Others. Unfortunately, you may be growing weary of someone's affected behavior. You crave sincerity and truthfulness, but could feel as if you're currently being shortchanged in your relationships. It will be a lot less stressful if you accept the fact that others are probably giving all that they can. Be appreciative of what you have today, instead of wishing for more."
pisces,2011-07-23,"You would like to have more free time at your disposal today, but you may have already overcommitted yourself in the chore department. Running errands and helping others could prevent you from following your fantasies. But don't complain about your obligations; just doggedly finish what you can. Thankfully, if you apply yourself diligently during the day, you may have time for more pleasurable activities in the evening."
aries,2011-07-24,"You're not ready to settle down now because spontaneous Mars and opportunistic Jupiter have you thinking that your big chance is right around the corner. Unfortunately, your enthusiasm can actually diminish the potential if you push too hard. Going on a long walk or chilling by the pool could help to rebuild your stamina. Don't worry about the big one that gets away; there are plenty of other fish in the sea."
taurus,2011-07-24,"The Moon's visit to your sign now is a sure indication that your feelings are continuing to change. However, beneath your apparent shifting moods there is a steadiness that can be reassuring to those around you. You should be able to hold your position today; just make certain to stay flexible enough to keep your balance."
gemini,2011-07-24,You may believe that you need to hide your emotions today with the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Privacy. But you probably don't have any big secret that must be kept to yourself. It's more about those who aren't as eager to listen to your story. Don't retreat too far if you think you are being rejected. Give others the breathing room they need and remember that your frenetic pace may be overwhelming for someone else at this time.
cancer,2011-07-24,"You need the support of your peers now that the Moon is in your 11th House of Friends. Luckily, everyone seems to come through just in the nick of time. But don't assume that people will simply agree to everything you say, for it's likely they will tell you what they truly think, even if it isn't what you want to hear. Thankfully, what you learn today can be quite useful if you're willing to listen."
leo,2011-07-24,"You could react quite stubbornly today, especially if someone tries to play the authority card. You don't like it when anyone tells you what to do. Avoid the temptation to resist change. Instead of allowing your pride to get in the way now, it's smarter to carry out your appointed tasks and then talk about your annoyance once you are done."
virgo,2011-07-24,"You might think that your plans are well researched and everything is moving along according to schedule. Although your progress looks good, there are still some details to be ironed out. Don't let your current avoidance of work stand between you and your goals. You are tempted to ignore your chores today, so paying attention to procedures can make the difference between success and failure."
libra,2011-07-24,"Deepening your relationships may be more fruitful now than usual as the Moon moves through your 8th House of Intimacy. Thankfully, others bring you the fortitude that you might currently lack. Your friends can help to illuminate your path, reminding you of your true destination. Receiving support from your peers is a powerful boost to your spirit, but it's still up to you to do the work."
scorpio,2011-07-24,"Your friend or partner may act so stubbornly today that you lose your temper. It could be scary if someone's intensity is strong enough to match yours. Unfortunately, this power struggle can turn into a stalemate, unless one of you decides to give a little. Remember, your ability to negotiate and create common ground is an indicator of a healthy ego rather than a sign of weakness. Be strong and bend like a willow."
sagittarius,2011-07-24,"It's no fun doing chores that don't utilize your natural talents. You may feel as if you're trapped by your own promises and wish you could break out of the rut you are in. Although you have a lot you want to do now, it's wise to meet your current obligations to the best of your ability. Ironically, fulfilling your commitments is your most reliable ticket to freedom."
capricorn,2011-07-24,"You can find pleasure in nearly anything you do now, making you more fun to be around. You magically turn a hopelessly boring chore into an act of creation. Others like what they see and want to work or play with you, increasing your enjoyment level even more. Ultimately, today unfolds like a self-fulfilling prophecy; your amazing experience is created by your own positive attitude."
aquarius,2011-07-24,"There's a certain safety in holding on to the past or trying to maintain the status quo. However, it's not healthy to latch on to an old perspective, however secure it seems. Unfortunately, you may not be ready to let it go just yet. Even if you freely admit that you don't have all the answers today, you can still paint yourself into a corner if your thinking is overly rigid. It's okay to entertain other options without any pressure of making a commitment until the time is right."
pisces,2011-07-24,"You may have such a set notion of how the day should play out that you become anxious if there is any deviation from your schedule. The good news is that opportunities abound, but the bad news is that you'll miss them unless you keep an open mind. If you narrow your choices, happiness may be harder to find. Stick to your overall agenda while making necessary adjustments as you go along."
aries,2011-07-25,"At first it seems as if others are telling you to slow down today, but this familiar advice to an impulsive Aries isn't about your speed. The emotional Moon's entry into your interactive 3rd house encourages you to react instinctively, but your intuition can lead you astray now. Although you're tempted to respond right away, it's smarter to deliberate first. Waiting for a while before speaking your piece will make everyone happier and leave you without regret."
taurus,2011-07-25,"You don't want to do anything until you're ready to do it. If someone else attempts to change your timetable, you might overreact. Try softening your position today; it's not helpful if you become so locked into your own schedule that you can't respond rationally to an intriguing opportunity. Accepting an unexpected invitation can bring an exciting social interaction that improves your outlook on the day."
gemini,2011-07-25,"The Moon's entry into multifaceted Gemini can be quite confusing, especially as it raises your feelings closer to the surface. This normally wouldn't be a problem, except it appears that you want contradictory things that might require you to proceed in two different directions. However, you might be more successful by postponing your decision until your mental clarity returns. If you can be comfortable with your ambivalence, then nothing needs to be changed for now."
cancer,2011-07-25,"Your anticipation of the future is likely more intense now than the events that actually follow. However, no matter how you look at it, you're in for significant changes. Don't panic; it may take time to put the big pieces in place. During your preparation process, it's crucial to stay in the present moment and handle each situation as it arises, rather than worrying about what you might have to do tomorrow."
leo,2011-07-25,"You are ready for a bit of fun now, even if you still have plenty of things to do. Keep in mind that it isn't wise to avoid your responsibilities, for they will continue to multiply over the next few days. Grab a bit of enjoyment when you can and then get back to work. It's all too easy to overextend your lunch break, so let the good times roll for a limited amount of time before returning for another round of serious business."
virgo,2011-07-25,"You have a lot to manage today as the Moon moves into your 10th House of Social Responsibility. You want to do things right, but you may get distracted by interesting conversations with unusual people. There's nothing wrong with being curious as long as you're willing to take the time to ask questions in a sensitive manner. However, don't be overly concerned about what others think; just concentrate on your path to success."
libra,2011-07-25,"It's hard to know if you should be jazzed about what's coming next or concerned that you recently missed your chance. You can sense that big changes are lurking just out past your perceptual limits. Nevertheless, you cannot wrap your mind around this elusive situation today. Although you may need to face your anxiety, remaining flexible is more important than following a specific agenda."
scorpio,2011-07-25,"The Moon's shift into your 8th House of Deep Sharing today gives you a chance to dig beneath the surface. However, the lightweight Gemini Moon could still leave you feeling slightly unsatisfied. Pushing too hard can set you up for disappointment now. While others may be able to match your passion, they won't be able to sustain it. Be persistent; your patience will pay off when everyone else catches up with you in the days ahead."
sagittarius,2011-07-25,"You stand to learn something important about yourself when you actually take the time to listen. But you may grow bored of someone else's stories today as the restless Gemini Moon rattles your 7th House of Relationships. It's ironic that another person can get on your nerves, yet also offers such an important lesson. A quick escape is tempting now, but staying present in the dialogue can ultimately change your perspective for the better."
capricorn,2011-07-25,You are easily distracted today and may be unable to stay focused on your work. It's hard to keep your thinking in perspective because your mind is jumping all over the place. Don't try to suppress your runaway thoughts by force. A smarter strategy is to grant yourself permission to ride a carousel of ideas and feelings. Think of this as a mini-getaway; your job responsibilities will be patiently waiting for your return.
aquarius,2011-07-25,"You could be asked to offer your impression about someone you know. But the level of energy it takes to engage in a discussion -- even in just sharing your ideas -- might be more than you want. Your avoidance tactics won't likely be very effective now, so you may as well stop trying to put off the inevitable. A little procrastination is harmless, but too much can lead to unnecessary trouble. Ultimately, it's best to just say what's on your mind."
pisces,2011-07-25,"Your thoughts are running astray today and you can frustrate yourself by thinking that you have the power to rein them in. However, it's possible to calm your nerves by diverting your attention. Watch a movie or just relax to your favorite music. And remember, these distractions are not long-term solutions; they simply shift your focus for a while. Be patient; the nervous energy will run its course and settle down over the next few days."
aries,2011-07-26,"You are naturally inclined to be a pioneer, exploring unknown territories and courageously doing things for the first time. Today's fidgety Gemini Moon encourages you to add even more activities to your already busy schedule. Although you might enjoy running off in several different directions at once, narrowing your focus now and concentrating on one task at a time will enable you to be even more productive."
taurus,2011-07-26,"The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Self-Worth today motivates you to reevaluate your possessions and what they mean to you. A realistic assessment of what you have versus what you need can produce some pretty interesting results. You might realize that it would be easier to get by with less, but are unwilling to make the adjustments necessary to change your lifestyle. Although no immediate action is required, a fresh perspective will do you good."
gemini,2011-07-26,"It's hard for you to decide what's best for you today because the Moon in dualistic Gemini has you seeing double. Even after you have made your choice, a single destination morphs into two distinct possibilities -- just like the many-headed Hydra who grew two heads every time one was cut off. There's no need to answer every question posed to you; some dilemmas are better left unresolved for now."
cancer,2011-07-26,"You have the ability to sound more certain today than you actually feel. Although you may be lost in self-doubt, your co-workers might not realize that you are so unsure of yourself. Ironically, you could receive support from others and be more successful professionally if you share your current concerns with a trusted friend, rather than trying to hide your insecurity. Being honest now really is the best policy."
leo,2011-07-26,"You Lions usually prefer to play in a pack, but today you might want to go your own way. You like the idea of doing things as part of a group, yet you also need to maintain some autonomy or you will feel trapped by the very same people that you want in your life. Don't sacrifice your individuality to be accepted by others because you will likely need more freedom, rather than less, over the next few days."
virgo,2011-07-26,"You might feel as if you're struggling to maintain your sense of purpose today. You have a very clear sense of what you need to do, but circumstances may pull you in several different directions at once. While you prefer to drill down on the details of what you already started, responsibilities demand that you spread yourself thinner to cover the workload. Recognize your limits; staying within them now will make everyone involved happier."
libra,2011-07-26,"You may have grandiose ideas about what you want to do in the future, and adopting a common-sense approach actually enables you to live out your dream. However, this is not an overnight project; your long-range planning might take months to manifest. If you find yourself getting restless now, remember the old adage, ""Rome wasn't built in a day."""
scorpio,2011-07-26,"Sometimes when you dive into an emotional situation, you do so with such intensity that you lose perspective. However, today you're able to be fully involved without being hooked by someone else's melodrama. Your rational approach gives you a cool head now, so others may lean on you even more. It's a gift to share your thoughts as long as you don't attempt to control what happens next."
sagittarius,2011-07-26,"You are a champion at gazing far off into the distance, but not as good sometimes at seeing what's right under your nose. A close friend or partner may attempt to change your perspective by inundating you with information about something that's occurring right now. Unfortunately, you may think that the current events are merely a distraction from your more evolved perspective. Don't be so quick to judge others; instead, be open to what they can teach you in the present moment."
capricorn,2011-07-26,"You may want to talk today instead of doing your work, but too much idle chatter will only lead to trouble. Thankfully, the interactive Gemini Moon's current visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine is stabilized by self-restrained Saturn. Although it's hard for you to settle down now, it becomes easier if you stay focused on your immediate goals. Remember, your actions have more impact than your words."
aquarius,2011-07-26,"You are buzzing with creative ideas today, but all your innovative thinking could be for naught unless you take the time to turn your thoughts into action. However, initiating a new project doesn't ensure automatic success; you must have the necessary persistence to finish whatever you start. Following through with your intentions is possible if you keep your eyes on the distant prize of success."
pisces,2011-07-26,"Although you might like to space out and lose yourself in a daydream today, there's way too much going on for that to realistically happen. You may be drawn from one project to another, without having enough time to settle into any of them. Instead of working yourself up into a state of high anxiety, remember that this level of noise won't last. In the meantime, set your fantasies aside until you have taken care of business."
aries,2011-07-27,"You are in your element today as the Sun in your 5th House of Fun and Games connects with brilliant Uranus in your sign. Instead of doing things in a familiar manner, you are motivated to try something new. Your mind is buzzing with exciting ideas now, and you are itching to see how they translate into the real world. Obviously, you would like to succeed, but you'll be quite satisfied if a good time is had by all."
taurus,2011-07-27,"You have a lot of details to handle today, but you'll probably figure out a way to do something more fun instead. For example, rather than finishing a project you might channel your creativity toward planning an escape from work. Ironically, the craziest ideas are the ones you'll most likely get away with now, so don't be afraid to step outside of the box."
gemini,2011-07-27,"You may get a chance to do something that is not part of your regular routine today, but it will probably turn out differently than you think. Perhaps you are invited to attend a social event, only to discover that your assumptions about those in attendance need to be revised. Fortunately, you are able to shift gears easily and adapt to unusual circumstances. You may be pleasantly surprised as long as you remain open to the unexpected."
cancer,2011-07-27,"You're not thrilled about being thrust into the public eye today, but it's probably a good idea to hide your annoyance. Overcoming your resistance enables you to surprise others with your stellar performance. However, playing your part can bring recognition by your peers or even a raise in pay, so don't say no just because the thought of being on stage makes you feel uncomfortable."
leo,2011-07-27,"This can be a most memorable day for you because you can get away with being as weird as you want. Your need to do something totally outrageous may reach a point of no return today, provoking you to take sudden action. But rather than being sensitive to other people's needs, maverick Uranus connects with the Sun in your sign, encouraging you to do as you wish. Nevertheless, there is still an unspoken boundary. Don't go too far over the edge now or you'll have to spend time later cleaning up the mess you make."
virgo,2011-07-27,"You have something that you need to do at work today and you won't let someone get in your way without putting up a fight. Fortunately, you can emerge as the winner if you are honest about your intentions and don't scatter your energy. Don't think twice about standing up for yourself, even if you would rather avoid conflict. Hopefully, the skirmish will be over quickly and you'll be able to get on with your job once the air is cleared."
libra,2011-07-27,"Unconventional friends can inspire you today because you view them as your ""Get out of Jail Free"" card. You may feel restrained by the current social circumstances, making it difficult for you to escape the boredom of the day. However, it's easier to step out of the box when you're hanging out with people who are innovative, radical and eccentric. Nevertheless, it's a mistake to expect someone else to make your move for you; take a chance and let your freak flag fly."
scorpio,2011-07-27,"You can be the hero who saves the day if you are willing to move beyond your fears and share your unorthodox solution to a problem at work. Although you might expect others to reject your idea because it's so wacky, they may quickly approve because they like how unusual it is. Don't hold your punches now; state your case as clearly as possible and then let go of your attachment to the outcome. You may be pleasantly surprised with the results."
sagittarius,2011-07-27,It's time to resurrect your dreams of taking a holiday to an exotic destination now that the Sun is visiting your 9th House of Travel. Its easy trine to irrepressible Uranus in your 5th House of Play turns an unrealistic fantasy into a reachable goal. You don't need to fill in all the details yet; just declare your intentions and start making plans now. Before you know it you'll be on your way.
capricorn,2011-07-27,"You may need to deal with a few surprises in your personal life now, but ultimately everything should turn out just fine. Your need for stability on the home front runs up against your desire for more personal freedom. Normally, you aren't thrilled by the idea of unexpected change; however, today you are relieved when the stuck energy is finally released. Don't hold on to old fears because they will only stand in the way of your potential happiness."
aquarius,2011-07-27,"Your key planet Uranus forms a superconductive trine with the Sun in your 7th House of Partnerships today, electrifying your communication. You have an opportunity to express yourself in a way that might reveal a part of you that you have been hiding. Fortunately, a relationship can be strengthened now when you take a risk and share what's in your heart, even if your feelings are radical. Don't hold back; this is a chance for you to be uniquely you."
pisces,2011-07-27,"An exciting breakthrough at work is possible today and it could ultimately affect your finances in a positive way. You have an excess of innovative ideas now that you can bring to the job. But don't waste time making plans or telling others what you intend to do. Your intuitive channels are wide open, so get busy and follow your instincts."
aries,2011-07-28,"Romance may be in the air as sweet Venus dances into your 5th House of Love today. However, circumstances may prevent you from acting on your feelings. Be careful, for your emotions can lead you astray if you let your imagination run wild. Rely on the facts now and not your intuition; cool logic will keep you on track."
taurus,2011-07-28,"You're likely to withhold your feelings today, unless you feel safe enough to let down your guard. Your key planet Venus moves into your 4th House of Security, indicating that you may find more pleasure in the comfort of your own home. Nevertheless, current circumstances could keep you busier than you want to be now. You might not be able to change everything to your liking, but little adjustments throughout the day can make you happy."
gemini,2011-07-28,"Your key planet Mercury becomes very picky today as it enters critical Virgo, challenging you to limit your communication to practical issues. Although you may desire to keep the flow of information moving along, you are required to slow things down so you have time to process what is happening. Ultimately, you must make priorities and decide which interactions are useful and which ones can be eliminated."
cancer,2011-07-28,"Your self-esteem is on the upswing now that charming Venus is in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. You want to be noticed and are eager for others to appreciate you. However, it may be harder for you to put your feelings into words. Instead of talking about yourself today, process your emotions on your own and then share your inner journey once you've had time to think about it for a while."
leo,2011-07-28,"Others may find you more alluring today as adorable Venus shifts into outgoing Leo and your 1st House of Personality. The idea of indulging yourself sounds so tempting now that you might even consider skipping out on your responsibilities. Unfortunately, this strategy is not a good idea since the backlash at work could be more intense than you expect. Thankfully, you will still be able to find pleasure later after you meet your obligations."
virgo,2011-07-28,"Your brain shifts into high gear as your key planet Mercury enters orderly Virgo. Your senses are sharp and your thinking is clear. Nevertheless, you can still be distracted by your fantasies now, especially if there's currently someone in your life who is showing interest in you. Instead of wasting precious time pursuing unrealistic dreams, be rational and do what makes the most sense."
libra,2011-07-28,"Your key planet Venus enters your 11th House of Friends and Associates today, emphasizing your involvement with others at work and in the community. Fortunately, it's even easier now for you to get along with nearly anyone because you can see unrealized potential wherever you look. However, your current success may require you to keep your thoughts to yourself, so think carefully about what you're going to say before you start to speak."
scorpio,2011-07-28,"You may be a little bent out of shape today because you don't feel as if your friends really understand you. Even if you make a point to tell them about your inner process, they still might jump to the wrong conclusions. Nevertheless, expressing your opinion is better than keeping it to yourself now. Don't force the issue; those who care the most will eventually appreciate what you shared."
sagittarius,2011-07-28,"You are on the lookout for a travel partner or a playmate now that friendly Venus has entered your 9th House of Adventure. But even if you are alone, this is an ideal time to plan a vacation or take a quick summer getaway. However, you will need to be careful about how much you disclose today because other people's expectations may not match up with your desires. Share what you must, but keep your most personal thoughts to yourself."
capricorn,2011-07-28,"Relationships may feel like they're playing out on a battleground now, especially if your needs are unrecognized by someone you love. Instead of confronting your fears and asking for what you want, you're tempted to retreat into the safety of your own world. There's nothing wrong with taking time to sort out your feelings. Fortunately, communication grows easier over the next few days, enabling you to resolve the current stress."
aquarius,2011-07-28,"Romantic Venus enters your 7th House of Partnerships today, sweetening interactions between you and someone special. Although you can fire up a new relationship or refuel an old one, it's not all fun and games now. There may be underlying tensions that prevent you from feeling fully satisfied. Communication is the essential element. Don't give up; the breakthrough you are seeking might be just around the corner."
pisces,2011-07-28,"It may feel as if you Fish are swimming in a different ocean today, even though you're still in the very same waters. Your current disorientation makes it challenging to balance your starry-eyed idealism with a more practical approach to life. Don't rely on others to tell you what's real because talkative Mercury in your 7th House of Companions allows them to sound more definitive than they really are now. Analyze the facts as best you can and decide for yourself."
aries,2011-07-29,"You're ready to get down to business today, even if only in preparation for the weekend. You may feel quite confident that you'll be able to accomplish the tasks that are on your list. Unfortunately, it's challenging to stay focused on your work; you can't help wishing you could spend time daydreaming about more creative pursuits. Nevertheless, you'll be rewarded for what you do rather than for what you think."
taurus,2011-07-29,"No matter how carefully you choose your words today, there is still room for your friends to misinterpret what you say. You might think that you're being quite specific, yet others still seem to miss the point. It could be that you need more time to develop your ideas, even though you may not realize it yet. Cut yourself some slack and unfold your perspective slowly and carefully. You don't need to be in such a hurry."
gemini,2011-07-29,"You may be confused by the directions you receive from your boss at work today. Everything may be spelled out in great detail, but you want to know how it integrates with the big picture before carrying out your job. Although it's not easy for you to stop asking questions, it may be smarter now to do exactly as instructed without trying to understand how the pieces of the puzzle fit together."
cancer,2011-07-29,"You're still in a rather meditative mood today, but even your daydreams seem to lose focus. It's as if you're under a spell that prevents you from seeing things as they truly are now. However, you have the ability to conjure up an ideal situation and then step into it by using your imagination. Although this may not be helpful for making practical decisions, it's quite useful for creative pursuits."
leo,2011-07-29,"Something weird is happening today and you may not be able to put your finger on it. Nevertheless, you are drawn toward looking beyond the obvious in the hope of finding magic hiding in the shadows. Too much searching might actually distract you from the beauty that's right under your nose. For now, the devil may really be in the details."
virgo,2011-07-29,"You can cleverly embellish your story so much today that others think you're telling the truth. However, you're less worried about the facts now than you are in keeping people interested in your story. There's nothing wrong with letting your imagination run wild as long as you practice full disclosure, so everyone knows that you're only telling a tall tale or just sharing a dream."
libra,2011-07-29,"It makes more sense for you to be a follower today rather than a leader, even if you have a specific goal in mind. You can certainly turn on the charm now in order to get someone's attention, but it may be tougher to maintain the authority that it takes to be in charge. There's no shame in letting someone else be the boss while you relinquish control and recharge your batteries."
scorpio,2011-07-29,"You can express your feelings or present your ideas in a very seductive way today. Even if someone isn't interested at first, you can draw them into your story by conjuring up mythical images and fantastic characters. Once you have others listening to you, you can pull them in even further. However, subtle manipulation of the facts can lead to trouble, especially if you're motivated by fear or greed. It's safer to simply stick with the facts and be yourself."
sagittarius,2011-07-29,"You have the ability to inspire others today with your wonderful ideas and your carefully chosen words. Your gift of gab enables you to string together ideas as if they were pearls on a necklace. But weaving too many threads of thought into an enchanting tapestry of concepts can become overly complicated, leaving others confused instead of motivated. Although you're tempted to act the role of the muse, it's better to play it safe now and be pragmatic rather than poetic."
capricorn,2011-07-29,"If you are thinking about furthering your education, this is a great time to nail down some of the details. Fortunately, you have the patience now to focus on the specifics without losing sight of the big picture. However, you need to be careful that you don't concentrate your efforts in the wrong direction. Making preliminary decisions today is a good idea, but, if possible, it's best to leave some options on the table for a few weeks."
aquarius,2011-07-29,"You may have unrealistic expectations about an investment or a large purchase that involves others. Ultimately, you could make money or acquire something of value, but you need to take extra time and separate your hopes from what's really happening. You could easily get swept up in someone's idealism today and believe everything you are told. Diligently checking the facts is not just a good idea now; it's absolutely necessary."
pisces,2011-07-29,"You are quite receptive to other people's ideas now, making you more susceptible to deception. Although it's harder to tell the difference between reality and your fantasies today, mischievous Mercury's opposition to seductive Neptune doesn't mean that you'll be led down a garden path. This aspect can inspire your spirituality, revitalize your creativity and increase your fascination with music and art. Just don't say yes too quickly or you may regret it."
aries,2011-07-30,"The Leo New Moon is your ticket to fun, especially if you have scheduled an enjoyable activity for the day. You might think that you should take charge because you know what's going on, but you won't get far before realizing that your fantasies have overtaken reality. If it's too late to hand over the reins to someone else, just focus on the present moment and do the best you can."
taurus,2011-07-30,"The Leo New Moon activates your 4th House of Roots, encouraging you to tend your home garden now. You don't need to go off in search of adventure because an idea that you have today can grow and eventually take you far. However, a significant journey to a distant shore begins with making a plan, acquiring resources and preparing for your trip. You're not ready to leave yet, so use your time wisely while you have it available."
gemini,2011-07-30,"There's no need to make a fuss about your current activities today, even if you're trying to get others to notice. Your friends may slow you down by placing demands on your time if you draw unnecessary attention to yourself. Be smart and turn on your cloaking device (or just lay low for a bit) so you can get on with your plans instead of being distracted by everyone else's expectations."
cancer,2011-07-30,"The Leo New Moon in your 2nd House of Money today emphasizes the importance of how you handle a financial matter. Fortunately, you can prevent a problem before it even starts by taking strategic action right away. However, if you miss your window of opportunity, a manageable situation could blossom into a multifaceted monster that leads to more complications than solutions."
leo,2011-07-30,Today's Leo New Moon is a harbinger of important changes that are occurring in your life. You don't have to wait for something to happen now; add new activities to your schedule that can bring out the best in you. But don't try to accomplish too much too fast because shaking up your life isn't necessary now. Moving slowly and deliberately is okay as long as you get something started while the energy is still fresh.
virgo,2011-07-30,"You are brimming with ideas, but it may be smart to keep them to yourself as long as you can. Although gabby Mercury is in your sign now, it's not useful to talk about your new project yet because your message could be misunderstood today. Get started on your own, without anyone else's involvement; you can always connect with supportive allies later on."
libra,2011-07-30,"You may be trying to find a middle ground today as you weigh your dreams against your more practical concerns. It might feel as if you don't have much of a choice in a complicated interpersonal matter, but no one can control your inner world. Feeding your fantasies with your attention can be just what you need to prevent yourself from falling into a boring rut. Even if you have mundane duties to perform, you are still free to escape within your mind."
scorpio,2011-07-30,"The proud Leo New Moon falls in your 10th House of Status, allowing others to see how passionate you are about your success. Thankfully, you don't have to do anything special; your no-bull attitude and determined work ethic is what impresses your friends. Still, you may be uncertain about your next move. Concentrate on your destination, for what you do today will set the tone for the next couple of weeks."
sagittarius,2011-07-30,"Today's bold Leo New Moon activates your 9th House of Faraway Places. This lunar position stimulates your imagination and increases your wanderlust, even if you have set aside your globetrotting desires for a while. Naturally, a weekend off isn't enough time to explore the Antarctic or trek across Europe. Fortunately, you can still aim high while visualizing your ideal journey. You could even begin with simply learning more about your geographical area of interest."
capricorn,2011-07-30,"You might be tested by today's expressive Leo New Moon's presence in your 8th House of Regeneration. A relationship that's already stressed could require your immediate attention, but there's no reason to fret. You have an opportunity to set things right by reframing the situation. Transforming your perspective lessens the pressure and enables positive change to enter your life."
aquarius,2011-07-30,"Today's outgoing Leo New Moon brightens your 7th House of Partners. Fresh waves of energy could quickly reinvigorate a failing relationship or even heat up a new one. Nevertheless, you won't be satisfied with just feeling good now because you are inspired by your own high ideals. Go ahead and reach for something that's previously been unattainable. Take a chance, but don't be too self-critical if you miss the mark. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
pisces,2011-07-30,"Showing up to do your chores with a smile might be half the work today with the Leo New Moon's visit to your 6th House of Routine. You may prefer to sleep late and start your errands even later, but it's a much smarter strategy to bounce out of bed and show everyone what you can do now. Nevertheless, grabbing the spotlight won't help you receive the recognition you want. Working diligently on the sidelines will hasten your success as those in charge realize exactly what you're doing."
aries,2011-07-31,You may think that you have all the ingredients to whip up the perfect plan for your pet project today. You feel positive because you believe that your vision is clear and you know how to reach your destination. But your confidence may be covering up a sneaking suspicion that you're missing an important piece of information that could change everything. It's wise to entertain unknown scenarios now. Too much rigidity will make it harder to create the future you want.
taurus,2011-07-31,"You can get quickly bent out of shape today if you think that your extra effort isn't making things happen faster. You may even wonder why you're working so hard to get everything done when no one else seems to care. Even if you're frustrated by the snail's pace at which everything appears to be happening now, don't let your annoyance create a meltdown. Fortunately, if you take a deep breath you should be able to connect with your inner patience, making it easier to settle into the current flow."
gemini,2011-07-31,"Everything may appear just fine as your day unfolds according to your plans. However, something may seem a bit off even if you have a positive attitude. It's as if you cannot find a sustainable pace now. Still, it makes sense to keep your concerns to yourself. Letting your fantasies run wild can be quite amusing, but sharing them with anyone else today could stir up trouble."
cancer,2011-07-31,"It's much easier to get your work finished if you responded to last week's distractions by addressing the issues raised, rather than just temporarily diverting them. But if similar topics resurface, concentrate your attention on resolving them and stick to the process until you know that the energy has played out. Retreating prematurely will just create more problems down the road."
leo,2011-07-31,"As the Moon ambles through your proud sign now, you may grow more theatrical in your personal expression. You can even become so enchanted by your own intensity that you momentarily forget that you are just one of the players in a complex set of circumstances. Step away from the spotlight and start asking questions about what you can do to broaden your overall perspective."
virgo,2011-07-31,"Handling your responsibilities quickly will lead you in the right direction now. You want to meet your obligations as efficiently as you can, but may be uncertain about the best approach. Remember, your emotional well-being is tied to how productive you feel today. Plan your day carefully and don't be afraid to make use of the people and resources that are at your disposal."
libra,2011-07-31,"You want to show your friends how much they mean to you now, but everything you do feels contrived and somehow misses the mark. It's easier to concentrate on doing your job well, and forget about trying to impress others. An unexpected reward may yet come your way as long as you get your work finished before you run out of time."
scorpio,2011-07-31,"Shifting gears to plan your next career move now may not be as easy as you wish. Fortunately, you feel confident and strong enough to manage the pressures of change without letting anyone know that you are struggling. Revealing your vulnerability by admitting that you can't do everything by yourself can actually create opportunities to have positive discussions and muster up the heartwarming support you need."
sagittarius,2011-07-31,"You are dreaming of distant horizons now that the Moon is visiting your 9th House of Faraway Places. But reaching your destination may be more complicated than simply heading off in the right direction. Luckily, with a little extra effort today you can organize your life so it resonates with your larger goals. Think small at first and tend the seeds of your ideas until they grow into a strategic action plan."
capricorn,2011-07-31,"A relationship with a powerful person can have more impact on your future than you want to admit. This is not the best day to ignore a problem, for it won't just go away on its own now. Push your buried anger out into the open so it can't fester any longer in the dark. After the air is clear of judgment, everyone is likely to feel optimistic and more willing to invest in your success."
aquarius,2011-07-31,"The Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions reflects your heightened sensitivity to other people's moods today. You seem to know what someone wants before anyone else does, but you still might not be compassionate enough to lose yourself in service. Don't be too self-critical if you want something just for yourself. You deserve having your needs met, too."
pisces,2011-07-31,"The extroverted Leo Moon is now visiting your 6th House of Habits, encouraging you to take a chance and break out of an old routine. Meanwhile, you may be disheartened if you realize that you can't satisfy your need for adventure. Fortunately, you'll be better prepared to make your escape later on if you focus on every little detail that confronts you today."
aries,2011-08-01,"You might not take the time to think about your future security because you assume that your financial situation will improve soon. However, you should be careful because you could needlessly waste money when everything looks good. You may wish that you didn't spend so much today when you're not so flush later on. There's nothing wrong with having fun as long as you don't go over your limit. Money can't buy you happiness."
taurus,2011-08-01,"You may be very fixed in your naive belief that everything will turn out well, prompting you to let some important business slide today. You can positively impact your life by thinking that your dreams will come true, but you still must pay attention to observing limits or you might face unpleasant consequences. There's a lot at stake now, so don't bet your success on the notion that everything will somehow improve on its own in the future. Apply yourself diligently in the present moment to slant the odds in your favor."
gemini,2011-08-01,"Changes in your relationships at work may cause you some concern, but your worry fades when you see that the dark clouds have silver linings. It's invigorating when you realize that whatever is stuck needs to move to make room for positive change. Although you can't see the details of your future, you know it's better than what's going on now. Don't finalize your plans yet; it's better to live with uncertainty for a few more days."
cancer,2011-08-01,"You like the idea of being part of a team now, but you don't want to sacrifice your values just to be accepted. Fortunately, you are able to stay connected with the group, even if your goals ultimately differ from theirs. You can have your cake and eat it too as long as you remember to practice the art of inclusion. You don't have to withdraw to be yourself. Others will appreciate you just the way you are."
leo,2011-08-01,"You may be extremely excited now that sweet Venus in your sign is connecting with electric Uranus. Happily, there is great potential everywhere you look. However, all that glitters is not gold. You cannot turn every possibility into a winner. Keep in mind that you won't be able to sustain your current optimism forever, so conserve your resources and work to make an opportunity pay off soon."
virgo,2011-08-01,"You are humming with anticipation today, for you can see how the present moment holds the precious seeds for fantastic things to come. Unfortunately, events are moving quickly, increasing your anxiety, even if the challenge is also very exciting. Naturally, you want to be happy, but may be scared that whatever good happens now won't last. You can ensure a better outcome if you build slowly and methodically on a strong foundation."
libra,2011-08-01,"Your best shot at happiness today comes as a total surprise, so set aside your previous agenda and be ready for something cool to happen. Instead of doing everything the same old way, take a break from your regular routine. Habitual patterns may be reassuring, but can also limit your opportunities. Acting spontaneously now could lead you to a truly memorable experience."
scorpio,2011-08-01,"An unexpected event can turn your day upside down. Even if you planned to spend a simple day at work, things could get out of hand quickly. Resistance is futile; don't try to control what happens today. If you fearfully attempt to go back to the way things were, you could miss out on a lot of fun."
sagittarius,2011-08-01,"Your life seems to be undergoing rapid change and you're thrilled with the notion of riding the currents wherever they take you. You have no idea where the tides are carrying you, yet you're eager to head out on this great adventure, anyway. Don't assume that you're really ready to leave just because everything looks good. Taking your time to put everything in order now will ensure that you'll actually reach your destination."
capricorn,2011-08-01,"You may need to regain control by slowing down or you could be forced to use your emergency brake to temporarily stop everything. Unfortunately, these tactics won't likely bring you the stability you now seek. Additionally, letting your fears influence your decisions is a big mistake and could sour a perfectly wonderful situation. Luckily, you're not in any danger as long as you continue to flow with the current energy."
aquarius,2011-08-01,"This is an exciting day because charming Venus is harmonizing with your key planet Uranus. You are looking good and feeling even better. For now, you're the one who's able to navigate through the stormy weather, so others may come to you for advice and leadership. Do not give them the party line. Your friends might not want to hear the truth, but your eclectic perspective is more valuable than telling them what they want to hear."
pisces,2011-08-01,"Your traditional planet Jupiter squares the Sun today to fill your sails with the winds of change. You are charged up and raring to go, but things get tricky because you may not have a destination in mind yet. Your confidence is soaring and you know you'll reach your goals -- if you could only decide what you want to do. Slow down and give yourself time to reconsider your priorities before you find yourself drifting aimlessly out to sea."
aries,2011-08-02,"All your senses are on red alert today and your acute perceptions register every single nuance in your immediate environment. Unfortunately, you could be so sensitive now that you start noticing things that aren't actually there. Be careful with your judgments about what is real; you might be making up stories to justify what's in your imagination without even realizing it."
taurus,2011-08-02,"Your friends and associates seem to be out of step with the rest of the world while you are marching to the beat of a reliable drummer today. The Moon and Mercury are in fellow earth sign Virgo, helping you maintain a steady pace, even if fleet-footed Mercury screeches to a halt. Unfortunately, you can easily work yourself into an anxious state if you try to complete everything in front of you. Don't rush; do what you do well and practice patience with yourself and others."
gemini,2011-08-02,"Your key planet Mercury turns retrograde today, emphasizing many forms of exchange, including verbal interactions, written correspondence and monetary transactions. You think that you are being very clever, but might discover that you only outsmarted yourself. Being mentally agile is a useful trait, but now it's more useful to stick with the plan. Don't let your curiosity tempt you to search for solutions to problems that haven't even surfaced yet."
cancer,2011-08-02,"You have already looked over your daily calendar enough times to realize that there's no easy way to fit in everything today. You must face the facts and decide what needs to be eliminated. Unfortunately, talking about your current perspective may be a lot easier than actually narrowing it. Still, you will feel much better after you postpone a few things on your current schedule and kindly explain that it's just not possible for you to do so much at this time."
leo,2011-08-02,"You may be losing momentum at work and fears begin to surface about your long-term financial security. Although you're ready to shore up your cash flow, it could take longer than you realize to put everything back in order. Still, you're ready to take action because you don't want money issues to become more problematic in the weeks ahead. Remember, there's no need to spend what you don't have just to keep up appearances. It's more important to get back to basics so you can make it all work out."
virgo,2011-08-02,"You are struggling as you consider two divergent approaches to life with the Moon in your practical sign while Mars is in noisy Gemini. You might try to limit the amount of data you need to handle now, but the information keeps coming. Thankfully, you can manage the situation by remaining open-minded while sorting through the details later. Don't waste time trying to figure out what's right; the answers will come to you organically on their own."
libra,2011-08-02,"You feel as if others are pressuring you to complete a project today, but your current deadlines don't make any sense at all. Unfortunately, you might have a hard time tying up loose ends. The more you work, the less finished it seems. Overreacting isn't helpful; just do the absolute best you can and then quit stressing out. If something has to fall behind, let it go without resistance. You can do more harm than good if you hurry up and rush your work."
scorpio,2011-08-02,"You may need to make time for a serious relationship discussion with a close friend or partner. However, you might find yourself having a rerun of a recent conversation. You're not interested in looking back now because you want to see forward movement. Be patient and remember that you're in a holding pattern for the next few weeks. You'll have time to express yourself later on down the road."
sagittarius,2011-08-02,"You are growing concerned that your life is heading into a serious roadblock. Actually, you may be forced to change directions if you're not willing to slow down considerably. There's no need for an immediate decision today, but the sooner you begin discussing your fears with someone you trust, the faster you'll be able to regain a clear perspective."
capricorn,2011-08-02,"You may be very thankful that you have a plan now, even if it will take a while to put it all into motion. When Mercury turns retrograde today, you're ready to dig in your heels and be serious about reaching your destination. You excel at calculating how to act to get what you want, especially if long-range goals are involved. Nevertheless, gaining control of your day will actually help you gain more control of your life."
aquarius,2011-08-02,"You may feel like you have a bit of deep magic at your disposal today, yet it's not yours to use for personal gain. But answers are more likely to come to you through dreams now, instead of rational logic, so don't seek solutions through the usual channels. Although your words might backfire on you, using images and employing symbolic gestures can strongly impact the outcome of your work."
pisces,2011-08-02,"You may feel like a Fish out of water with the Moon in dry Virgo and Mercury turning retrograde in your 7th House of Others. You long for deeper personal connections in your life, but your friends seem to be more emotionally reserved than you prefer. Fortunately, your imagination may hold the keys to the kingdom, but it's easy to get confused by everything you don't yet understand. Don't push too hard for answers; be content with what you know for now and let the rest come in its own time."
aries,2011-08-03,"You may be more considerate of other people's feelings now that your ruling planet Mars is visiting nurturing Cancer. Mars harmonizes with mystical Neptune, giving you the ability to turn your dreams into reality if you stay true to yourself. Remember, the key to your current magic comes from speaking the truth and walking your talk. Don't be shy; say what you want, but at least find the nicest way to do it before you open your mouth."
taurus,2011-08-03,"You may be weary of friends and associates who mislead you with clever words and smooth promises. You're not in the mood to be messed with today and if you think that others are avoiding their responsibilities, you can become quite angry. You won't be any fun to be around if you discover that someone has deceived you in any manner. Try to postpone an important discussion for a few days or you might create more problems than you solve."
gemini,2011-08-03,"Although things may settle down when Mars leaves your sign today, your mind is still quite busy. However, someone may not be playing fairly now and you are worried about how this situation could develop over the days ahead. Don't waste valuable energy by allowing yourself to slip into a fearful state; instead, concentrate your thoughts on spreading love in every moment of the day."
cancer,2011-08-03,"Red-hot Mars pushes into your sign today to fire up your feelings. Unfortunately, your emotional reactions can be strong, possibly making you afraid to share your desires with most people because you're worried that you might scare them away. But total inaction can lead to more problems, so don't go quiet and just pretend that all is well. Let a trusted friend or companion know what's bothering you, but be extra careful not to place blame on anyone for your current worries."
leo,2011-08-03,"You may be attached to your desires, yet unable to bring them out into the open today. Others expect you to be upfront and now there could be trouble if they can tell you're hiding something. Unfortunately, this could lead to someone's accusations and your denials, wasting energy and leaving you frustrated. Be courageous and proudly admit your feelings. You may be uncertain at first, but revealing what you've been hiding can clear the air better than any other strategy."
virgo,2011-08-03,"You can't decide what to do today because you feel off balance. Fortunately, your intentions are probably honorable because you truly want to do the right thing. But even the simplest idea seems to be entangled with other ones, making everything overly complicated. Your actions may even be misinterpreted. Luckily, this is a temporary condition, so cool your jets for a few days until the peace and quiet returns."
libra,2011-08-03,"You might consider withdrawing today so you can focus on taking care of your own needs. However, you're taunted by outrageous fantasies because they seem quite possible. You're tempted to push the limits of logic by acting out an impossible dream sequence, only to discover that it works. Nevertheless, you're treading on unstable ground because the tiniest doubt could cause your entire dreamworld to collapse. Remember, your unwavering belief may be enough to make something special come true."
scorpio,2011-08-03,"Sharing your deepest concerns is not a wise idea today, especially if there isn't anyone around that you sufficiently trust. However, in your search for a confidant you could find yourself attracted to someone else's perspective, believing that it can offer you safe harbor. Unfortunately, impulsive decisions made while you're excited will probably lead you away from your goals. Instead, take the necessary time to work through your uncertainty before giving your final answer."
sagittarius,2011-08-03,"Someone might catch you off guard today as he or she tap dances around your probing questions. You would like to be able to trust your instincts, but others won't likely sit still long enough for you to get a read on what's happening. Wait a few days until the mysterious and the unknowable situation plays through. Thankfully, you could be left with newfound clarity and purpose."
capricorn,2011-08-03,"Some people can become a real pain in the neck now that combative Mars is shifting into your 7th House of Relationships. You may feel as if others are worrying about the wrong things, but you can't say a word about it because the issue is so sensitive. Naturally, you don't want to walk around on eggshells because you realize that you're going to break a few sooner than later. Nevertheless, it's still sensible to avoid direct confrontation for now."
aquarius,2011-08-03,"You don't know if your current assessment of someone is valid or if you're forming it on assumptions that are built upon your desires. Thankfully, you may be able to jumpstart yourself into motion. Your flexibility helps to alleviate the anxious pressure of growing tension in a relationship or partnership. But don't diffuse the uncomfortable energy too quickly. Holding your position and sinking deeper into it should bring you more clarity and meaning than running off to the next situation."
pisces,2011-08-03,"You know that you should be more practical today, but you're frustrated because you cannot seem to control your emotions. It feels as if mysterious forces are coercing you to take action on a project, even if your heart isn't in it. Rationally, you understand what others are telling you, but it doesn't alter your passions. Do what's necessary to satisfy someone's expectations, but do not ignore the important messages that are coming from within."
aries,2011-08-04,"Although something might have gone awry in a relationship recently, it simply may be due to a breakdown in communication. Unfortunately, a disagreement could arise if the other person cannot understand your point of view. You could even be accused of being negative because you want to talk about an uncomfortable subject. Fortunately, there's no need for complete resolution now; bring up your thoughts and then let them go. You can return to the discussion when your partner is ready to engage in the conversation."
taurus,2011-08-04,"You may not get the practical results you want today, but you're still able to rationalize your behavior. You might need to stretch a bit, but you can learn new ways to manage a recurring situation at work. Although you would be happier if you changed how you prioritize your responsibilities, it's less effort to keep things the way they are. Nevertheless, push through your resistance and plan for the future without looking back."
gemini,2011-08-04,"The Moon's visit to your 5th House of Fun and Games is dampened by her run-in with somber Saturn. Although you may be able to recover your lighthearted attitude later in the day, you could have a hard lesson to learn along the way. Thankfully, quicksilver Mercury's alignment with assertive Mars gives you the energy to say what needs to be said. Once the air is cleared, you'll be able to get back to business as normal."
cancer,2011-08-04,"Your words pack more power than you realize today as warrior Mars in your sign lends assistance to clever Mercury in your 3rd House of Communication. Your mental agility, combined with a strong conviction in your beliefs, is an unbeatable recipe for success. You can sell anything now, as long as your heart is in it. Decide what matters most and then get busy asking for the support you need to make it happen."
leo,2011-08-04,"This is an action-packed day that can bring you closer to what you want if you're willing to walk your talk. The words flow off your tongue easily when you tell others about your dreams. But idle chatter is cheap, so it's crucial to galvanize your thoughts into actions. However, your current interactions must be in line with your plans or nothing will seem to gain traction; when your behavior is aligned with your passion, anything is possible."
virgo,2011-08-04,"The Moon's visit to your 2nd House of Resources reminds you to get your money's worth from every financial transaction today. Unfortunately, meeting your basic needs may be more complicated than it appears at first. Look beneath the surface for a missing piece of information that could have significant consequences before signing an agreement or handing over any cash. And most importantly, be clear with your intentions and precise with your words or things could get muddled quickly."
libra,2011-08-04,"You may have a lot of good ideas that all seem worth pursuing today, but you cannot possibly turn every inspirational flash into immediate action. Instead of trying to do too many things at once, be smart and write down your most innovative thoughts. Since they are transitory, even the most brilliant one could fade back into the depths of your unconscious. You can create a plan now and put it into motion once you have the chance."
scorpio,2011-08-04,"Today you might be able to clear up a problem that has been bothering you for a while. Nevertheless, trickster Mercury still has a wild card up his sleeve, so you could inadvertently outsmart yourself by mixing up your facts. Although you're not normally inclined toward sloppy thinking, you're so concerned with getting the right answers that you could stumble. Watch your step; everything should work out if you pay careful attention to the difference between truth and illusion."
sagittarius,2011-08-04,"The socially astute Libra Moon in your 11th House of Friends encourages you to act graciously, but unresolved issues could sneak in amidst the congenial gestures. Unfortunately, you can't tell if a topic is significant enough to address or if it's only a temporary frustration that intensifies a problem. Thankfully, you can take the course of least resistance now so leave the heavy lifting for some other day."
capricorn,2011-08-04,"You may feel as if you're running around in circles without accomplishing very much. You might even revisit the very same issues over and over again. Fortunately, you are able to change the dynamics by discussing your concerns with a friend. Participating in a conversation about your goals allows others to support you in your efforts and helps you break out of the vicious cycle."
aquarius,2011-08-04,"Your ability to imagine the future is heightened by the Moon's presence in your 9th House of Long-Term Goals. Your self-assuredness encourages others to seek out your approval of what they are doing. Although you like being asked for your opinion, you're not sure why anyone thinks you know enough to offer advice now. Save the self-questioning for some other day and just help out however you can."
pisces,2011-08-04,"Your imagination is running the show now and you are eager to share your current inspiration. Although you may feel secure within the context of your life, Mercury's retrograde still makes it tricky to say what's on your mind. Just remember that the more generous you are with others, the better it will be for everyone involved."
aries,2011-08-05,"Your willpower is strong today, but your ""won't power"" may be flagging. You might not be thinking clearly if you're attracted to someone or something, so it's wise to take things slowly. Your overconfidence can land you in trouble if you don't take time to fill in all the details. A more mature approach will pay off now, making it smarter to let the waves of excitement settle down prior to initiating action."
taurus,2011-08-05,"You would rather say yes than no because your ruling planet Venus is being encouraged by overindulgent Jupiter. One scoop of ice cream isn't enough; if something tastes good now, you want more. Unfortunately, your responsibilities may come second if you're distracted by the all-consuming pursuit of happiness. Remember, real joy comes from being satisfied with what you have and not from partaking in sensory overload."
gemini,2011-08-05,You can talk yourself into nearly anything today because your vivid imagination is running on overdrive. You could underestimate the complexity of a job while convincing yourself that it will be really easy. Being cautious enables you to avoid the disappointment that comes from promising more than you can deliver. It's better to be realistic than to commit to a deadline you won't be able to keep.
cancer,2011-08-05,"You are tempted to overspend while buying something you don't really need today. Or, perhaps, a social activity lures you into a situation that costs more than you expect. Either way, you cannot justify the cost of a fleeting pleasure. Being reasonable about your finances may not be fun in the moment, but will go a long way toward building the security you want."
leo,2011-08-05,"You believe that pleasure is just around the corner, but you might have a warped perspective of the future now. On the positive side, your confidence helps to improve your life by increasing your self-esteem. Having faith in what you do can be an important key to your current happiness, assuming that you don't lose touch with reality. Visualizing your ideal outcome is more effective if you apply some common sense along the way."
virgo,2011-08-05,"You are tempted to throw all caution to the wind and risk your current security for the possibility of greater pleasure. Unfortunately, your eagerness to experience something wonderful can lead to an awkward situation when you realize that the fulfillment of your desires won't necessarily bring you long-term satisfaction. Instead of taking a chance for a fleeting moment of fun, concentrate on doing something that will last."
libra,2011-08-05,"You can run out on your responsibilities today if you get caught up in a social whirlwind. Although there are opportunities to play with your friends and partake in thrilling activities, don't forget your previous promises. Instead of floating off into the land of fun and games, keep yourself tethered to the world of more mundane events. If you avoid your obligations, it will certainly be more difficult to reach your goals. Finish your work quickly so you can fully enjoy yourself later on."
scorpio,2011-08-05,"It's hard to know what's acceptable and what's not when asking for something that you need today. Your requests aren't that outrageous, but your friends may not share the same intensity for your passions now that the Moon is back in your sign. Keep in mind that there's no right and wrong when connecting with your feelings, even if you think that you should keep your desires hidden. Instead of slipping into denial, just tone down your style a bit."
sagittarius,2011-08-05,"You may believe that self-indulgent behavior will bring you more joy now, but following this strategy will more likely lead to frustration. Unrestrained partying and other kinds of escapist activities can be a great deal of fun for a short amount of time. Meanwhile, getting serious about seeking your own personal vision requires hard work with the potential rewards to follow sometime in the indefinite future. Ultimately, the choice is yours."
capricorn,2011-08-05,"You've been doing your job under pressure recently, so it shouldn't be a surprise if you're ready to escape from your heavy work responsibilities. Taking a long lunch or socializing on the clock isn't the problem, but your break will end abruptly if you're caught stretching the limits. Fortunately, you should be able to fit in some fun as long as you don't attempt to get away with more than your fair share."
aquarius,2011-08-05,"You may be more interested in facilitating someone else's pleasure than seeking satisfaction for yourself today. Ironically, your generosity can be lots of fun for you, too, but taking anything too far now will interfere with getting good results. Fortunately, you can create a situation where all participants are winners as long as you don't go overboard in the process."
pisces,2011-08-05,"You can touch others profoundly today, healing past hurts and mending emotional wounds. Paradoxically, it's not about doing anything intentionally now, except allowing the energy to flow through your open heart. Acting with compassion is your special gift, yet you may end up feeling like a victim if you go to extremes. You don't need to make major sacrifices to do your best work."
aries,2011-08-06,"You may be able to see through the veneer of social niceties today, revealing someone's fears that are usually kept safely hidden. You can sense an unspoken agenda, even if others act in a lighthearted manner. Your current intuitiveness might prompt you to retreat because you're not sure that you want to engage on that level. But don't withdraw too quickly; the person you thought was being negative could turn out to be your closest ally if you give him or her a chance."
taurus,2011-08-06,"You may be worried that a relationship won't meet your expectations today. Instead of overcoming your fear and scheduling a memorable encounter, you might choose to just settle back into your familiar routine. However, this laid-back approach probably isn't your best strategy and could leave you feeling disappointed with your choice. Taking the safest route now won't necessarily help you reach your destination, so open up your heart and make the first move."
gemini,2011-08-06,"Today you may be confronted with an important piece of information that you previously overlooked. You might have innocently assumed that others would support your ideas and admire your creativity. Unfortunately, strong emotional undercurrents raise concerns as you try to comprehend the complexity of the situation. Don't try to figure it all out now; the energy will shift tomorrow and you'll gain a clearer understanding of your options."
cancer,2011-08-06,"You feel pretty even-keeled now, even if a little money problem comes to the surface that requires your immediate attention. You can try to analyze the situation and logically determine your best course of action, but your solution may not come through cool reason today. The best answers will arise more easily once you stop seeking them so desperately."
leo,2011-08-06,"Your life isn't as carefree as others assume just because you make it appear as if you are having a lot of fun, even when you're troubled. Your defense mechanisms can effectively hide a very deep well of feelings today. But just going through the motions isn't very rewarding, so share some of what's on your mind with someone you trust. If you're having a hard time starting the conversation, write down your thoughts and use your notes to get the ball rolling."
virgo,2011-08-06,"Although you want to balance your desires with what others need, your good intentions could run into resistance today. It seems as if it would be easier to just gloss over your annoyance if you think that someone is keeping a secret. However your suspicion can turn into anger if you don't voice your concerns. Ironically, you may be wrong about your hunch, but you'll feel relieved once your fears are out in the open."
libra,2011-08-06,"Although you try to maintain your cool today, you know big changes are coming that could impact your closest relationships. Even if the shift seems far away, you're already feeling the pressure internally. Thankfully, you are able to find your way back to the center now if you concentrate on your core values instead of on external events. If you remain true to your highest ideals then everything else will, hopefully, fall into place."
scorpio,2011-08-06,"You don't need people to tell you what you already know, and anyone who is overly critical today may be rudely surprised at the intensity of your response. However, you don't necessarily want to be alone; it's just that you yearn for meaningful contact with your most supportive friends. Those who are seeking shallow social banter could get an earful when you share the truth as you see it. There's no need to hold back now; just be ready to deal with the consequences of your honesty."
sagittarius,2011-08-06,"You aren't interested in sharing your feelings today while the Moon visits your 12th House of Secrets. Even if others think that you're baring your soul, you have more going on internally than they realize. In fact, your philosophical ramblings can cleverly hide the real juice. Keep in mind that you might not benefit from changing your tactics. It may be wiser to take the conversation to the next level only when you're ready to be more vulnerable."
capricorn,2011-08-06,"You may be more reserved in your conversations with others today as you reconsider what you really want from your relationships. Although you aren't likely to isolate yourself completely, you're wary about getting entangled with someone who might create unnecessary drama. Trust your instincts and be ready to walk away from a situation that could complicate your life without offering you any benefits."
aquarius,2011-08-06,"You most likely have admirable intentions today, yet your plan may be thwarted through no fault of your own. Naturally, you cannot control all the variables in your surroundings, but you can take full responsibility for your response to a situation. Paradoxically, an overly positive reaction could be just as problematic as a very negative one. Avoiding emotional extremes enables you to make the best of these tricky circumstances."
pisces,2011-08-06,"Your heightened awareness today puts you in touch with emotions that may be challenging to integrate. But denying your feelings can create a whole other set of problems. You could inadvertently disconnect from the source of your inspiration if you shut down your compassion. Thankfully, you're able to move through your day gracefully as long as you remember to keep checking in with your heart."
aries,2011-08-07,"Although you're determined to be serious today, it's too soon to say whether or not you'll be successful at getting much accomplished. You are quite convincing now, and you may be as good at misleading others as you are in fooling yourself. If someone accepts your optimistic expectations as the truth, you may need to face the music when the facts are discovered. A wiser strategy is to be completely realistic now so you don't have to backtrack and revise your story later."
taurus,2011-08-07,"You could be hesitant to listen to your instincts today, even if they are telling you to take a chance. Your closest friends may be cheering you forward, yet you don't trust the positive messages you're now receiving. Keep in mind that there's no need to justify your caution to anyone. Just move at your own pace; you already know from prior experience that a slower and steadier approach pays off."
gemini,2011-08-07,"Your key planet Mercury is still tuning into ethereal Neptune, inspiring you to share your spiritual experiences, weave your words into poetic phrases and put a magical spin on nearly everything you say. Fortunately, your idealism goes a long way now toward reestablishing a solid connection with a loved one. However, an underlying tension won't likely disappear overnight. Do whatever you can to help relieve the stress, but remember that this is an ongoing work in progress."
cancer,2011-08-07,"You often keep your feelings to yourself because you're afraid of being judged or criticized. Nevertheless, today's extroverted Sagittarius Moon prompts you to blurt out what's on your mind without much consideration for the consequences. Pushing through your fears allows you to share your secrets with a trustworthy friend. Still, you're the only one who can decide how far you want to venture outside of your shell."
leo,2011-08-07,"You want to be more generous with your affections now that friendly Venus is in demonstrative Leo and the Moon is in optimistic Sagittarius. But Venus' warmth is somewhat cooled by austere Saturn, making it tougher to connect with others in a lighthearted manner. You can still come through for those you love as long as you concentrate on being real, rather than on being liked."
virgo,2011-08-07,"Your key planet Mercury is preparing to back out of your picky sign and into loud Leo. Thankfully, you'll still be able to retain your common sense because a practical Venus-Saturn alignment gives you a cool and calm perspective. You don't have to tell anyone all that you know. Although you like the idea of being open and honest, keeping some things secret can be the most appropriate thing to do. Just don't let your caution turn into apathy in the process."
libra,2011-08-07,"Surprisingly, you may be the practical one today because your ruling planet Venus connects with authoritative Saturn, enabling you to see what's real and what's an illusion. Although your easygoing charm can disarm others, your pleasant demeanor hides your inner perfectionist, workaholic or curmudgeon. If you concentrate and clearly visualize what you want, you might just find a way to make it happen."
scorpio,2011-08-07,"Once you get into your groove today, you'll be able to accomplish more than you expect. Tying up loose ends feels good and your self-confidence grows with each completed task. Remember, nothing is holding you back now except your own self-limiting fears. Stick to your agenda and continue building momentum throughout the day."
sagittarius,2011-08-07,"You are able to be very persuasive once the Moon is back in your sign. If you're passionate in your appeal, you could probably motivate people to go along with your ideas today, whether your perspective is accurate or not. Although you wouldn't mislead others intentionally, the pictures you now paint with your words can be so pretty that everyone wants to share in your vision. Although telling a tall tale might be more fun, sticking to the facts will keep you out of trouble."
capricorn,2011-08-07,"You are inclined to dramatize what you say today, and the ease with which you exaggerate makes it tough for you to be as trustworthy as usual. You can use the expansive nature of the fearless Sagittarius Moon to defend someone who may not be as eloquent as you are. Fortunately, the help you receive from reliable Saturn can keep you on the straight and narrow path. There's no hurry now; your words carry more weight when you give them time to fully sink in."
aquarius,2011-08-07,"Your friends seek out your advice today because the Moon in your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes gives you an optimistic vision of the future. Your strategy may be to focus on the acknowledgment of prosperity rather than the fear of scarcity. Fortunately, you can have a motivational impact on others now if you maintain a positive spin on what's happening, yet still remember to present both sides of an issue."
pisces,2011-08-07,"You want everyone to see how competent you are now that the Moon is back in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. However, it's challenging to balance your desire for efficiency with your need to have fun. Prioritize the tasks in front of you; if you finish the most important ones, you'll have time later to seek the pleasure you want. It will be easier for you to enjoy yourself today if you feel that you earned the right to relax."
aries,2011-08-08,"You may be the leader of the gossip squad at work today because you can waste time as long as you're having fun. But you are so quick-witted now that you might say something that shouldn't be shared. Words slip out of your mouth before you think about their impact. Keep in mind that taking a few breaths before speaking up won't make you less popular; in fact, slowing down your delivery may be enough to save you from an embarrassing situation."
taurus,2011-08-08,"You appear to be putting in maximum effort on the job, but you can simultaneously lose yourself in your daydreams, even if your double life isn't noticed by anyone else. Although others cannot tell how far from reality your mind is meandering, they can see that your rich imagination is adding something special to your practical ideas. Don't hesitate to share your creative point of view, even if it seems unrealistic to you at first."
gemini,2011-08-08,"You may be at a turning point in a friendship because you need to decide if you're going to take it to the next level or retreat to emotionally safer ground. Be careful, for you could make a bad choice today if you let your hopes color your perceptions. Postpone any major decisions for a couple of days, if you can. Once your muddled thinking clears, you'll be able to choose your course of action with more confidence."
cancer,2011-08-08,"It's challenging to compare your idealistic dreams with what you currently have in your life. The gulf between your fantasies and reality may be so great now that you don't even know where to begin. Instead of setting yourself up for failure by aiming too high, try a more modest start. Acknowledging what you've already accomplished is better than tearing yourself down with self-criticism. Beginning with a few simple affirmations can give you the positive boost you need."
leo,2011-08-08,"You may be basking in the light of admiration today, but you could fool yourself into thinking that everyone is your friend. It isn't that anyone is necessarily working against you; it's just that others have their own agendas and it's crucial for you to understand where they diverge from yours. Don't waste your breath trying to convince anyone that you're right. If you can be satisfied with what each person has to offer now, you won't set yourself up for disappointment."
virgo,2011-08-08,"You could have a tough time staying on track today because you can see fantastic possibilities everywhere you look. Although you know that hard work is key in reaching your goals, your optimism leads you to believe a task will be easier than it is. Still, you are at a fork in the road and you may not know which way to go. Just remember that you are probably missing some crucial facts, so it's wiser to take the more conservative route, even if it means walking away from the excitement for now."
libra,2011-08-08,"You're a bit of a social butterfly today, flying from one captivating conversation to another. However, this doesn't mean that you should try to avoid a more pressing subject, even if it leads to unfamiliar territory. You can still clear the air by sharing what's important to you, but circumvent a passionate discussion for a few days."
scorpio,2011-08-08,"No matter how certain you are of your current choices, it's not a good idea to trust your senses today because they can easily mislead you. Don't allow yourself to be lulled into a state of hypnotic acceptance. Even if you're dreaming of smooth sailing ahead, there are storm clouds on the horizon and you are advised to batten down the hatches while the Sun is still shining. Ironically, a rough patch might be enough of a wake-up call to get you back on course."
sagittarius,2011-08-08,The Moon's visit to your optimistic sign can raise feelings of nostalgia as you remember a kinder and gentler version of your past. But it's not smart to believe the stories you tell now because you may have changed the facts to support your current mood. There's nothing wrong with reviewing your personal history as long as you understand that you can't live fully in the present moment when you're clinging too tightly onto memories.
capricorn,2011-08-08,"You may be tempted by an unrealistic fantasy about a relationship now. However, your idealistic dreams can actually stand between you and happier days. Acknowledging your attachment to one particular outcome is a good start if you're willing to make it less important. There's no need to go to extremes and deny your preferences if you can maintain a healthy perspective."
aquarius,2011-08-08,"Perhaps you thought that you had everything under control, but today you may miss an important piece of the puzzle. Fortunately, it's not necessary to fix anything if you make a wrong assumption. Becoming more aware of your mistakes is enough for now. Don't initiate action too quickly or you could stir up a hornet's nest that leads to an intense power struggle. Your relationships are in flux, so take time to see where things are going before trying to exert too much control."
pisces,2011-08-08,"You are an avid dreamer and today's Mercury-Neptune aspect magnifies your wishful thinking. You can journey so far into the depths of your imagination that you may lose track of what's going on in the real world. An unexpected event can shock you into awareness, waking you from your contemplative state and confronting you with the truth. It may be very disconcerting at first, but the reality check could be a blessing in disguise."
aries,2011-08-09,"You may catch someone off guard with the way you exercise your self-determination today as unpredictable Uranus electrifies your ruling planet Mars. Naturally, honesty is your best policy, but your delivery style may be more important now than what you actually say. Don't state something for the shock value alone or you could lose the trust you gained by telling the truth."
taurus,2011-08-09,"Someone's erratic behavior could mess up your day and turn your schedule upside down. Fortunately, you're able to handle the situation today, but you would prefer others to stick to the original plan. Don't waste your energy worrying about what else could go wrong; instead, concentrate your attention on what you can do now to minimize any additional problems that might arise."
gemini,2011-08-09,"Your nervous energy may create a few headaches today, yet there is a simple solution: stay in touch with your own feelings no matter what happens. If you bottle up your emotions they are likely to explode, so get out and move your body instead of sitting around waiting for a meltdown to happen. It's better to express your feelings in small doses gradually, rather than precipitating a crisis by revealing everything all at once."
cancer,2011-08-09,"You may keep your thoughts and feelings to yourself today because you're embarrassed by what you want. Although you believe that your little secret is safe, you're probably more transparent than you think. Your closest friends will suspect that you're holding something back, but they know you well enough not to pry. Thankfully, your current shyness will pass if you can just get over your fears and insecurities. Your smartest strategy is sharing your inner process with a trustworthy friend."
leo,2011-08-09,"You can be so forthright today that you might shock others. Ironically, your intentions aren't likely any different than usual, but there's no reason to hide anything now. Your old defense mechanisms have been worn down and you currently don't have the strength to build up new ones. Just remember that everyone doesn't need to know every miniscule detail. Paint your picture in broad strokes for the best effect."
virgo,2011-08-09,"It's not easy to find an emotionally safe place to stand today, for you might feel as if your life is out of balance. You believe that you should remain silent and continue to do your job, yet you may be compulsively driven to even an old score. Avoid the temptation to act impulsively because you could do something that is totally out of character. Consider less radical alternatives to express your anger. You'll be able to keep your dignity intact with a more moderate response."
libra,2011-08-09,"You have entered a very social phase and you would enjoy being around more like-minded people, but you aren't interested in losing your individuality in the crowd. You might even try to do something that enables you to stand out from everyone else. However, before initiating action that you'll regret, rethink your motives. Putting yourself in the spotlight may not be as smart a move as it seems in the moment. Be your authentic self and nothing else."
scorpio,2011-08-09,"You assume that you know what others expect from you at work, and you want to please them. Unfortunately, you could take on too much now, making it difficult to decide what to do first. Still, you could lose your temper today if someone criticizes how you are doing your job. But instead of overreacting, channel your emotions into the tasks at hand. You are wiser to focus and get as much done as possible than to add to any more drama to the current situation."
sagittarius,2011-08-09,"You may think that you know how to fix a problem in a relationship, yet your solution could make matters even worse now by stirring up unnecessary anxiety. Ironically, your answer may be quite intelligent, but executing your plan falls short of your high expectations. Rushing to the rescue isn't the smartest strategy now; move slowly and give yourself enough time to consider the alternatives before committing to one path."
capricorn,2011-08-09,"You like to lean on conservative tactics when your life gets too crazy. Mechanically going through the motions is one way to buy time while things settle down. Unfortunately, reverting back to your old routine won't work now because something must change for you to feel satisfied. You may be tempted toward extreme solutions like turning everything upside down all at once. However, taking lots of tiny steps is a much better strategy than attempting one gigantic leap before you're ready."
aquarius,2011-08-09,"You want others to acknowledge your contributions at work today, but this desire for respect may bring more frustration than satisfaction. It's challenging to stay in touch with your emotions while also fulfilling your responsibilities. It feels as if you can only do one or the other, but not both. Nevertheless, the most practical approach is to keep modifying your actions as needed. Practicing flexibility now is your secret weapon."
pisces,2011-08-09,"You have more on your plate than you can handle today and too many tasks can distract you from finishing anything at all. You might have plans with family or friends that have to be changed unexpectedly due to circumstances that are beyond your control. Even if the situation seems urgent, you still have job-related responsibilities that cannot be ignored. There may not be any quick fixes available; multi-tasking the best you can is your only viable option."
aries,2011-08-10,"There may be too much happening today to process everything, especially if you're hearing conflicting stories. However, you're not very receptive because you are afraid of being misled by someone else's agenda, especially when you are on your own mission. It's tempting to defend your right to maintain your individuality, but there isn't as much at stake as you think, so pick your battles carefully before jumping into a fight."
taurus,2011-08-10,"You may feel as if you're in the middle of someone else's struggle today and you don't want to be distracted by another melodrama. You might consider avoiding the conversation completely, but you realize that you can actually have a positive impact on the situation. You don't need to come up with a solution and then sell your idea. In fact, all you have to do is listen to both sides of the argument. For now, sufficiently airing an issue could be enough to dissolve the tension."
gemini,2011-08-10,"You want to share your feelings with a trusted friend, but your harmless disclosure could inadvertently elicit an explosive reaction. You understand the necessity of exercising self-restraint today because you can sense the delicate balance of power. However, you're still not interested in changing your mind now. Unfortunately, your current lack of flexibility might make a difficult situation worse. On the other hand, trying to meet another person halfway could produce mutual benefits."
cancer,2011-08-10,"You may be feeling an upwelling of anger today, yet it seems more intense than the situation would normally warrant. Although you want to express your frustration, you don't want to deal with the emotional fallout. Play it cool and sidestep confrontation for now. Or ride your passion and say what's in your heart no matter what. There's no right or wrong answer; ultimately, it's your decision to make."
leo,2011-08-10,"You might not show your feelings today in an attempt to avoid a possible meltdown, as your emotions pull you into the shadows. You are more accustomed to the light, making it challenging for you to figure out what's currently happening. For now, don't worry about making your point. It's more important to concentrate on your emotions and to process them in real time, rather than wasting time explaining yourself to others."
virgo,2011-08-10,"You aren't happy with the role that your friends have put you in now and you're not sure how to get out of it. There are no quick and easy solutions to your dilemma, even if you are in touch with the group dynamics at play. You may be tempted to internalize another person's struggle and treat it as if it were your own. However, it's smarter to just steer clear of any melodrama that isn't yours. Don't worry about disappointing others; they'll get over it sooner than you think."
libra,2011-08-10,"Others know that you excel in the department of negotiation, so it's no surprise that they would call on you for assistance now. As much as you might want to help, you have your own decisions to make today. Nevertheless, there's still time to practice a bit of shuttle diplomacy, shuffling back and forth between the disagreeing parties. Your success depends on not getting too attached to any of the messages that you deliver."
scorpio,2011-08-10,"Your two key planets, Mars and Pluto, are pulling in opposite directions, placing you in the middle of an intense tug-of-war. You cannot just express the anger of warrior Mars because unrelenting Pluto will quickly even the score. Unfortunately, you cannot just walk away from the conflict, either. Ultimately, you must be as flexible as you can to get you through this tricky time."
sagittarius,2011-08-10,"You don't want to be drawn into an emotional squabble today yet it becomes more difficult to stay neutral, even if you try. You aren't interested in choosing sides, for this tactic will only fuel an unnecessary conflict that wastes your time. Be an outspoken community member and talk about the pitfalls of supporting fearful negativity. Follow your own brand of spirituality and let your love light shine."
capricorn,2011-08-10,"A relationship may be a major source of stress now as battle lines are drawn, making it harder to remain civil. You might prefer sorting out your differences through cool and calm communication, yet you can easily slip back into engaging in the needless drama. Instead of being forthright and expressing all your feelings today, act judiciously. A little bit of discretion goes a long way to settle everyone's frazzled nerves."
aquarius,2011-08-10,"It's not easy to maintain objectivity today, even as you try to see the pros and cons of a co-worker's plan. You think that you know what's best and you aren't afraid to tell everyone who asks. But rather than judging others, you are wiser to clean up your own act first. Making small improvements throughout the next several days is a better idea than wasting time blaming another person for your dilemma."
pisces,2011-08-10,"Your friends may think that they're helping you today, but you believe that their behavior is too controlling. However, it feels awkward to come right out and tell them to back off because that would just alienate your most supportive allies. Still, it may be time to dig in your heels by setting clear personal boundaries that enable you to feel truly independent."
aries,2011-08-11,"You may have to take a stand against a rather formidable person, but today it's you who is the tougher cookie. Unfortunately, you might not be aware that you could hurt someone's feelings because you are so determined to reach your goals. Nevertheless, you would be more effective if you didn't push so hard. Soften your approach and consider how others may react before doing something you'll regret."
taurus,2011-08-11,"Naturally, you want to follow through on your commitments, even if your schedule suddenly changes because of unforeseen circumstances. Unfortunately, other people don't seem to have the same level of integrity and you may become angry with someone who falls short of their promises. Instead of adding to the drama today, be as compassionate as possible, shift your focus to finishing your own work and don't be too judgmental of anyone else."
gemini,2011-08-11,"Your thoughts and emotions don't mix well today. You may try to manage your desires in order to fit in socially, but you could grow resentful if you don't say what you feel. Unfortunately, knowing what's best doesn't always mean that you will do the right thing. Instead of acting too quickly, think about the consequences of your actions before blindly following your impulses. You might feel differently tomorrow."
cancer,2011-08-11,"You may be upset today if someone promises one thing yet does another. However, you might withhold your feelings because you don't fully understand what's going on. It's extra challenging if you cannot trust your senses, especially if others are sending mixed messages. Accept your dilemma as a temporary situation that will soon fade, for attempts to end a conflict now will only increase your frustration."
leo,2011-08-11,"You quickly tire of a melodrama that reignites today, but this time it's different because the crisis has passed its peak and you feel strong enough to handle it. Nevertheless, you still must show up and combat the threat with a concerted effort or it could reappear again sometime soon. Respond to the current situation with compassion rather than animosity to help everything return to normal as quickly as possible."
virgo,2011-08-11,"You may be amazed by how fast you respond to a difficult situation today. Normally, you would prefer to gather facts and then take some time to think about your options before swinging into action. But there isn't enough time for such a rational approach now, so you must immediately process what is happening and use your intuition to reach a conclusion. Don't hesitate to react without your safety net of logic because any delay lessens your current chances of success."
libra,2011-08-11,"Family dynamics weigh on your mind today, possibly preventing you from doing what you want. You may be tempted to walk away from the domestic drama, but you might be under pressure to increase your involvement. Unfortunately, losing your temper is easy now, but won't help your cause. Instead, consider what can be done to settle the tension. Your innate ability to understand both sides of an issue enables you to be gracious in how you handle this tricky situation."
scorpio,2011-08-11,"You are determined to stay on track today as you push to reach your goals, even if you would rather withdraw for some precious time alone. But solitude might not be in your immediate future, even if it's high on your personal agenda. Being flexible is more important than sticking to your plan, since it's impossible to know where an interaction with a colleague might lead as emotions heat up. It's not necessary to win an argument now; it's wiser to set a course based on compromise."
sagittarius,2011-08-11,"It's frustrating if you crave something but can't afford to buy it. Maybe you want your partner or friend to rescue you now. But instead of getting angry when others don't come to your aid, try a radically different approach to find satisfaction. Letting go is your best bet today, but this tactic requires some real soul-searching to detach your happiness from the current object of your desire."
capricorn,2011-08-11,"Mars' opposition to passionate Pluto in your sign dredges up intense feelings about someone or something standing in your way. Even if you are determined to reach your goals today, you need to be careful about riding roughshod over others to get what you want. The intensity of your current ambitions may create more problems than solutions now, and scaling them back just a bit might be the most sensible thing you can do."
aquarius,2011-08-11,"You might be unusually ambivalent when asked about your plans today. Whether you're considering a new path at work or in a relationship, it's hard to make a commitment now. It isn't that you don't care; to the contrary, you care so much that you want to be absolutely certain about your choice. Even if you're feeling pressure to decide, take a few more days before letting others know."
pisces,2011-08-11,"You don't mind the idea of working today, but your ideal is far from the reality, prompting you to start planning your secret escape. But you could get into a disagreement with a friend or lover if he or she tries to coerce you into some activity that you would rather skip. Don't play the role of a martyr by agreeing to drop your plans for someone else's. Take responsibility for what you want and don't give in. Prevent problems later on by being very clear right from the start."
aries,2011-08-12,"If you haven't been able to express your annoyance, it could build into outright anger today. However, you might not have a single target for your frustration. Instead, you might feel as if you're itching for a fight. Unfortunately, you're probably just projecting your emotional discomfort onto someone else. Of course, it's better to seek the source of the negativity within. Once you locate it, you will be able to shift your attitude and be more positive in your interactions with others."
taurus,2011-08-12,"You may be obstinate today without even realizing how fixed you are in your mindset. You think that you're being objective, but your desire to hold on to your emotional security is warping your perspective. The truth is that your personal life may not be as stable as you believe. Something needs to change; embrace the unknown because you'll feel better if you allow the shift to happen without resisting it."
gemini,2011-08-12,"You may think that you have your schedule under control, but it's actually your schedule that is controlling you. Even if you try to keep up with the busy day that you've created, you might reach a point where you suddenly realize that you're spinning too many wheels without having the time to enjoy anything that you're doing. Unfortunately, there's no one to blame but yourself. Thankfully, taking charge of your life by cutting back on a few activities can change everything for the better."
cancer,2011-08-12,"It's difficult to express how you feel today because you may be afraid that once you share what you want, you won't be able to control what happens next. It's easy to become excited about the possibilities of having your needs met, but the thought of being rejected -- or even worse, ignored -- can freeze you into inaction. Don't try to reveal too much all at once; a little vulnerability now will go a long way."
leo,2011-08-12,"A unique individual could catch your attention and distract you from your previously scheduled agenda. You might not be able to maintain your perspective as you become enthralled with someone's freewheeling originality. However, you will be better off if you can acknowledge your excitement without changing your course until you fulfill your previous commitments."
virgo,2011-08-12,"You probably won't be as efficient as you wish now, especially if you decide to experiment with your approach to your regular job. You usually prefer sticking to your routine, but now boredom may prompt you to try a new method instead of doing the same old thing. However, there's a very small chance that you could invent a smarter way to do your work, but it's much more likely that your radical behavior will only add to your workload. It's better to stick to the tried and true today for optimum efficiency."
libra,2011-08-12,Impulsive behavior can lead to trouble today if you take a risk just to have more fun. It may seem that it's more important to enjoy yourself and be creative in the moment than it is to do what's expected of you now. Someone else may try to convince you that you're not making the best choice if you emphasize your needs over your responsibilities. Listen to good advice when you hear it. Don't blow off your obligations; you'll be happier in the long run if you save your playtime until your work is finished.
scorpio,2011-08-12,"You might feel just as uncomfortable today at home as you do at the office, but there isn't any other place for you to go where you feel needed. You may want to hide because it seems that you're not accepted now as a part of your family or your team at work. However, retreat really isn't necessary; simply tone down your rhetoric. Once you begin managing the intensity of your words and actions, others will once again reach out to you."
sagittarius,2011-08-12,"You have quite a bit to say today and you're eager to express it in your own bold way, even if you haven't critically thought about your current ideas. Unfortunately, your inability to keep everything in perspective now can turn a relatively simple day into a very complex one. Remind yourself of your current goals before going out on a limb unnecessarily. A few moments of reconsideration may be enough to keep you on track."
capricorn,2011-08-12,"You are usually relieved when others come out and say what they're thinking, rather than clamming up and pretending that everything is just fine. Passive-aggressive behavior makes you uncomfortable because it's harder to figure out what's really happening. Tough situations are not a problem because you can manage nearly anything today, as long as you know the deal. Nevertheless, you might have to wait a day or two until you have all the information you need to make a final decision."
aquarius,2011-08-12,"The Moon's return to your sign enables you to express your quirkiness without as much reservation as usual. Nevertheless, your friends and associates may not be as happy about your eccentric behavior as you are now. Although you might choose to block out someone else's criticism or negative judgment, it's healthier to remain open to constructive feedback. If support from others is lacking now, rest assured that it will begin to return after tomorrow's Full Moon."
pisces,2011-08-12,"You may not feel very outgoing today, but you have a lot to say anyway. Quietly meditating or taking a short escape into the magic of your own fantasies can soothe your ruffled energies. However, even if you slip away from the outer turmoil by vanishing into your dreams for a while, reality will be waiting for you when you return. Sooner or later, you'll need to face the music."
aries,2011-08-13,"You want to tell others your opinion today, even if you think that it will stir up resistance. You may not be concerned about what anyone else thinks now because you're pretty certain that your perspective is the right one. Although your plan could work just fine, your words might sound more belligerent than you actually feel. Gain the support you seek by toning down your message and acknowledging the validity of an alternate approach."
taurus,2011-08-13,"Your unwavering commitment to accomplish a task can prompt you to do things your own way at any cost, turning a positive attribute into a negative one. Your determination is admirable, but you can be so stubborn today that those closest to you wonder why you are sabotaging your own possible success. Unfortunately, your plan might be in jeopardy without the cooperation of your friends. Your blind optimism could prevent you from seeing things objectively, so be open to the advice others have to offer."
gemini,2011-08-13,"Maintaining an optimistic perspective about a current project is not easy now. You're tempted to overinflate an idea which turns it into a less useful one. Today's Aquarius Full Moon in your 9th House of Adventure inspires you to dream about the amazing possibilities ahead, rather than concentrating on the present moment. If you drift off into daydreams about the future, gently bring your thoughts back to the specific tasks at hand."
cancer,2011-08-13,"Today's Full Moon overwhelms your 8th House of Shared Resources with brilliant ideas, raising issues around jointly held possessions or investments. Someone's appeal to your egalitarian principles can provoke enough guilt so you lessen your demands. However, it's healthier for you to be an equal partner now, rather than being subservient in any way. Don't just say yes to make another person feel better, because your self-esteem may suffer if you do."
leo,2011-08-13,"Today's Full Moon illuminates your 7th House of Others, possibly reactivating an unresolved relationship issue. If you are experiencing difficulties in love, this lunation's cool logic can offer a powerful opportunity to heal. Reframing a past relationship in a new light changes your perspective and frees you to be more fully alive in every moment."
virgo,2011-08-13,"The conceptual Aquarius Full Moon falls in your 6th House of Details, tempting you to lean on your analytical skills to solve a current problem. However, you may be so logical that you cannot feel the emotional warmth coming your way now. Although you think you're listening carefully, you might not be able to pick up other people's messages unless they come in on your exact frequency. Opening your mind to new channels of communication today can teach you a very important lesson."
libra,2011-08-13,"Your creativity may be erratic today with the Full Moon brightening your 5th House of Self-Expression, yet you could put on a brilliant performance if you don't try to control the process. A smart strategy is to have a variety of things to keep you busy while you're waiting for the muse to visit. Meanwhile, stay open to riding a creative wave if it comes along, but don't be hard on yourself if nothing extraordinary happens."
scorpio,2011-08-13,"Today's Full Moon stretches you between your personal and professional goals. Although you may feel as if something could suddenly give way, your determination to restore balance to your life should override any emotional upset, even if the stress seems overwhelming at first. But denying your feelings isn't wise either, for they can lead you to an important lesson. In the meantime, focus on the present and reestablish your priorities."
sagittarius,2011-08-13,"This is a rather intense Full Moon because it opposes the dramatic Leo Sun in your 9th House of Philosophy, reactivating a familiar theme in your life. You are aware that your wanderlust makes it difficult to follow through on existing commitments. Although you might be frustrated by your current limitations, you can improve your life by simply acknowledging your adventurous desires while simultaneously managing the circumstances of your immediate environment. Be creative in everything you do."
capricorn,2011-08-13,"Your current financial condition could be rather unstable, for today's unconventional Aquarius Full Moon stresses your 2nd House of Money. Maybe you discover that your cash on hand is less than you thought or, perhaps, your bills are greater than previously calculated. Either way, don't try to avoid an issue that arises now, because handling it intelligently is much better than putting it off, even if you don't have a final solution."
aquarius,2011-08-13,"Today's Full Moon in your sign indicates that sweeping changes are necessary to get your life back on track. However, you won't need to put too much effort into solidifying your plans because unexpected events will likely require you to adapt to other people's schedules anyway. It takes courage to be flexible now instead of rigidly sticking to an old agenda that no longer works. Although this might be an exercise in cooperation, don't lose yourself in the process."
pisces,2011-08-13,"You yearn for more meaning to your life because events at work continue to require an increasing amount of your attention. Your friends and colleagues may not even notice that you're struggling as you reassess your goals, and it's probably better to leave them out of your current dilemma. But this isn't about escaping from your routine; it's about developing a more spiritual approach to everything you do."
aries,2011-08-14,"It's challenging to stay within your own limits today, especially if someone sends you mixed messages. It may seem as if a friend is flirting with you one minute and ignoring you the next. Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, but be prepared to receive a cool reality check if you need it. There may be more going on within your imagination than you realize."
taurus,2011-08-14,"You may be confused about what you're supposed to be doing today because you don't know whether to help out at home or volunteer at a community event. Either way, your highest ideals are stimulated, but you might think that you've failed before you start because it's impossible for you to live up to your expectations now. Additionally, Mercury's retrograde could enable you to rush and miss the meaning, so slow down and be gentle with yourself."
gemini,2011-08-14,"It's difficult for you to concentrate today because the Moon opposes your key planet Mercury and then slips into otherworldly Pisces. You may feel as if you're being pulled in opposite directions as you try to tell others about your cool, new idea. The more you try to narrow your focus, the further off track you go. But don't totally surrender to your fantasies, either. Your best strategy is to go with the flow for a short while before returning to your work in the real world."
cancer,2011-08-14,"Your dreams may be so big now that they don't go away when you wake up and start your day. Don't try to be overly concrete since you could be riding a creative high. Do your best to capture this magical buzz to make something beautiful. So if you must be accurate in your reporting of details, tell others that it may take you a few days before you have all your facts in order."
leo,2011-08-14,"You may not be ready to express your desires today, but your caution doesn't mean that you are uncertain. You just want more time for everything to settle down so you can decide how much to say. Until your mental clarity returns, it's best now to err on the side of sharing less. You can always tell the rest of the story later when the moment is right."
virgo,2011-08-14,"It appears that your friends and coworkers have grown wishy-washy, resisting your requests to be more specific about their feelings. It seems as if everyone stops just short of what needs to be said. You're stymied and may not even be able to respond to what's happening. Instead of making someone angry by asking more questions, wait a couple of days before searching for answers again."
libra,2011-08-14,"You may be enchanted by your dreams of fame and love, yet these wishes appear to disintegrate like a mirage when you reach out to touch them. Although your most unrealistic hopes can crumble before your eyes, don't buy into the dissolution of your fantasies. Continue to hold on to your vision of the ideal future. The current uncertainty will pass and you'll be able to regain your creative edge."
scorpio,2011-08-14,"Your soft and gentle approach might seem a bit out of character, but a deep desire to connect now flows from your newfound sense of vulnerability. Fortunately, you don't mind being seen in this state, yet self-protective fears still encourage you to maintain an emotional wall between you and others. Keep in mind that you might be misunderstood today, so remember to take extra time to explain yourself as clearly as possible."
sagittarius,2011-08-14,"You aren't expressing yourself openly these days, but this isn't about intentionally withholding information from those who should have it. Your motives are likely quite simple now, yet language can get in the way to complicate matters. Instead of trying to explain everything you want to do, just tell everyone that you need a couple of days to sort yourself out. If at all possible, don't get into it with anybody until after tomorrow."
capricorn,2011-08-14,"You won't be able to avoid the drama today as your practical outlook helps you make it through the bumpy roads of interaction, only to run into an abrupt ending of the highway. You have no choice but to continue on your path, even if there are blocks in the road. Don't worry; you won't have to turn back around. For now, just do the best you can to keep inching forward."
aquarius,2011-08-14,"You could run into an unexpected situation today that stems from your current financial condition. Even if you believe that you're in good fiscal shape, it might become apparent that you overlooked a small detail that now could become problematic. Unfortunately, no outside help will arrive to magically bail you out in the nick of time. Even if you must dig yourself out of trouble on your own, take heart because you're not alone."
pisces,2011-08-14,"The Moon's move into your sign this morning allows you to share your feelings without becoming overly emotional. You don't have to say a lot now and that's okay because your inner world is in such turmoil. Fortunately, others know what you're feeling before you even open your mouth. And when you start talking, your poetic speech can mesmerize everyone before they even know what hit them. Use your intuition wisely; don't squander your gift on meaningless chatter."
aries,2011-08-15,"You might get into an argument with an overly dramatic friend today if you believe that he or she is keeping something hidden from you. However, you could easily turn an unimportant oversight or a simple misunderstanding into a full-blown crisis because of your concern about being left out of the picture. Remember, there's no reason to expect everyone to always include you, especially if you are usually quick to be so independent."
taurus,2011-08-15,"You might be unsuccessful in your attempts to control the mysterious energies that are turning your day upside down. You're tempted to blame the instability on your friends, but their lack of follow-through isn't the real problem. You would be wise to own up to your role in manifesting the chaos you need to heighten your creative expression. Don't assume that you know how others will act; take responsibility for your part alone."
gemini,2011-08-15,"Your conversations are muddled today and to make matters worse, other people can easily misinterpret your actions. Don't judge anyone harshly if they mess up, for your behavior is probably sending ambiguous signals, even if you think that you're being straightforward. It's not worth starting a fight about something that will seem ridiculous later in the week."
cancer,2011-08-15,"Your emotions flow more freely today, allowing something to happen that catches you completely off guard. It's not that you're unaccustomed to sudden shifts in your life; it's just that you weren't expecting this one at all. Thankfully, there's nothing to be gained by going back over the past to analyze what you could have done differently. Just react from your heart in real time to handle the current situation the best you can."
leo,2011-08-15,"You may have to confront a difficult dilemma today, but the circumstances are more complicated than they seem. Your loss of perspective adds to the complexity as you try to figure out what to do. Moving away from the center of the storm helps you make more accurate observations about what's actually happening now, prior to choosing a new course of action."
virgo,2011-08-15,"Your interactions with others are overly complicated today, especially if no one seems to be playing according to the rules. Unfortunately, you might not understand everyone's behavior until you take the time to listen to what is being said. However, your discussions must move beyond any surface disagreements for them to have any value, so don't get distracted by the apparent differences of opinion."
libra,2011-08-15,"Your energy may be scattered today, making it even more difficult to finish your tasks on the job and your chores at home. You might not be too concerned that you're less productive now; nevertheless, others could be relying on you. Don't downplay the role that you have in the lives of friends and acquaintances. Remember, if you promised to do something, make sure you honor your commitment."
scorpio,2011-08-15,"There is something very strange going on today with respect to a current relationship being revitalized or a sudden attraction to a new one. Either way, it is time to remove your rose-colored glasses before something crucial happens, rather than after it. Keep in mind that it's essential to see things as they are now and not how you want them to be."
sagittarius,2011-08-15,"A family squabble might require some of your mindshare today, but others appear to be more concerned about the outcome than you are. Your lack of involvement can confuse them, especially if they think you don't care. However, you just may be uncertain about your position so far. Instead of saying nothing and letting everyone draw their own conclusions, express your concern, while still reserving your judgment until you have more facts."
capricorn,2011-08-15,"You may be very busy at home, but you might not even realize how packed your workweek is. Avoid scattering your energy; you cannot suddenly finish everything all at once. It's smarter now to counterbalance the current hectic pace with a calm and methodical approach. Don't bother trying to figure anything out; just remember that it's a gift to be simple."
aquarius,2011-08-15,"You may face resistance from friends and colleagues who believe that your current strategy is not a very good one. You don't mind a bit of healthy sparring, even if someone cajoles you into seeing things from a different perspective. But you're not as easygoing once you realize that your opponent is not giving up. You are able to heed good advice, but aren't interested in anyone making critical decisions for you or telling you what to do. Graciously accept the constructive feedback, and then follow your heart."
pisces,2011-08-15,"You cannot hide your feelings easily today because the Moon in your fishy sign brings your moods up to the surface and right out in the open. A close friend might not like what he or she sees now and could unexpectedly morph from an ally into an adversary. Fortunately, you have the strength to handle this tricky situation by acknowledging the criticism without being overly defensive, thereby defusing a possible conflict before it even happens."
aries,2011-08-16,"Although you may have the chance to be around people you really like today, you still can feel the pressure to finish your chores before you go looking for fun. Unfortunately, friends can distract you from your work because you want to join them in their activities. However, it's not wise to upset your regular routine, even if you wish to shake things up. Keep your current dissatisfaction to yourself and mind your responsibilities for now."
taurus,2011-08-16,"You may have a clear idea of what you want to do today to take care of your personal needs. You could even believe that any deviation from your plan means that you won't be happy, but this faulty thinking is far from the truth. You might be a bit emotionally disoriented now, so don't worry if the day unfolds differently than you imagined. Instead of being stuck in your comfort zone, be flexible enough to try new things."
gemini,2011-08-16,"Even if everything appears fine, you might feel unsettled today because your schedule doesn't leave much room for any relaxation. You are not required to let other people's troubles hijack your day. Keep in mind that it's entirely possible to enjoy yourself while still being emotionally responsive to those you love. Your versatility and quick wit enable you to gracefully step away from the situation."
cancer,2011-08-16,"You are ready for an easy day at the office or at home, but you probably won't be able to avoid the spotlight anyhow with the current planetary pile-up in dramatic Leo. Ironically, trying to recede into the shadows only brings more attention to you today. Thankfully, you will appreciate the love and support you receive once you stop resisting. There's nothing wrong with needing time alone to recharge your emotional batteries, but coming out from behind your shell now will do your heart good."
leo,2011-08-16,"You may have to reconsider your relationship with a close friend or business partner, especially when it comes to money. Your urgent need to iron out the details of a financial arrangement can be complicated by a lack of information or a misunderstanding of each other's assumptions. Even if you want closure today, it may be smarter to leave things open-ended for now."
virgo,2011-08-16,"The overwhelming uncertainty of your life could overtake your confidence today. But you are quite capable of covering the anxiety you are feeling now because your key planet Mercury conjuncts gracious Venus in your 12th House of Secrets. Fortunately, what you lose to unclear thinking, you gain in charm, creativity and charisma."
libra,2011-08-16,"Ask for what you want today and you just might receive it as clever Mercury conjuncts your key planet Venus, enabling you to be quite convincing. But you may have to risk a little emotional security to be heard, since your attitude is softened by sweet Venus. Be as specific as possible in your request; the more details you supply, the better your chances are of success."
scorpio,2011-08-16,You might misread someone's intentions today and turn an insignificant comment into an important event. You could even set your eyes on new objectives at work. Part of your problem is that your perspective is so distorted now that it's challenging to stay unconfused. It may be smarter to wait a day or two before you respond in order to see what happens.
sagittarius,2011-08-16,"Your anxiety stems from too many people requesting more information from you than you currently have. But you won't be able to get away with just making something up on the spot today, for your colleagues will know immediately that you are hiding something. It helps to be honest; share the plain and simple facts to the best of your knowledge and freely admit the limits of your knowledge."
capricorn,2011-08-16,"Your plans may fall apart today as the details begin to unravel. Hopefully you can see this problem as a positive experience because you are receiving an advanced warning that your ideas need more work. Don't try to force the issue and glue everything back together. Instead, rethink your strategy a day or two before taking corrective action."
aquarius,2011-08-16,"It's nearly impossible to know how to respond to someone's overdramatic presentation today. You want to help, but you're afraid that if you dig too deeply, you might uncover something that you wish you didn't know. However, if you don't investigate at all, then you won't have all the facts you need to make a big decision. Ultimately, when the answer finally comes, be ready for a surprise, for it may not be what you expect."
pisces,2011-08-16,"Although you may be very sure of a recent decision, it becomes apparent today that you would be wise to reconsider your not-as-final-as-you-thought answer. Be careful about placing your trust in your instincts now because a flash of apparent inspiration could steer you in the entirely wrong direction. But even if you see your path clearly, check your logic with a close friend or partner."
aries,2011-08-17,"It's challenging to contain yourself now that the Moon is back in your sign. You may spend so much time trying to get ahead, only to be delayed by circumstances beyond your control. Perhaps you really believe that you can talk your way out of anything, but it's hard to find your way through this tricky period. Don't whine if your boss sends you back to finish an incomplete task. Just make sure you do it right so you can fully enjoy yourself later on."
taurus,2011-08-17,"You aren't necessarily forthcoming about your intentions today because you think that your enthusiasm could attract resistance. Discretion is a smart tactic now; although you probably won't get what you want, your perseverance is very likely to be rewarded. However, you know that it's not enough to wait for the right moment. Use your current time wisely to improve upon your plan for success."
gemini,2011-08-17,"The demands on your time could be overwhelming because you're surrounded by people with big ideas. Still, you don't want to engage in lighthearted banter and playful games that distract you from your real purpose. Nevertheless, you know how to have a good time; it's just that you would enjoy yourself more if the pressure of unfulfilled obligations wasn't weighing heavily on your mind. Save the long-winded explanations for another time. Simply let others know that it's nothing personal and that you will join in the fun after your work is done."
cancer,2011-08-17,"You don't want to play the role of the bad guy just because no one else is taking responsibility for what needs to be done. The situation can be nerve-wracking, especially if others on your work team are as disorganized as they appear. But don't be overly critical; you might be correct in your perceptions, yet outright confrontation won't bring you any closer to your goals. Fortunately, your current frustration should begin to fade tomorrow when everybody seems more cooperative."
leo,2011-08-17,"It isn't enjoyable to have an adventurous streak if you cannot find a way to express it today. Unfortunately, you might experience a block in your imagination that prevents you from getting a lot done. Maybe a current event triggers an old negative thinking pattern. Or, perhaps, someone is covertly working to thwart your efforts. Instead of dealing with obstacles head-on now and fulfilling your current need for an adrenaline rush, ease off and let the tension settle on its own accord."
virgo,2011-08-17,"You don't normally mind playing with fire if you are well-trained in pyrotechnical matters. It's much easier for you to feel confident if you're the one who's in control. You know where you want to go and have a plan to get you there. However, you grow disheartened if someone stands in your way and tries to limit your freedom. Don't attempt to assume authority today, for you will only make matters worse. Your best move now is to temporarily acquiesce or to retreat. You'll be back in the driver's seat tomorrow."
libra,2011-08-17,"If you're trying to avoid a commitment, you may not be able to escape it too much longer. Unfortunately, your current options may not include what you're looking for now. You might become so discouraged that you want to throw your hands up in the air and just walk away from it all. But accepting defeat won't make you any happier. It's better to admit your dissatisfaction and continue to search for common ground. Be persistent and you will find a way through this uncomfortable dilemma."
scorpio,2011-08-17,"Three planets in steadfast Leo and your 10th House of Public Life require you to be disciplined as you work toward achieving your goals. However, you may not be satisfied with how long it will take. You want to sprint to the finish line, but it's still too far away. Do what you do best under pressure and focus on the deep satisfaction that you'll feel when you're done, rather than the frustration you experience along the way."
sagittarius,2011-08-17,"You could be flying on a creative high today, but instead you might run into blockades and delays that can bamboozle you. You aren't clear about what you're doing differently now or why you have lost your edge. Instead of worrying about being productive, consider each setback as an opportunity to catch your breath. Don't push too hard; your confidence will return soon enough."
capricorn,2011-08-17,"It's tough to express your emotions today, especially if you believe that someone has already squared off for battle. Ironically, you don't even want to win; you are more interested in people acknowledging your feelings and validating your perceptions. Avoid playing the blame game or you can inadvertently put a friend or partner on the defense. Be extra careful to take full responsibility for what's in your heart."
aquarius,2011-08-17,"You might waste time and energy following a wide variety of interests today. Although you're able to make progress, it feels as if there are stop signs facing you no matter which way you turn. But staying active is a double-edged sword because you could miss an important lesson. Slow down and pause long enough to get a clearer version of the picture. There's no need to be in such a hurry to go anywhere when there's plenty for you to do right where you are."
pisces,2011-08-17,"You may believe that spending money on something you want today increases your chances for happiness. You might be tempted to take a quick weekend getaway, but don't have the extra cash available for discretionary purchases. Don't get discouraged because good news is coming your way in the next day or two. In the meantime, concentrating your energy on a creative project that makes you feel good is better than the temporary pleasure of any escapist behavior."
aries,2011-08-18,"The Moon's current visit to your sign reflects your desire to express your feelings, even if they're not fully supported by your current relationship situation. Fortunately, saying what's on your mind won't polarize an otherwise amicable partnership; sharing your emotions will only draw you closer. Remember, your message might not be as unexpected as you think. Ultimately, it's your delivery style that will make the difference between rough waters and smooth sailing ahead."
taurus,2011-08-18,"You may think that you're being practical today, but you can take a good idea way too far before you realize what happened. Even if you agree that caution makes more sense than just charging ahead, your reactions are irrepressible now that the Moon is in impulsive Aries. Your best strategy is to observe your responses to the current circumstances, but don't share your feelings with others until you have time to process them on your own."
gemini,2011-08-18,"Your life is on an upswing now, and you're probably seeing the positive effects of your rising self-confidence. You may be more inclined than usual to talk about your feelings with your friends and associates, without giving much thought to what you're actually saying. Don't reactivate yesterday's drama; an easygoing approach that focuses on the present moment enables others to meet you on a new and more equal playing field."
cancer,2011-08-18,"You are a reluctant leader today, stepping into the spotlight because no one else can or will. Thankfully, you intuitively know what to say and when to say it, even if you don't have a solid plan at first. However, your actions might stir resistance from someone who believes that you shouldn't succeed at the expense of others. Be smart; instead of engaging in an adversarial relationship, change the rules so that everyone becomes a winner."
leo,2011-08-18,"You may be so excited about one of your ideas that you put extra effort into convincing others to sign on to your agenda today. Although the truth may be obvious to you, it's hard to understand why there are so many variations of it. If you believe that your approach is the only right way, everything you attempt will be challenged. Instead of wasting time fighting with shadows now, embrace all the different paths that can ultimately lead to your desired destination."
virgo,2011-08-18,"The intensity of your emotional interactions deepens now with the Moon in your 8th House of Intimacy pulling you into new territory. You may be eager to explore these worlds at first, but uncomfortable insecurities about your self-worth might arise once you sink into the richness of your feelings. Avoid the temptation to escape from your current vulnerability; instead, confront your issues and talk about what scares you the most."
libra,2011-08-18,"The independent Aries Moon's visit to your 7th House of Companions reflects your desire to stand separate from a relationship. You are usually quite willing to make your partner feel comfortable by putting your personal needs second. However, today it's your turn to be first. It isn't selfish to take care of yourself, for you have more energy to give to others when you are truly satisfied, too."
scorpio,2011-08-18,"You are trying to create healthy new routines for yourself with the Moon now activating your 6th House of Habits, but it's challenging to change established patterns. It's as if the weight of the past is leaning heavily on the present moment, restricting the potential of the future. Take the focus off your personal life and concentrate on the bigger picture, instead. This simple shift of your frame of reference can lighten your spirit enough to free you from an old habit or outdated outlook."
sagittarius,2011-08-18,"A positive Mars-Jupiter alignment could have everything coming up roses today. The Moon's current visit to fellow Fire sign Aries and your 5th House of Play indicates a rise in the quantity and quality of good times. You're not likely to get too lost in your thoughts, yet you can enjoy dreaming about your future now. Remain open to change and don't resist if someone shows you a different way to have fun."
capricorn,2011-08-18,"Your internal dilemma now is about living with your newfound need to be spontaneous, while also honoring your natural tendency to be cool and calculating. You are highly motivated to push the edges of the envelope today, yet your desire to do things right also serves to gain you recognition from your peers. Don't be too quick to swing into action on this paradoxical day."
aquarius,2011-08-18,"There's a lot going on in your life now, and you might not want to partake in an event that you previously agreed to a while back. Unfortunately, there may not be a simple way to back out of your commitment now, even if your priorities have changed. Instead of trying to fit into someone else's routine, politely decline and do what makes you feel good, instead. Fortunately, you should be able to get away with switching your plans without offending anyone else."
pisces,2011-08-18,"Rather than walking away from a creative project or lazily doing nothing, make it your goal today to improve upon something that you have already started. The Moon's visit into your 2nd House of Finances may reveal a bit of fiscal instability, but immediate action can prevent the situation from spinning out of control. Just remember that reviewing your options doesn't mean that you also need to reinvent the wheel now to make progress."
aries,2011-08-19,"You may be concerned that yesterday's excitement has passed, but now it's time to settle your energy to sustain the progress you already started. However, you need to be careful, for you can get so caught up in what you want that you forget about respecting sensible limits. If you start to obsess about a person or a thing, take it as a sign that it's time to stop pushing so hard."
taurus,2011-08-19,"The Moon returns to your sign this morning, enabling you to simplify your life. However, you may feel so lazy that you let the day slip by without getting much accomplished. Fortunately, your senses are sharp and your conclusions are logical, but you still could make a mistake by giving an idea or a person the benefit of the doubt. Everything is not always perfect; processing negative feelings may require courage, but can also lead to deeper intimacy."
gemini,2011-08-19,"Your clever words make it seem as if you are completely engaged in an interaction, but your witty repartee is likely hiding your emotions. Although you may believe that limited disclosure is a wise strategy today, whatever you don't say can have just as much impact as what is discussed. Instead of laughing off an intense feeling, try to express what is truly in your heart."
cancer,2011-08-19,"You may receive sufficient support from your friends and co-workers today, but there could be unspoken demands that come along with their help. There are emotional undertones to everything that happens now and you might be expected to return a favor even if you never were told that was part of the deal. But don't let your annoyance turn into resentment; be upfront and express yourself clearly from the start."
leo,2011-08-19,"You might struggle today as you try to rein in your emotions so you don't get distracted through the first part of the day. Your heart may be on fire with romantic urges when the Moon harmonizes with sensual Venus in your sign, but it seems that expressing your desires isn't in the cards right now. Instead of assuming that you'll get what you want later, it's much healthier to simply accept the current situation for what it is without clinging to any additional expectations."
virgo,2011-08-19,"You don't want to get overly involved in a friend's melodrama today, but you may be drawn into it anyhow. Fortunately, your ability to be a good listener is augmented by maintaining your cool objectivity. Your practical approach is probably exactly what is required to smooth someone else's ruffled feathers. Your own needs might have to take a back seat while you help out someone you love."
libra,2011-08-19,"Your friends set a lovely example by showing their affection and respect for you. However, upon closer scrutiny, everything isn't as it seems. Feelings that haven't been shared might be lurking just beneath the surface today, adding a sense of apprehension to your interactions with others. Don't let a little miscommunication become a big deal. Requesting immediate clarification helps prevent you from reading more into a situation than is actually there."
scorpio,2011-08-19,"The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships can prompt you to reveal more than you intend as she charms her way into a flowing trine with secretive Pluto in your 3rd House of Communication. You might think that sharing your current worries with a trusted friend will assuage your fears. However, nearly anything you say now can turn your best of intentions into an emotionally intense conversation. You may regret expressing your feelings at first, but the outcome will likely be extremely worthwhile."
sagittarius,2011-08-19,"Although you may truly believe that any difficulty can be handled if you have the right attitude, your theory will likely be tested today. Fortunately, a volatile emotional conflict won't create any long-term problems, but it could wreak havoc on your stress levels for a while. Maintain a healthy perspective on your feelings by continuing with your regular daily schedule. Your rattled nerves should be calmer tomorrow."
capricorn,2011-08-19,"It isn't your preference to stop what you're currently doing to dig into an emotional issue that doesn't seem to have an immediate impact on your day. Nevertheless, your subconscious mind might be sending you signals that warp your perceptions today just enough to throw a conversation off course. It's smarter to get to the source of the problem before it becomes even more complicated by your denial."
aquarius,2011-08-19,"An attractive friend or lover may be sweet toward you today, tempting you to lower your guard. Normally, you would happily comply, but he or she might have a hidden agenda now, making this a tricky transition. Don't isolate yourself from those you like. Continue listening but also pay attention to what isn't being said, because the hidden information holds more sway over your day than what's actually shared."
pisces,2011-08-19,"Your methodical approach to your work today can make the difference between a low production day and one that's off the charts. You may feel as if other people are trying to bring you down or impede your progress on the job. But even if this is true now, you may not be able to address the problem directly. Instead, keep shining your light by taking the high road. The external resistance will eventually fade if you can avoid empowering it with your negativity."
aries,2011-08-20,"A bit of sensible self-restraint is wise because you tend to see more of the good news than the bad today. The power of positive thinking may be on your side; however, you can take this strategy too far by ignoring the facts. Remember, it's helpful to be an optimist, but it's not useful to remain in denial."
taurus,2011-08-20,"You won't likely veer too far off course today, even if a different route looks better than the one you're already traveling. Fortunately, you can recognize that there are many ways to reach the same goal and the one that works for someone else isn't necessarily the best choice for you. Be appreciative and acknowledge each of the ideas that are presented to you now before returning to your path, knowing that it will serve your purpose best."
gemini,2011-08-20,"Although you are feeling pretty good today, you may believe that it's important to keep your optimism under wraps. The Moon's conjunction with jolly Jupiter in your 12th House of Secrets means that no one will know that you're smiling on the inside. In the meantime, don't forget about your obligations. Having fun isn't just an excuse to get out of work. In fact, you should be able to find a way to combine your responsibilities with a lighthearted attitude that enables you to be productive while still enjoying yourself. Just be careful not to take on more than you can do."
cancer,2011-08-20,"Your friends can be a source of joy today as the Moon joins jovial Jupiter in your social 11th House of Community. Nevertheless, you could still have a tough time expressing a secret fear if you are concerned that others may not accept you just the way you are. You might even grow frustrated with your own inhibitions, wishing that you were more easygoing. Don't waste energy trying to do anything that's uncomfortable now; just observe your feelings and say what's on your mind only when you are ready."
leo,2011-08-20,"It's an absolute relief to let someone else take the lead today. Giving up control can be very exhilarating on its own, but you're in luck now because your friends or co-workers may have something fun in mind. Processing your own resistance quickly allows you to open up some playtime in your already busy schedule. Go ahead and indulge yourself; your work will still be there when you return."
virgo,2011-08-20,"You may want to retreat into a more private space because excessive social activity makes you feel nervous today. Unfortunately, you have to incur interactions with others to do your job or to accomplish what is expected of you. If you withdraw, the pressure could build until you fulfill your commitments. Paradoxically, you might have a great time once you stop resisting the inevitable."
libra,2011-08-20,"Today could be a wonderful day if you are open to all the potential possibilities that come your way. But as the day unfolds, it appears that you are more attached to an old agenda than you previously thought. Someone may seem quite stubborn and can become a pain in your neck until you realize that you're being inflexible, too. Adapt to the changing circumstances and enjoy yourself while you can."
scorpio,2011-08-20,"Something that bothered you recently seems less annoying now. Perhaps you change your attitude when you learn additional information that you were previously missing. Or, maybe you simply have a change of heart. You may see the very same person who was obstinate yesterday as the source of steadfast support today. In any case, your willingness to try new experiences can attract exactly what you are seeking."
sagittarius,2011-08-20,"You cannot escape from the drudgery of routines now, but someone can take you on a little adventure that leaves you relaxed and reinvigorated. Whether it is a fascinating discussion at a long lunch with friends or a peaceful sunset stroll with your sweetie, getting away for a bit today is exactly what you need to clear your mind."
capricorn,2011-08-20,"You're eager to start on your new project, even if you don't know where it will take you yet. Your willingness to make a commitment before you have all the details stems from your high level of self-confidence. You are secure in knowing what you stand for now and what you bring to the situation, freeing you to say yes to an intriguing opportunity and save the hard questions for later."
aquarius,2011-08-20,"The potential for fun and games continues to grow, making it nearly impossible for you to choose only one path. But you need to limit your activities because you cannot do everything. Still, you may take on more than you can handle today, without realizing that too much of a good thing can tire you out or, at the least, cause indigestion. Practice moderation; a bit of self-restraint now allows you to have a better time in the long run."
pisces,2011-08-20,"Your emotional satisfaction may not be noticeable by most of those around you today. Oddly enough, you can be very happy without your friends or co-workers having any knowledge of your personal world. Meanwhile, a partner or family member comes to the rescue by being able to see a different side of the story. Letting your joy overflow opens other avenues of communication which are easily expressed within a more private and personal venue."
aries,2011-08-21,"The closer you get to the facts today, the more you realize that you don't really know what's happening. Although you may be inclined to jump to premature conclusions now, the longer you can sit with your uncertainty, the better your chance for success. Instead of pushing for resolution on a relationship issue, allow yourself to let go of your need for control and be enchanted by the mysteries of love."
taurus,2011-08-21,"Your key planet Venus opposes imaginative Neptune today, tempting you to confuse reality with your dreams. However, you probably won't float off into the clouds with the Moon in your pragmatic sign for most of the day. Pay attention to your heart's desires now, because you could turn a daydream into something real. Be willing to take a risk and let go of what you assume to be true."
gemini,2011-08-21,"You have a great idea about what you want to do today, but your preferences are limited by practical considerations that prevent you from getting exactly what you want. Instead of feeling disappointed if reality falls short of your expectations, look for the undiscovered opportunities that come along with the unexpected changes. There are more options than you can imagine if you only remain open to them."
cancer,2011-08-21,"You could easily miss some important details today because your daydreams are so distracting. One strategy includes asking lots of questions and remembering to read every word before signing anything. Mercury's current retrograde requires you to reconsider your financial options, but your mind is operating with fuzzy logic now. Don't assume that everything will just work out for the best. You may be sorely disappointed if you do."
leo,2011-08-21,Relationships can present a real dilemma today because sweet Venus in your sign adds to your charm while nebulous Neptune clouds your judgment. Someone may enchant you now as your imagination turns a frog into a prince (or princess) in your mind. Everything looks good until you wake up and have to deal with things the way they are in reality rather than how they are in your fantasies.
virgo,2011-08-21,"You may be in for a frustrating day if you think that you need to maintain control in a relationship. But your illusions will likely dissipate quickly, like clouds after a storm, once you have your first confrontation with a friend or partner who doesn't buy into your way of seeing things. Letting someone else lead for a while lessens the pressure and allows you to enjoy yourself without having to know every detail."
libra,2011-08-21,"Your ruling planet Venus brings you a beautiful image today, but it's slightly out of focus as she engages in a tug-of-war with mystical Neptune. It may be difficult to meet your responsibilities now because you prefer seeking the elusive perfection of beauty than dealing with mundane reality. But don't leave your chores undone; once your work is finished you can drift off into dreamland without any interruptions."
scorpio,2011-08-21,"A solution to a dilemma may not be forthcoming today, but part of the problem is that you won't receive useful answers until you can formulate clear questions. Take some quiet time away from your current responsibilities to untangle your thoughts. Once you've established a logical starting point, the rest of the process will be much easier. Nevertheless, be patient; it may take a few days to obtain the clarity you need."
sagittarius,2011-08-21,"Even if you're dealing with the same issues as yesterday, they might not appear to bother you as much today. However, just beneath your life-is-beautiful veneer, stresses are still at work. Don't waste energy trying to make your life look better than it actually is. Once others see that you have problems like everyone else, they'll be more inclined to interact with you personally. Expressing the truth reveals your vulnerability and opens a door for a truly honest relationship."
capricorn,2011-08-21,"You may not know what to think today as your core beliefs are brought into question. Thankfully, you no longer have to pretend that you have all the answers. Once you're free from being in charge, you'll have more time to delve into your own subconscious to discover where things may have gone awry. Practice being more flexible; if you are too rigid in your thinking now, something may have to give and it won't likely be very pleasant."
aquarius,2011-08-21,"You might be having a problem within an intimate or family relationship today, yet you cannot see things as they truly are. Your imagination has overtaken reality and you aren't able to get to the bottom of an issue because your judgment isn't as sharp as usual. Don't push too hard for any sort of change now; just let the process happen at its own rate."
pisces,2011-08-21,"It's not easy for you to keep your impulses in check today, especially if someone is tempting you to go out on a limb and express your feelings. But your partner or a friend could lay down some rules now that won't let you off the hook so easily. Instead of striking out because you're afraid of being vulnerable, integrate your fears into your life and face them before you experience a relationship crisis."
aries,2011-08-22,"It's not easy to follow through on whatever you start today. You probably have already promised more than you can deliver, and noisy distractions make it even harder now to concentrate on any particular task. Fortunately, you can turn a difficult situation to your advantage when necessary, so focus your intentions on the present moment and make some magic happen."
taurus,2011-08-22,"Although you are able to accomplish a lot today, it's challenging to keep up with so many things pulling you in a variety of directions. You could quickly exhaust yourself if you don't set sensible limits early in the day. You truly want to please others now, making it hard to say no to their enticing offers. Ultimately, you can gain more respect for stating what you can't do than falling short of your unrealistic promises."
gemini,2011-08-22,"The Moon's return to inquisitive Gemini has you asking one question after another about what you're doing and where you're going. It's wise to take time to be alone now so you can think about your goals, even if it's tempting to distract yourself with social activities. Don't let your desire for fun keep you from following through with what you know is best."
cancer,2011-08-22,"Your ability to play it low key enables you to show up at work without revealing too much about your personal life. Others may think that they can see the true you, but you might be turning on the charm in order to hide something you don't want to talk about. Trust your intuition now; don't divulge your feelings until you're more comfortable with what you have to say."
leo,2011-08-22,"You are in the midst of an internal battle, although it may play out now in the realm of relationships. The radiant Sun in your generous sign encourages you to express the love that's in your heart while its opposition to spiritual Neptune dissipates the boundaries that would normally prevent you from going further. Unfortunately, your friends won't be of much help now because they'll just tell you to throw caution to the wind. Being brave is admirable, but you could regret your actions if you act foolishly."
virgo,2011-08-22,"It's tough to make a job-related decision today, for you wish you could travel down both paths that diverge at a fork in the road. Even if you can delay your final judgment for a few days, you may not be able to avoid making a choice about your future. Take your time and consider all of the alternatives before agreeing to any long-term commitments."
libra,2011-08-22,"You might want everyone to know that you're up for anything the group decides today. You may even believe that it's more important now to support your friends and co-workers than it is to further your own agenda. But you want to enjoy yourself as much as anyone else, so don't be so fast to minimize your desires for the sake of the community."
scorpio,2011-08-22,"You are motivated to shine professionally now with the Sun in your 10th House of Status. You are often content to work behind the scenes, yet today you yearn to be on center stage. You are doing a great job and want everyone to know about your superhuman efforts. You may feel as if a new set of priorities is replacing the old list of rules. Don't question your objectives; just push toward them and see how it feels. You can always return to your previous agenda if you so choose."
sagittarius,2011-08-22,"Your goals may become increasingly significant now that someone rattles your nerves when he or she doesn't support your program. It's hard for you to understand why others aren't more concerned about the future, and it makes you feel slightly out of control. Instead of attempting to tighten the reins, it's smarter to loosen them for a while and see where it all goes."
capricorn,2011-08-22,"You can feel the Moon's restless tug as she pulls you one way and then another. You might attempt to disregard your shifting emotions, but you don't seem to have a lot of control now over your feelings. Let the whimsical winds carry you along because attempts to alter their direction are fruitless. Take scenic routes and detours whenever possible today, for your horizons widen as soon as you step off the beaten path."
aquarius,2011-08-22,"You may be struggling to find your way in a relationship now, even if everything seems copasetic to others. You're hopeful that the current tension will dissipate all by itself before emotions erupt. But unspoken issues lurk beneath the surface, like monsters in a nightmare waiting for you to let down your guard. The Moon is in your 5th House of Romance, so keep shining the light of your awareness to bring up your fears where they can finally be put in their proper perspective."
pisces,2011-08-22,"Your key planet Jupiter opens doors faster than you're able to walk through them today. Oddly enough, if you do grab on to an opportunity, you still may have to wait a while until it begins to pay off. It might feel as if you have been here before; somehow, it seems like the wheels of time are turning backward. Nevertheless, keep looking ahead; it's the future that's calling and not the past."
aries,2011-08-23,"Apologizing doesn't come easy to you, yet it's critical to find a way to overcome your resistance to being wrong. It's healthy now to admit that you still may have a bit of growing to do. However, it's not enough to just say the proper words and think that you're off the hook. You have to feel it from the heart -- and getting in touch with your emotions requires you to slow down and listen to what's going on beneath the ongoing noise of your life."
taurus,2011-08-23,"You want to concentrate on the good news today rather than focusing on your feelings of insecurity or vulnerability. You are able to project an upbeat attitude and confident self-image now, even if you're silently concerned about something you aren't sharing. Your worries may be valid, but you'll only make matters worse if you believe that you can handle your problems without involving someone you love."
gemini,2011-08-23,"You might talk up a storm today, but being chatty is a useful way to cover up your emotional insecurity. You may not have as much self-confidence as others think, but you can rest assured that your feelings will settle down, even if your return to normalcy takes a few more days. If your moods are unstable now, saying less should enable you to be more truthful about anything that's really important to you."
cancer,2011-08-23,"You may be stirring up your own trouble today by imagining that people aren't telling you the whole story. Your fears can be magnified if others have little or nothing to say, but it could be your own emotional reserve that encourages them to act similarly. Rather than asking lots of questions to show your interest, take a risk and share a bit about your own personal history first. Your openness might be exactly what is necessary to get the conversation flowing."
leo,2011-08-23,"One of the ways you can acknowledge the Sun passing out of your sign and into service-centered Virgo is to let go of any self-centered feelings. Naturally, it's important to have enough confidence to successfully begin a new project. But too much focus on yourself isn't the healthiest thing right now. Disperse some of the imbalance by shifting your attention to your friends and associates. Ultimately, it's more efficient and fun to work as equals, even if you are technically running the show."
virgo,2011-08-23,"Someone may try to convince you that you're doing the right thing, but you're not so sure about it. Part of your predicament is that you can waver on nearly any decision today, possibly creating chaos in your schedule. Don't let your self-judgment run the show; instead, seek to understand how everyone else sees you now. Envisioning yourself as part of the big picture can help to reduce any temporary feelings of isolation."
libra,2011-08-23,"You may be under the illusion that whatever you create now is artistically sound, even if it's not of practical value. Nevertheless, it's silly to waste energy trying to justify what you've done based on what you believe someone will say after you're finished. Even if you receive harsh criticism later, you can still learn from your current experience. The best way to discover what you can do is to simply do it."
scorpio,2011-08-23,"You're usually not interested in messing around with shallow conversations or activities that sidetrack you from more meaningful interactions. Today is no exception with the Moon's visit to your 8th House of Deep Sharing encouraging you to experience the full intensity of life. Ironically, you might not want to get your hands dirty in the process now that the Sun is in fussy Virgo. Keep in mind that exerting emotional control to tidy up an uncomfortable situation could ultimately turn it into exactly what you're attempting to avoid."
sagittarius,2011-08-23,"Although you may be rather even-tempered today, a friend or partner can get under your skin, eventually provoking you to snap. Be smart and don't try to hide your annoyance because it's more disruptive if you bury it. Your feelings won't take avoidance or denial as a viable strategy now. Express your frustration calmly; everyone will feel better once the air has been cleared."
capricorn,2011-08-23,"You don't want to let your feelings stand in the way of your ambitions, but your fantasies can lead you down a dead-end strategy today if you don't pay attention to the facts. Thankfully, you can negate your unrealistic expectations by asking questions and then listening carefully to the feedback you receive. Integrating critical information now can increase your efficiency at work while helping you to be more realistic in the long run."
aquarius,2011-08-23,"Others tend to see you as less practical than you really are now. Although you yearn for the ideal rather than the reality because you want everything to be beautiful, there are limits to your daydreams. An imaginative view of the world based on obsessive thinking isn't necessarily helpful, so don't get so wrapped up in your own thoughts that you miss what's right in front of your nose. Deal with the truth today rather than waiting until after the damage is done."
pisces,2011-08-23,"You are eager to handle a difficult situation by swinging into action right away, even if you don't have a practical plan in mind yet. Although you may not be the impulsive type, your idealism can inspire you to react today without thinking about the consequences. Nevertheless, you are wise to reevaluate your options prior to committing to any one path. Postpone the most critical decisions until you have had sufficient time to consider where your current strategy will take you."
aries,2011-08-24,"You may be so aware of your shortcomings today that your self-doubt negatively impacts your ability to have fun. In fact, you might not even be interested in joining the party now. Don't waste time worrying about anyone else's judgments. Just be as clear as possible about your boundaries when you tell your friends that you would rather stay home and have some quiet time by yourself. Nurturing yourself first will enable you to be more considerate of others later."
taurus,2011-08-24,"You have something important to do at work today, but you don't necessarily want everyone to know about it. Unfortunately, it's difficult to make enough time because you're probably busier than you prefer, and you won't be able to change your schedule until you meet your obligations. Others are expecting a lot from you, so do the best you can to deliver what you promised."
gemini,2011-08-24,"You wish that your emotions would settle down, but it's too soon to breathe a sigh of relief because there's still a bit of rough water for you to swim through. You need to make sure that you put your priorities straight now and communicate your needs to those around you. You might not receive the support you want right away, but your gentle persistence should pay off by the weekend after Mercury turns direct. Have patience; there are better days ahead."
cancer,2011-08-24,"You sea-dwelling Crabs are exceptionally sensitive to the lunar cycles, and you have a lot on your mind now as the Moon visits your self-protective sign. You might feel overly vulnerable today because it appears that others know something about you that you thought was a secret. Nevertheless, you can't just hide inside your shell once you've already been seen. Thankfully, those who love you won't be deterred by your resistance."
leo,2011-08-24,"You could have a bit of repair work to do in a personal relationship, but unfortunately, knowing what went wrong is not the same thing as being able to fix it. Thankfully, your good intentions can go a long way today. Don't be hard on yourself if you can't meet someone else's expectations. You aren't responsible for how others feel; just stay focused on love, without needing to know where it will take you."
virgo,2011-08-24,"You may be spending a lot of time rethinking your goals and trying to figure out a way to create the life of your dreams. Although you're growing tired of mentally living in the future, nostalgia isn't healthy now either. Stop worrying about yesterday and tomorrow; methodically keep bringing your focus back to the here-and-now. You'll be happier once you commit to staying in the present moment."
libra,2011-08-24,"You want to maintain your objectivity today while other people attempt to tug on your heartstrings and activate your emotional attachments. Rationally, you know it's wise to avoid intimate interactions now that could reveal your vulnerability. However, your feelings are not ruled by your logic, so you might as well just give yourself permission to be human and experience the pleasure and pain of irrational passion."
scorpio,2011-08-24,"You can see far into the distance now that the Moon is visiting your 9th House of Faraway Places. Your view of the future is vastly different from what you expected because everything is so much clearer now. But this can be tricky, for it's not about anything that's out there. Your inner world is currently more accessible to you, allowing you an additional level of clarity. Just remember that you're the creator of your fantasies, and it's still up to you to make them come true."
sagittarius,2011-08-24,"You aren't as comfortable today as the Moon wades through your emotionally complex 8th house. You might choose to engage in a competitive sport, participate in exciting outdoor activities or simply head out on an adventure to parts unknown. Nevertheless, you have a much different kind of exciting drama waiting for you when you explore the feelings you want to share with someone special. Don't let your fears prevent you from discovering the treasures of love."
capricorn,2011-08-24,"A good friend might need your assistance today -- or, at least, that is how it appears. But you aren't one to go rescuing an underdog unless you can clearly rationalize what you are doing. However, you are far from being cold-hearted; it's just that your practicality can now stand in the way of a kinder and gentler type of love, if you let it. Sometimes there are intangible rewards for helping others that are well worth your altruistic efforts."
aquarius,2011-08-24,It's hard to feel at ease today because it seems as if someone is blocking your efforts. Your reaction has nothing to do with paranoia; it's just that you prefer avoiding unnecessary disappointment and pain that might follow you around if you lower your protective walls. Don't do anything that could possibly add to your stress. Just pay close attention to where your heart leads you now.
pisces,2011-08-24,"You would be wise to temporarily set aside your responsibilities for a bit today, even if they continue to pile up in your absence. Your psychic powers are quite strong now, enabling you to know what others want, even if nothing is spoken out loud. Put your extraordinary abilities to work by helping someone who can benefit from your compassionate assistance."
aries,2011-08-25,"You intuitively believe that it's a good idea to follow your feelings today, even if you don't know where they are taking you. You may be uncomfortable with the idea of giving up some of your freedom, yet this seems to be a small price to pay for establishing a magical connection with a powerful person. Remember that narrowing your options to get something in return can actually feel good in the long run."
taurus,2011-08-25,"Being emotionally fulfilled isn't only about feeling good today; it's also about being aligned with a higher purpose. Luckily, it's easier to accomplish your goals now that your head and your heart are in tune with each other. You know what to do to attract wealth and to express love, so don't let self-doubt limit your options. Dream as big as you can and be ready to grab the brass ring when you get the chance."
gemini,2011-08-25,"It's difficult for you to slow down enough to sink into your emotions, especially if you're afraid of what you might discover. Once you let the distractions fade away, you could be pulled into the dark recesses of your imagination where a clever turn of phrase isn't sufficient to bring you back into the light. If, however, you have the courage to be patient, negativity will dissipate and you will return with treasures from your journey within."
cancer,2011-08-25,You are relieved that you get to handle the intensity of someone else's fears today because you have already wrestled with your own inner demons. It's not that you have all the answers; it's just that you are now willing to witness the process for others without feeling threatened yourself. Don't underestimate the commitment that is required; this is intense emotional work and your compassion will be greatly appreciated.
leo,2011-08-25,"It's not easy to find an uplifting story in the midst of the gloom today, but your persistent search can uncover important realizations that change your day for the better. You are learning about maintaining your own emotional health now, yet your lesson may be an unexpected one. You haven't chosen an easy journey, but investigating beneath the surface can change your perspective and give you a whole new point of view."
virgo,2011-08-25,"Your emotions are a source of power now and even the most challenging obstacle in your path won't slow you down very much today. Of course, you want to concentrate your efforts on whatever issues arise, but at least you'll do so with a positive and practical attitude. Luckily, this isn't about being in denial; in fact, it's your critical thinking that enables you to see through the camouflage and effectively cut to the chase."
libra,2011-08-25,"As hard as you try to avoid it, you are still pulled into a complex emotional drama today that raises an old familiar issue. Fortunately, there's nothing threatening in the present circumstances, yet they still remind you of a previous power struggle when you weren't as much in control of your feelings. Don't look back, or your fears can prompt you to limit your current options. Instead, consider the possibilities; anything you put your mind to now has the potential of becoming real."
scorpio,2011-08-25,"Your power comes from your magical ability to undergo a surprising metamorphosis today. You are like the legendary phoenix that arises from the ashes as Pluto harmonizes with magnetic Venus. Others might be afraid of such dynamic change, but you instinctively know that it's futile to resist these evolutionary waves. Being flexible enough to go with the emotional flow now is a sign of strength, not weakness."
sagittarius,2011-08-25,"Although you can disagree about the truth of a story, it's pointless today to do battle over a simple difference of opinion. However, explaining your beliefs enables you to separate them from the hard facts. Making this distinction is quite helpful now, and lessens your chance of getting into an argument over a topic where there can never be a clear winner."
capricorn,2011-08-25,"You won't likely be sweet-talked into capitulation today, yet you could perform some gentle persuasion yourself. You might try sheer stubbornness as a strategy now, but it's only because you feel like you have too much to lose. Don't waste energy trying to protect yourself; instead go out and do something creative in order to mix up the energy. Others will appreciate you making the first move."
aquarius,2011-08-25,"Anything you choose to keep to yourself now will carry even more weight than what you reveal. But this is not a permission slip to tell everything to everybody; there are many things that are best left unsaid. Just think through your motives for sharing and then select the best time to talk. If you have a purpose for expressing what's in your heart, then your current communication will ideally bring an important feeling out into the open."
pisces,2011-08-25,"The sharpness of your practical analysis prompts you to make an important decision about your feelings today. But ironically, you might feel like you're temporarily lost in the desert in search of an oasis. Although you exhibit strength of purpose in your current choices, a lack of commitment could be problematic. Deciding with your head is not as long-lasting as following your heart."
aries,2011-08-26,"You might feel like everything is ready to change, but the energy isn't quite clicking the way you wish it would today. It's almost like you've hit a really big nail, but not quite on the head, so you're thinking about doing it again, but this time with more accuracy. Don't worry if the productive groove is elusive; just keep going through the motions. You're very close. The next try may be the one that succeeds."
taurus,2011-08-26,"If you feel like you're stuck between tending to your immediate personal needs and keeping your life on track to reach your long-term goals, be patient. Instead of trying to resolve the tension now, take a bit of time to sneak off somewhere by yourself so you can think about your options before initiating action. There's no need to get lost in endless discussions with friends because everything has already been said. The choices you make today must come from within."
gemini,2011-08-26,"You aren't ready to settle down yet since you still have a few things to finish up. However, it could feel as if you're being observed today and so you need to perform under pressure. It's not easy to set an even pace and stick to it. Even if you can think quickly on your feet, it's tough now to turn your thoughts into action. Give yourself time; the momentum will build after Mercury starts moving forward."
cancer,2011-08-26,"Overcoming self-doubt can take a lot of work, but your brilliance could easily outshine any lingering negativity today. You can get into trouble, though, if you lose sight of the impact you have on others. Talking yourself out of your insecurity is one thing, but you might come on so strong that you inadvertently overstep someone's boundaries. A middle-of-the-road approach should work best for you now."
leo,2011-08-26,"You don't mean to be offensive to anyone, but you could be so insistent now that you become a real pain in someone's neck. Thankfully, a little self-awareness could be enough to do the trick. Watch the tone of your words and allow room for others to share their opinions, too. Even if you believe that you are right, acknowledging that there may be a variety of perspectives will make you easier to approach."
virgo,2011-08-26,"You may be touched by magic today, yet it's disconcerting if you don't understand exactly what's going on. Trying to talk to a trusted friend about your spirituality or a psychological issue might be fruitless, for words won't fully describe the elusive realities of your dreams. Setting aside language is challenging, but keep in mind that you can come back to discuss your current experience in a day or two. In the meantime, work with your intuition instead."
libra,2011-08-26,"You need to let your friends know how you feel today, but you may be so wound up that you cannot stop once you start telling your story. You want to be understood and acknowledged, which can make you seem more desperate than you actually are now. Others may be confused by your uncharacteristic directness, so it's a smart idea to monitor yourself and be gentle with your delivery."
scorpio,2011-08-26,"You are in the spotlight now that the Moon is in your 10th House of Public Life, magnifying the consequences of your actions. You long for more privacy, but there's no simple way to escape the notice of your friends and associates. Be careful about how you deal with your discomfort because saying something out of character might convey your annoyance, but it won't solve anything. You would be smarter to wait a day or two until the current attention begins to wane."
sagittarius,2011-08-26,"Instead of spending your time analyzing your current position and planning your future, it's time to get out and do the exciting things you have been dreaming about. However, don't try to do everything all at once or you'll just exhaust yourself before you get very far. At work and at play, being lazy is not an option today, so find a healthy balance between doing very little and too much."
capricorn,2011-08-26,"You may become uncomfortably aware of strong desires that won't go away now that the Moon is in your 8th House of Intimacy. Listen up, for you are receiving messages from the recesses of your subconscious. Anything that you try to deny will return again with more power. It's wise to proactively engage your fears, attractions and desires before they get the best of you."
aquarius,2011-08-26,"You want to be around other people today because engaging in casual dialogue allows you to see yourself more clearly. The Moon is visiting your 7th House of Relationships, so this isn't a time to set out on your own. Nevertheless, you need to be careful, for everyone else has an agenda, too. Don't even bother trying to explain your goals now; there's already too much on your plate. Go ahead and socialize, but don't get lost in anyone else's dreams until you begin to realize your own."
pisces,2011-08-26,"You may not feel as if you're at the top of your game now with the Moon's presence in your 6th House of Health and Work. You cannot be too concerned about fame or fortune today because you must take one step at a time and handle each task that's right in front of you. Fortunately, if you take it slowly you can still express your individuality without upsetting things. It's fine to dance to a different drummer as long as you don't forget to meet your obligations."
aries,2011-08-27,"You need to watch what you say today, instead of just speaking impulsively. You could react to someone so quickly that you may say something you later wish you had kept to yourself. Save your sarcastic repartee for another day when the tensions aren't so tightly wired. Your unconscious rapid-fire response has the potential of turning into a lit match in a pile of dried hay. Take a deep breath and count to ten before opening your mouth."
taurus,2011-08-27,"Your friends may be worried that you could lose your temper, but thankfully you probably have enough self-control now to maintain your cool. It just isn't a good idea to let yourself become unhinged today because reacting spontaneously isn't as effective as sticking to your plan. But there's no need to try to stop your thoughts. Simply add a little time between the flash of awareness and when you actually speak your mind."
gemini,2011-08-27,"If you have been patiently waiting to share your ideas with your friends, your self-imposed silence is nearly over now that your key planet Mercury is moving direct once again. However, you might be tempted to put everything out on the table today, but it's smarter to unveil your new plan slowly over the next few days as Mercury gets back up to speed. It's to your advantage to build up interest gradually, even if you must delay the big show until tomorrow."
cancer,2011-08-27,"Although the Moon has moved on to showy Leo, energetic Mars is still in your cautious sign, encouraging you to be patient. However, you must be very careful today, for you're traveling through some very tricky territory as high-frequency Uranus elevates your anxiety level. Don't slip into denial in order to avoid an uncomfortable feeling. Throwing a temper tantrum won't solve anything, either. Keep as calm as you can by breathing through the stress until it passes on its own."
leo,2011-08-27,"You may think that you'll be able to accomplish a lot today if you don't draw too much attention to yourself. Although this might sound like a good idea, it will be difficult to remain out of the spotlight now that the Moon is back in your demonstrative sign. There are many exciting possibilities that lure you into action so that others can't help but notice you. It really doesn't matter if you are seen or not; just don't purposefully seek the spotlight if you want to finish all your work."
virgo,2011-08-27,"Your discerning analysis works well for you while the Sun and Venus are in your intelligent sign. However, the moody Moon's conjunction with rational Mercury can muddle your logic today, making it impossible to think clearly. You might not be able to delay an important decision; just make sure that you separate your personal desires from the facts so you can remain as objective as possible."
libra,2011-08-27,"You don't like always being the one that everyone relies on to settle a dispute. In fact, you would like to relinquish some of your responsibilities today. However, this won't likely happen as soon as you wish. Even if you are frustrated and tempted to walk away from something important now, don't do it. Wait a day or two for your objectivity to return prior to making any significant decisions."
scorpio,2011-08-27,"You are motivated to talk about your feelings today, but you might feel that anything you say won't bring the results you seek. Others may be open to hearing your perspective, but that doesn't mean they will agree with you or join in your cause. It may not be the most opportune time to gather support for your plan. Let go of your agenda for now and return to the discussion after tomorrow's New Moon when your chances of success are much better."
sagittarius,2011-08-27,"Job-related stress could drive you right to the edge of a cliff today, but you won't likely slip and fall if you simply keep your eyes on the ground in front of you. However, the excitement may be enough to distract you from your regular routine, and danger can sneak in if the adrenaline rush is just right. Don't allow yourself to become so enamored with the adventure that your judgment grows sloppy. You won't make any tactical errors as long as you pay careful attention to every step along the way."
capricorn,2011-08-27,"Your relationships may seem more intense today, requiring you to be more involved than you prefer. You don't want emotional issues to get in the way of your plans, yet it's not easy to extricate yourself from the personal dramas that appear at your doorstep. However, you would be smart to consider if your intended retreat is truly based on practical matters or if you simply want to avoid your own discomfort with the situation. Don't withdraw from intimacy because you are scared; show your courage by facing your fears instead."
aquarius,2011-08-27,"You may feel a bit off center today and could respond inappropriately if you don't take the time to think first. The Sun illuminates your key planet Uranus, zapping you with ingenious ideas that may or may not be of use in the real world. Nevertheless, these thoughts open your mind to new horizons. Still, your smartest strategy now is to sit with your altered perspective for a bit instead of turning your world upside down too quickly."
pisces,2011-08-27,"You are acutely tuned in to your instincts today and might believe that you know what to do at each surprising twist or turn. Overall, your hunches should lead you in the right direction, but be careful; you could miss something important if you become overconfident, only to discover that you are heading down a dead-end street. Restore balance by adding a little common sense to your intuitive approach."
aries,2011-08-28,"You are eager to move into new territory, but the cautious Virgo New Moon in your 6th House of Habits holds you back until you have enough data to make an informed decision. Unfortunately, you could be attached to your old routine, making it difficult to initiate change, even if you know that it's necessary. Thankfully, you could successfully launch a new project this week if you have enough courage to take a radical approach to what you're doing. Don't worry about what others think; do what you know is right."
taurus,2011-08-28,"You must plan ahead now if you want to have time to relax later on. Although the New Moon lands in your 5th House of Love and Creativity, she trines potent Pluto in your 9th House of Long-Term Goals, requiring that you keep an eye on the future. Thankfully, you could be rewarded with an enjoyable experience that you'll long remember if you are able to stay productive today. Having fun is easier if you're doing something of value at the same time."
gemini,2011-08-28,"You want your plans to unfold perfectly today, but your anxiety won't likely show if you end up falling short of your expectations. The exacting Virgo New Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Security, pressuring you to reconsider the details of your schedule one more time. But even with a lot of preparation, you still won't be ready for what actually happens with emotionally intense Pluto in the picture. Letting go of your expectations will ease your worry while also adding an edge of excitement to your day."
cancer,2011-08-28,"The logical Virgo New Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication, increasing the pace and the variety of interactions in your life. You can't allow distractions to pull you off course today because others have placed their faith in you and are counting on you to deliver on your promises. Practicing self-discipline will help you to get more done, but don't close yourself off to the amazing growth you could experience if you wander off the beaten path for a while."
leo,2011-08-28,"You may feel very connected with your core beliefs today with the pragmatic Virgo New Moon falling in your 2nd House of Self-Worth. However, your strong convictions can put you in touch with others who are also passionate about their beliefs -- creating the potential for new relationships to form. Just don't act so cocky that you miss the opportunity to learn about other people's perspectives, too. Gentle but persistent questioning is better now than none at all."
virgo,2011-08-28,"Today's reactive New Moon in your competent sign stimulates your 1st House of Personality, marking a turning point in a relationship. You may be debating with yourself whether or not you should go forward and deepen an existing commitment or create a new one. Although you may consider making enduring changes, your practical approach enables you to see a variety of possible outcomes to your current situation. Entertain as many options as possible before choosing any one of them."
libra,2011-08-28,"You have plenty to gain by listening to your imagination today. The orderly Virgo New Moon is in your 12th House of Dreams, encouraging you to dive into your fantasies. She can spice up your life and inspire you throughout the day, giving you the structure you need to meditate, practice yoga or join a spiritual community. These are exciting times, so center yourself while waiting for the fun to begin."
scorpio,2011-08-28,"Today's picky Virgo New Moon intensifies your 11th House of Groups and her trine to your ruling planet Pluto empowers you with extra physical stamina. You are able to get along well with others now, but may be torn between doing something fun with your friends and breaking away from the gang to express your individuality. Preferably, you'd like to do both, but that seems unlikely so just make your choice and stick with it for the best results."
sagittarius,2011-08-28,"Today's New Moon activates your 10th House of Public Responsibility, demanding that you acknowledge your role within your community or at your workplace. Others seem to place a lot of stock in what you say now, even if you lack self-confidence. Consider the impact of your words because you could inadvertently stir up a complicated issue that could be avoided. Exercising caution is the smartest way to steer clear of trouble."
capricorn,2011-08-28,"Today's practical Virgo New Moon lands in your 9th House of Adventure, encouraging you to dream of grandiose schemes and exotic places. Her harmonious trine to powerful Pluto in your sign strengthens your resolve to get what you want. But you may not be ready yet to initiate action. Nevertheless, making concrete plans now can better your chances of turning them into reality later on."
aquarius,2011-08-28,"You may have some very practical thinking to do if you are considering the purchase of a home, an automobile or some other jointly owned property. Even going in on a small investment now can be profitable because wealthy Pluto trines the earthy Virgo New Moon in your 8th House of Shared Resources. If your intuition is telling you to take a calculated risk today, the probability of success is high."
pisces,2011-08-28,"The discriminating Virgo New Moon visits your 7th House of Relationships today and brings powerful feelings to the surface. If you've been waiting for the right moment to share something that's been on your mind, don't skirt around the edges any longer. Fortunately, others may think that you're more charming now than usual, even if you raise a difficult issue for discussion, so jump right in when you have the chance."
aries,2011-08-29,"You're not interested in seeing both sides of an argument today, especially if you believe that your perspective is the correct one. However, you will enjoy yourself more and won't sacrifice anything in the process if you remain open to someone else's opinion, too. There's no need to be so firm in your convictions that you arouse unnecessary conflict. Just remember that even if you listen to what others have to say, you can still remain true to your beliefs."
taurus,2011-08-29,"This could be a highly creative day for you, but you have to take advantage of the opportunities now presented to you. Although you may have serious obligations to fulfill, don't let them prevent you from having fun. Make use of your determination; once you set your mind on something today, there's a very good chance you'll actually be able to reach your goal. Accomplishments may not come easily, but fortunately, your concentration should pay off."
gemini,2011-08-29,"You can be the champion of procrastination when an unpleasant task needs to be completed. Be careful now, for you may be able to get away with postponing a difficult conversation for another day or two. Just remember that the inevitable cannot be delayed forever. You're better off jumping into the emotional abyss sooner than later. Take advantage of the current support you are receiving, for it could begin to fade tomorrow."
cancer,2011-08-29,"You may encounter circumstances beyond your control that give you good reason to fret today. Thankfully, you should be able to manage the emotional tension and channel it to increase your productivity. A powerful person may be surprised by your ability to maintain your composure under fire and your willingness to do whatever is necessary to succeed. Don't bother attempting to impress anyone; just make sure you do what you need to do to thrive in the current storm."
leo,2011-08-29,"The unflappable strength of your convictions is your secret weapon today. Others may think that you're overly eager to please, but actually you're driven now by an overwhelming sense of practicality and you won't let anyone pull you off course. Saving dramatic expressions of your feelings for another day heightens your efficiency. If negative emotions arise, it's okay to temporarily hide your annoyance or anger until they pass."
virgo,2011-08-29,"You are in your own earthy element today and eager to start a project or just have some fun. But even if you have an overall sense of well-being, you are still sensitive enough to feel a tempest brewing. Although you want to be safe and sound if a storm hits, there's no reason to cancel your social activities or postpone any scheduled plans. Enjoy yourself for the next few days while you still can."
libra,2011-08-29,"It's a bit unsettling for you to feel so peaceful while others think you're being ambivalent. However, you know when it's wise to keep your emotions to yourself. Trust your hunches now; you're probably more in touch with your intuition while the Moon is in your sign than you realize. But don't worry if you say more than you intended because everything's going to come out into the open soon enough. In the meantime, relax and enjoy the calm while it lasts."
scorpio,2011-08-29,"Your perceptions are quite keen today and it's unlikely that anyone will be able to fool you. Still, you could have a difficult time focusing your attention on the present moment now because three planets in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals indicate that you are concentrating on the future. However, there aren't any shortcuts and it will take time for you to reach your destination. Thankfully, your unrelenting determination may be just what you need to get you there."
sagittarius,2011-08-29,"You are all about getting ahead at work today and can make a lot of progress if you put your mind to it. Fortunately, this is a great time to organize your life, and it's wise to start by reprioritizing your goals. Even if you already know where you want to go, stopping to redefine your objectives is the most useful thing you can do right now. Once you make a decision about your new direction, sit with it for a few days before doing anything about it to make sure that your optimism doesn't get the best of you."
capricorn,2011-08-29,"You are feeling good enough today that you are tempted to take on too much, but five planets in practical Earth signs make it more likely that you'll be guided by your common sense. Ultimately, you're able to strike a comfortable balance between your need to get things done in a timely manner and your desire to kick back and relax. Luckily, the planets are supporting you now, making it easy to succeed, no matter what you decide to do."
aquarius,2011-08-29,"You seem to possess a magic bullet today that enables you to dissipate the stress as quickly as it continues to build. However, even though you can stay mellow, your problems won't vanish just because you want them to go away. You'll have to face the music sooner or later and, since you currently have excellent support from the cosmos, it might just as well be now."
pisces,2011-08-29,"Although your relationship troubles aren't over, your positive attitude can go a long way today toward soothing a recent upset. Still, your pleasant disposition won't diminish your emotional intensity. Others might see right through your calm veneer and understand how passionate you are about doing the right thing. Nevertheless, you must decide which path you're going to follow, and that can stir up significant conflict along the way."
aries,2011-08-30,"Other people may get on your nerves today if they won't hurry up and make up their minds. You want answers now and can become frustrated when your impatience gets the best of you. Unfortunately, no one seems to share your sense of urgency. It's easier once you admit that this problem is more about your needs than anyone else's shortcomings. Ease up and give your friends a little room to be themselves."
taurus,2011-08-30,"You may lack ambition today, even though you have specific chores that still must be finished. But you might not feel the need to jump in and take care of your duties before heading out for a little fun. Be careful about avoiding your obligations because, ironically, you may not be able to relax enough to enjoy yourself if you act irresponsibly."
gemini,2011-08-30,"You are looking forward to an easygoing day with the Moon entering your 5th House of Fun and Games. However, there is so much happening in your life these days that you might not have enough time to explore new ways to entertain yourself. But don't take out your frustration on others. Even if someone seems to be blocking your progress, it isn't about anyone else's actions. Changing your own attitude is the only way to overcome the resistance you feel today."
cancer,2011-08-30,"You may be unsure about how to handle a family matter today, but it's certainly not because you don't care. Rather, you're so concerned with what's happening that you see the pros and cons of more than one solution. You may even reach a point of frustration and walk away from the whole situation. Don't be a quitter; it's better to just make a choice now, even if you aren't one hundred percent positive in your decision."
leo,2011-08-30,"You might want to play the role of the diplomat today, placing yourself between two other people who are in the middle of an ongoing disagreement. You're able to listen to each version of the story and still remain neutral and levelheaded. Just remember that you aren't the final arbiter of truth and justice. Instead, you'll be most effective if you can simply help the conflicted parties find some common ground on which to stand."
virgo,2011-08-30,"You might not be as in touch with your feelings today as you were over the past few days when the Moon was visiting your sign. Thankfully, you are able to cool off emotionally now, enabling your critical thinking to lead you in a sensible direction. But don't be overly judgmental and end up saying no to everything. Keep in mind that this isn't about lowering your standards; rather, it's about remaining open to unknown possibilities."
libra,2011-08-30,"The Moon returns to your sign today, possibly overwhelming you with powerful feelings. Thankfully, you should be able to keep working toward your goals if you're able to integrate your emotions into what you're doing. You may be sure enough about your ideas that you can easily go along with any group decision. Unfortunately, others may think that your willingness to yield is a sign of weakness. Don't try to convince anyone that they are wrong. Keep your integrity intact and others will shift their assumptions over time."
scorpio,2011-08-30,"You are willing to tell others how you feel, but may not have the need because you're probably a lot more flexible today than you seem. However, you certainly don't want to come across as weak or undecided, so you might just choose a side and then remain loyal to whatever you pick. Ultimately, it doesn't matter if you are right; what's more important now is that you're following your bliss."
sagittarius,2011-08-30,"You would like to participate in some summer fun with your friends today because being in a group of like-minded people is nourishing to your soul. However, you might not be eager to relinquish your authority or let go of control. Ironically, everyone else may believe that you have things more together than you actually do. This is tricky territory; if you don't show some vulnerability now, others may not be able to help you later on when you really need it."
capricorn,2011-08-30,"It feels as if everyone expects you to be able to pull the right answers out of thin air today; however, you may not be willing to play their game. As interested as you are in being correct, you're not as concerned with choosing one solution over another. What's most critical now is to navigate by your own moral compass instead; if you do, you'll find a way out of the current dilemma."
aquarius,2011-08-30,"Everything seems to work well up to a point today. You're willing to create a plan and then execute it, but you must be ready to set it aside if circumstances change and obstacles stand in your path. Instead of attempting to make a run for the finish line, take your time and handle any issues that pop up along the way. Slow and steady wins the race."
pisces,2011-08-30,"You're interested in getting to the bottom of an emotional issue now that could be getting in the way of the intimacy you seek. Discussing your attractions and desires is not enough to deepen the bond, because it becomes harder to talk about your feelings when you're scared of losing your rational perspective. Nevertheless, you're safer today than you realize, so let your emotions wash over you without any fear of drowning."
aries,2011-08-31,"You are more aware of other people's needs today as the Moon visits your 7th House of Relationships. It's easier to put your desires aside, even if only for a while, to make sure that everyone else is at ease. Although you want to do what's best, your patience is tested later in the day when the Moon squares your key planet Mars, provoking you to be more assertive. You'll be happier if you can find healthy ways to express your energy instead of letting frustration get the best of you."
taurus,2011-08-31,"You might feel as if you have too many chores to do today and are anxious that you cannot possibly finish all of them. Although you want to meet your obligations, worrying won't help. You might even be so overwhelmed now that you consider just throwing in the towel. However, quitting isn't the answer; instead, establish an even pace and simply do the best you can."
gemini,2011-08-31,"The Moon's current visit to your 5th House of Fun and Frivolity allows you to temporarily avoid serious issues. However, austere Saturn won't let you lighten up too much unless you work extra hard first. Take care of your responsibilities early in the day so you can have a bit of down time later. Don't begrudge the lessons you're learning now; they will put you in good stead for what comes next."
cancer,2011-08-31,"You wish you could be objective, but your strong judgments can entangle you in an uncomfortable situation today. You should be able to regain your equilibrium by remembering to balance your subjectivity with cool logic, but your interactions may still be a bit unfulfilling now. Thankfully, you'll probably feel more in your own element by tomorrow."
leo,2011-08-31,"You might feel as if the good times are slipping away, along with the heat of the late summer Sun. You're tempted to do something for the sheer sake of your own personal enjoyment today, but current obligations require your attention first. It's not easy to be flexible once you've made up your mind, but changing your schedule allows you to accommodate both work and play."
virgo,2011-08-31,"The idea of skipping out on work might be appealing today, but it's not going to happen with the Moon conjunct hard-nosed Saturn. Even if you have conjured up a bullet-proof scheme, you may need to re-evaluate your priorities and save the fun and games for another day. Instead, concentrate your energy on doing something that will either bring in additional money or cut back on some expenses. Managing your resources well is more important now than having a good time."
libra,2011-08-31,"You can turn a challenging situation into your advantage today and, luckily, this helps someone close to you have an easier time, too. You perform gracefully under pressure now that the Moon is back in your diplomatic sign and gaining strength from her conjunction to stabilizing Saturn. Others look to you for answers, but you don't have any to give them. However, you do have the ability to help people find common ground and this may be better than any quick fix you might offer."
scorpio,2011-08-31,"The Moon in your 12th House of Soul Awareness can enrich your spiritual journey now, and her proximity to realistic Saturn makes sure that you get the lesson you need to learn. You may uncover a whole new dimension of beauty while managing the most mundane issues of your life. Don't give in to fear; it has no useful place in your current world. Instead of worrying about abandonment, focus on the love that you can spread because it will resonate and come back to you many times over."
sagittarius,2011-08-31,"Your responsibilities may seem overwhelming today, but your attitude will improve if you simply step back from your work for a bit and reconsider your long-term goals. This isn't about creating a new strategy or setting a new course of action; there will be time for that later. It's sufficient to acknowledge several different scenarios without picking one. Think of your options, but wait to narrow your path until you are very clear about where you're going."
capricorn,2011-08-31,"The fair-minded Libra Moon is moving through your 10th House of Status, reminding you to be objective as you handle issues that concern others. Even if you have a specific point of view, don't let it interfere with your decisions today. Setting aside your personal feelings is the right thing to do now, but only if you do it out of deep conviction and not just because you think that you should."
aquarius,2011-08-31,"The airy Libra Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas raises your hopes about what's next in your life. Maybe you're thinking about taking a trip or beginning a new course of study. Whatever you are planning now, keep an open mind and expand your horizons. Don't close down prematurely; your optimal future is not about maintaining the status quo. Stretch your wings and see where your vision takes you."
pisces,2011-08-31,"Although close relationships may be on your mind now, you're not satisfied with simply meeting your commitments. You want to increase the intensity and depth in your intimate interactions, and won't be satisfied until it happens. Thankfully, the Moon's current visit to your 8th House of Deep Sharing helps to create the environment necessary for the kind of emotional connection you want."
aries,2011-09-01,"You are eager to begin something new, yet you don't always finish everything you start. You're tired of all the running around, especially if you haven't accomplished as much as you expected. You may not want to wait another day or two in order to take charge of your own life again. But you can't rush events that are out of your control, so patience is in order."
taurus,2011-09-01,"You are smart to get your job done early in the day, for you might be less inclined to work hard and be productive later in the afternoon and evening. However, if you do fall behind, don't worry. You're bound to get back in the groove over the next couple of days by reclaiming your center and planting your feet firmly back on the ground."
gemini,2011-09-01,"Your sense of urgency isn't the best indicator of timing today, especially if you fear that you're near the end of a road. Your tendency is to start something different now in order to revitalize your life with an exciting project. However, you're much better off waiting until some stability returns before adding anything new to the mix. In the meantime, slow down and tie up as many loose ends as you can."
cancer,2011-09-01,"You may be quite upbeat today, for you can tell that there are big changes ahead. Sometimes you prefer to retreat when things get hectic, but now you are eager to engage the energy head-on. You might realize that you've taken on more than you can manage, making these next few days intense. But one thing is certain: this could be your chance to feel the full passion of life."
leo,2011-09-01,"You are able to hold steady in the midst of big changes, and you're running through your possible strategies today in anticipation of what's coming. You don't mind dealing with the intensity of your feelings or with those of others, but there could be a severe learning curve ahead. Withdrawing your energy from social activities in the community and refocusing at home may be all that's needed to rebalance your life."
virgo,2011-09-01,"Don't let any distractions hook you today or you'll quickly be pulled off course. You're all fired up and feel as if you are on a mission, so you may appear even more driven than usual. Be engaged, but cool your emotions with sound logic. On the other hand, don't spend too much time justifying all your actions or you could fall behind and lose your opportunity to make something awesome happen."
libra,2011-09-01,"You may try to hold on to your neutrality but something has to give now. You know that it's time to make your move when the Moon enters incisive Scorpio today. Fortunately, ambiguity quickly becomes a thing of the past; you know exactly where you stand and there's no question about where you are going. Others are wise to take their cues from you or just get out of your way."
scorpio,2011-09-01,"The Moon's monthly return to your sign isn't always an easy process because you feel even more strongly than usual, which can be rather overwhelming to those close to you. But it probably takes more effort to hide your feelings now than to express them. However, it can be an emotionally charged day if your secrets are revealed. Luckily, intimacy is within reach if you are willing to demonstrate your vulnerability."
sagittarius,2011-09-01,"You are usually a straight shooter with your emotions, yet you don't necessarily like to dwell on them. You prefer to let your actions speak for you, but now you might actually have something to hide. Luckily, keeping your feelings to yourself is easy today with the Moon's presence in your private 12th House. If you want to take the focus off of your inner process, there's a lot to discuss about all the developments at work."
capricorn,2011-09-01,"It's possible to delay a necessary confrontation for a day or two now, but it's not advisable. Your emotions could trigger a meltdown if you don't face them sooner than later. It might seem as if you are hitting the proverbial wall today, but this could be a projection of your inner turmoil. When you stop trying to control all of the changes, your stress may dissipate on its own."
aquarius,2011-09-01,"You want to take care of everyone at work today, but you might have to set aside your own feelings in the process. Unfortunately, it's all too easy for your unexpressed negativity to turn into anger or resentment, which doesn't help you get along with anyone. Nevertheless, latching onto a ray of hope can be enough to encourage you not to lose confidence. Focusing your attention on the possibilities will keep you in a positive frame of mind."
pisces,2011-09-01,"You may be energetically reserved today, even if your hopes are still pinned to a shooting star that's on its way upward. However, your intensity can be disproportionately dramatic when you finally tell your story. But be careful; everything doesn't need to come out in the open now. It's an emotional process and if you do it gradually, it will be easier on everyone involved."
aries,2011-09-02,"You may be caught up in a complex swirl of energy as you attempt to untangle your attachments. Although you might try to be impartial in your approach to relationships today, you could have a tough decision to make now that could ultimately change the trajectory of your life. Fortunately, your clear intentions help you spin the current circumstances in a way that's beneficial to all involved."
taurus,2011-09-02,"You are quite determined to avoid an unpleasant confrontation today because you cannot see how it will lead to anything positive. It's easier for you to sit on the fence now and wait for resolution than to get caught up in making something happen. But inaction will only work for so long. Ultimately, you'll feel better after the various opinions have been aired, even if there's no apparent common ground yet. There's no need to force a group consensus; it will come naturally on its own."
gemini,2011-09-02,"Your ruling planet Mercury the Communicator might appear to be no match while standing up to transformative Pluto today; but your thoughts will endure, even if your priorities change. Holding onto your vision helps you face a difficult opponent. You may feel that someone is out to defeat you, but if you're smart enough to steer clear of open conflict now, you should be able to continue toward your destination without further interference."
cancer,2011-09-02,"You are challenged to show your feelings with Mars now back in your sign. Your life may seem overly intense now, and it feels like there's too much going on, making it nearly impossible to know where to start. Although overcoming your hesitation is wise, don't share everything at once. Choose your topics of discussion carefully; emphasizing those things you can be optimistic about should help you reach your goals."
leo,2011-09-02,"You may be feeling a bit embarrassed today if you recently went out on a limb and said more than was necessary. However hopeful you are that others can step beyond their narrow-minded thinking to see the big picture, you still face an uphill battle. Attempts to demonstrate your intellectual superiority are bound to fail. Instead of making anyone else feel like a loser, figure out how everyone can win."
virgo,2011-09-02,"Although you realize the significance of your own core beliefs, it's difficult when someone close to you has an entirely different set of assumptions. However, it's a trap to engage in dialogue solely for the purpose of proving you are right. Once you acknowledge that intelligent people can hold opposing views, you will be free to work on self-improvement instead of wasting time trying to change another person's mind."
libra,2011-09-02,"Mercury's current visit to playful Leo makes you more talkative and increases your mental activity, but you may need to fight for your right to speak your mind. Fortunately, your creative juices are flowing directly from the source now, making it easier to be proactive. Being considerate of other people's feelings is admirable, but don't allow your willingness to compromise stop you from doing what's best for you."
scorpio,2011-09-02,"The Moon's return to your suspicious sign can raise issues of jealousy or possessiveness in relationships. You may think that someone is working against you behind your back, but it may just be your fears stirring up these fantasies. Don't succumb to the negativity today; the choice is truly yours. Choosing self-improvement over everything else should be enough to put a positive spin on the day."
sagittarius,2011-09-02,"Your key planet Jupiter forms an optimistic trine with the illuminating Sun today, lifting your spirits and raising your hopes. Luckily, your cheerful attitude can positively impact your immediate future, but self-doubt could also surface and temporarily interfere with a good day. Connect with your friends because they will help take your mind off of your problems and remind you of what's most important."
capricorn,2011-09-02,"You may lock horns with a friend and find yourself in a standoff today, especially if you feel threatened by your own insecurity. But other people's clever ideas are no match for your unrelenting persistence and strong sense of purpose. Although someone may anger you now, don't get distracted from your ambitious goals. Your current optimism, mixed with intense concentration, is an unbeatable combination."
aquarius,2011-09-02,You have the gift of clear vision and shouldn't let anyone dismiss your dreams today. But things get tricky fast if someone questions your authority. Your energy could shift into a more aggressive mood if you attempt to defend yourself. Don't bother trying to justify your position now. Just keep your eyes on the horizon and continue heading in that direction.
pisces,2011-09-02,"Although everything seems quite intense, you are able to stay slightly detached from your emotions today. Luckily, your optimistic perspective on relationships enables you to avoid an unnecessary conflict with someone who fundamentally disagrees with your position. Remember that you don't have to be right; you have absolutely nothing to prove now. Instead of stirring up trouble with a loved one,  concentrate on realizing your dreams."
aries,2011-09-03,"What you say today has more impact than usual so remember to choose your words very carefully. Instead of impulsively blabbering away about whatever comes to mind, consider what you want before you speak. However, keep in mind your natural tendency is to overlook the details. Use positive images to inspire others, but don't gloss over what's important just because it doesn't support your vision."
taurus,2011-09-03,"Your ability to say exactly the right thing can help you through a tricky situation today, while allowing you to inadvertently promise more than you can deliver. Unfortunately, you may not realize what you've said until it's too late. Speaking before you think increases the stress;  make sure to balance any positive immediate effect with the potential long-term consequences."
gemini,2011-09-03,"Daydreaming is a great way to visualize different scenarios before you pick out the right one to follow. Your thoughts can take you on a spectacular journey today; however, individually each one seems so good that you simply cannot make up your mind. There isn't any reason to force making a choice right away, so just enjoy the present moment while it lasts."
cancer,2011-09-03,You may be a bit detached from everyone around you today. It's as if getting close to someone now activates a memory of an old emotional wound. But don't be too harsh a critic because your energy will continue to morph and change. Practice letting go of your desire to control everything; your adaptability helps you turn a complex day into a simply joyous one.
leo,2011-09-03,"You might be feeling sorry for yourself today, especially if others tell you that you should be living a less complicated life. But you recently made decisions that suggest you like to have a variety of options at your disposal. However, don't waste too much energy arguing with anyone else or you'll wear yourself out before you can make the right choice. Ultimately, the only person you have to please is yourself."
virgo,2011-09-03,"The Moon's stressful square with motor-mouthed Mercury reminds you to forget about your worries and see how far you can take one great idea, instead. But it's not a day of impractical fantasies, so don't bother trying to escape from the practical side of life. Keep your feet firmly planted on the ground, even while allowing new ideas to inspire your dreams."
libra,2011-09-03,"You may feel optimistic today, but it's not easy to put your big ideas into action. Your patience will ultimately be rewarded, freeing you to talk about your plans. Once the Moon enters fiery Sagittarius in the afternoon you remember how much fun you can have when you take off on an adventure. Don't hold back; start something new and exciting when the universe tells you that it's time."
scorpio,2011-09-03,"Although you may begin the day with a high level of anxiety, your current emotional overload may be exactly the catalyst you need. You might prefer to keep quiet now, because once you begin sharing you could end up saying way more than you originally intended. Don't worry if you overreact in the early morning, for there's still time to find your way back to a more comfortable place later in the day."
sagittarius,2011-09-03,"The Moon's return to your extroverted sign this afternoon is an exciting wake-up call. You can consciously set patterns for the next couple of weeks, but it may be smarter to simply focus on what's happening in the immediate moment, instead. Once the reset is complete and you are fully engaged in the here-and-now, it becomes much easier to imagine the amazing possibilities of the future."
capricorn,2011-09-03,"You may still be on your guard today, especially if you recently had a few days of very intense interactions. Unfortunately, the lack of any real romance on your horizon could be the source of your unhappiness. Fortunately, you can shift your attention to seek satisfaction professionally. You're a champion when it comes to working hard and now this innate characteristic pays off handsomely. But even if you are proud of your accomplishments, don't totally ignore your heart."
aquarius,2011-09-03,"You are blessed with the gift of gab now and everywhere you turn, the words just fall right out of your mouth. You love to talk about your recent experiences, yet this isn't a time to reminisce about past achievements. Throw caution to the wind and open your mind to a wide variety of possibilities before settling down and choosing one. Visualizing your future is the first step to creating your dreams."
pisces,2011-09-03,"Others may get lost as they try to follow your thinking today because your thoughts are slipping in and out of fantasies and parallel universes, making everything quite complex. But even if you can't untangle your words, you still can reach your audience in other ways by playing a song, reading a poem or drawing a picture. Set aside your tech manuals and science books for now and let your creative genius shine."
aries,2011-09-04,"The influence you have on others now is not limited to what they can see; opinions are being formed today by picking up on more subtle information, too. Placing too much emphasis on the performance may have you looking good but won't necessarily convey the real substance of what you have to offer. Be smart and save your act for another day. For now, concentrate on working with the major changes that are slowly yet methodically unfolding around you."
taurus,2011-09-04,"The Moon's square to your key planet Venus can prompt you to declare your feelings right out loud today, even if this isn't your normal style. However, you would be smart to think twice before doing anything that could upset the delicate balance between you and others. Your life is already more complicated than you like, so don't add another layer of drama on top of everything else. For simplicity's sake, keep your desires to yourself for now."
gemini,2011-09-04,"You might feel as if you've recently navigated your way successfully through a tricky situation. Now that you have demonstrated your skills as a negotiator by convincing someone to avoid direct confrontation, it's your turn to take a stand for one of your beliefs. Although this may require methodical follow-through on your part, you could be pleasantly surprised with the outcome."
cancer,2011-09-04,"You want to move beyond your recently hurt feelings, but it's not easy to let go of them if someone is being inconsiderate today. Still, it's crucial to realize that you can't control how people react to you, even if you're tempted to manipulate their emotions. Instead of attempting to change anyone else, find a place of acceptance within yourself that can transform your fears into a positive expression of love."
leo,2011-09-04,"You are ready to put your best foot forward today because the Moon in your expressive 5th House wants you to be noticed now by all those you love. Luckily, your charm can cut right through a stressful situation, leaving others to appreciate your presence. Unfortunately, you can try too hard. Knowing when to step out of the spotlight is just as important as having an entertaining act to perform. Once you've had your moment to shine, be gracious and let someone else be the center of attention for a while."
virgo,2011-09-04,"You're stressed by today's conflict between your desire for adventure and your need for perfection. You're tempted to sacrifice quality in order to squeeze more activity into your day, but you may regret this kind of foolish behavior later on. Your friends and family might not even be aware of your current struggle unless you decide to make your feelings public. Keep in mind that your experience doesn't depend on anyone else knowing about it."
libra,2011-09-04,"You may be worried about an uncomfortable situation with a friend, but it's hard to tell if it's real or if you're just making it all up. Interactive Mercury in your 11th House of Social Networking forms an otherworldly septile with realistic Saturn in your sign. While it's true that someone could be trying to undermine your position today, it's smarter to avoid the drama. Have fun, but keep working until you fulfill the promises you made."
scorpio,2011-09-04,"You're feeling a lot of pressure that seems to fall squarely on your shoulders now, but fortunately you know that your efforts are appreciated. The uplifting Sagittarius Moon in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem reminds you to look on the bright side of things, boosting your confidence. But don't waste energy pretending that you are okay with things as they are if you're not. Take time to process your feelings; ultimately, releasing them will bring you increased vitality."
sagittarius,2011-09-04,"The Moon's monthly visit to your sign raises your spirits and encourages you to share your positive outlook with those around you. Unfortunately, your overconfidence can carry you away today, allowing you to appear a bit foolish. It's great to have such an optimistic attitude, but you could lose support from your closest friends unless you are also willing to acknowledge the more difficult aspects of life, too."
capricorn,2011-09-04,"You are motivated by your desire to maintain your balance, but this can be tricky when the ground is constantly shifting beneath your feet. You can see many exciting possibilities ahead, but are also fearful that you could lose your sense of direction if you let yourself be distracted by pleasure. Thankfully, you have enough discipline to stay on track now as long as you remain true to yourself."
aquarius,2011-09-04,"Although your friends are probably being straightforward today, there's a good chance that you'll still misinterpret what they say. Relationships are complicated by unexpressed feelings now, especially if others think that you won't approve of their desires. If you want someone you love to share their secrets with you, you'll need to create a safe space by demonstrating your willingness to be open-minded and non-judgmental."
pisces,2011-09-04,"Even if you don't feel like doing your chores or fulfilling your duties, you're still able to make it look like you're having fun while doing your work. You are willing to turn your routine into a game, which alleviates boredom and can actually make your life more pleasurable. However, caution is advised, because there may be a price to pay for keeping your real feelings secret. It may be wiser to just be honest from the beginning because unexpressed negativity can often turn into resentment if it doesn't have an outlet."
aries,2011-09-05,"Your overconfidence can create problems today, unless you scale back your ambitions a bit. Unfortunately, it's hard to tell where to draw the line between reality and fantasy, making your decisions even more difficult. Widening your spiritual horizons is easy now; maintaining a solid connection with the mundane world at the same time is more difficult, yet also worth the effort."
taurus,2011-09-05,"Your current fascination with philosophy tempts you to believe that you have discovered the meaning of life. Unfortunately, others might see things differently today, believing that you are evading the important issues by using big words and talking about complex ideas that are removed from what's actually happening. Although your search for truth may appear cavalier, there's no need to change anything now as long as you're respectful to the reactions of those around you."
gemini,2011-09-05,"Thankfully, the pace of life may be a bit slower today, but you still wish that things would return to normal. Still, you have a chance to review your recent experiences and think about what to do next. Just remember that there is a magnifying lens between you and your world now, making everything appear bigger, better or more important than it truly is. Giving yourself a reality check is healthier than waiting for someone else to do it for you."
cancer,2011-09-05,"Today your false sense of optimism may have you believing that anything you can imagine will come true. Although your positive attitude might be sufficient to tip the scales in your favor, there are other things that should be considered, too. It's not necessary to give up as long as you're willing to face the current difficulties. Fortunately, it will be easier to overcome any obstacles in your path once you first acknowledge them."
leo,2011-09-05,"You could be at the top of your game now, yet still may be insecure about a close relationship because you're not seeing the situation in its true light. The truth is that your self-image could suffer if you spend too much time analyzing what's going on. You're probably more creative and refined than you realize now. Change your attitude by deciding to project yourself into the future instead of looking back into the past."
virgo,2011-09-05,"Your innate tendency to be discriminating is  always useful, but now it can turn into an obsession and get in the way of your happiness. You may grow uncomfortable with your current starry-eyed visions and decide to rein in your fantasies. Unfortunately, you could pull back so far that your caution causes you to miss out on a lovely opportunity. You don't need to lower your standards as long as you remain open to starting small and growing from there."
libra,2011-09-05,"You may have unresolved issues that linger from a recent emotional meltdown. Although your feelings probably won't be put to rest, you have a chance to raise your game to a higher level now. Instead of struggling for dominance or survival, shift your focus to more spiritual concerns. The real magic isn't in the physical world today. You will be able to let go of unnecessary resentment if you act with compassion instead of fear."
scorpio,2011-09-05,"You might want to establish new financial goals now that the Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Wealth. However, there is a deep connection between your self-esteem and your net worth. Obviously, there are many practical things you can do to augment your income and increase your assets, but today an attitude change might be more important than anything else. If you value yourself, it will be easier in the long run for others to invest in you."
sagittarius,2011-09-05,"It's not easy to keep your feelings secret now because they're obvious to others, even if you don't express them directly. The moody Moon is visiting your 1st House of Personality and she has her own language that bypasses words and social pleasantries. Nevertheless, it's unwise to assume that others know what's going on for you unless you actually take the time to specifically tell them. Confiding in someone you trust will make you feel instantly better."
capricorn,2011-09-05,"The Moon's presence in your 12th House of Privacy raises conflicts between your need to be constantly in the world doing your thing and your current desire to isolate yourself so you can work in solitude. Neither extreme is an acceptable course of action now, even if you think that you must choose one way or the other today. Change the rules of the game by imagining a scenario where you can be in the spotlight when necessary, yet are still able to escape when you need to be alone."
aquarius,2011-09-05,"You're motivated by your dreams now that the adventurous Sagittarius Moon is in your 11th House of Future Goals. Unfortunately, you might not have enough common sense to know which of your ideas are good enough to follow and which should be set aside. Luckily, you don't have to decide today; just allow your thoughts to take you on a fascinating ride without being bound to any single outcome."
pisces,2011-09-05,"The Moon's current visit to your 10th House of Career encourages you to make big plans to fulfill your professional ambitions. Although you may feel as if you're sitting on top of the world -- or, at least have a clear path to the  mountain's summit -- others may not see your success in the same way. Don't be discouraged by the doubters and naysayers; go ahead and reach for the stars. Just remember to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground at the same time."
aries,2011-09-06,"You have good intentions, but you may have trouble keeping quiet today. You might even know that what you are about to say really should be left unspoken, but you could blurt it out anyway in a moment of excitement. Obviously, once your words are out in the open, you can't take them back. Of course, honesty is the best policy, but remember to think before you speak and to always be kind in your delivery."
taurus,2011-09-06,"You can perceive things that you would ordinarily miss on other days, prompting you to be a bit more intense now than usual. You're sure that your conclusions are right and could easily take it upon yourself to help others see the future just as you do. But there is danger in assuming that there is one single outcome and you already know what it is. Be smart and entertain all possibilities before fixing on only one."
gemini,2011-09-06,"You are spinning a lot of wheels in your head, but it's probably wise to keep most of your thoughts to yourself today. Your ideas are likely quite good, but everyone will assume your thinking is scattered if you keep changing your plans, rather than just following through on your established agenda. Fortunately, you can still be more effective than anyone expects once you do make a final decision because you won't let up until you reach your goal."
cancer,2011-09-06,"If you get caught up in an emotional melodrama today, it would be wise to stand back from the situation in order to reassess your involvement. If you decide that it's really not your business, withdrawing your energy is your safest move. However, if participating in this conflict is necessary, at least try to detach yourself from any specific outcome. For now, you will be more valuable if you use your head instead of your heart."
leo,2011-09-06,"Today you may become irritated at someone or something that doesn't usually bother you, yet you can't quite put your finger on the source of your annoyance. Someone may bring up a subject that stirs a deep issue you have been trying to avoid. Now it's time to face the music. Thankfully, your previous angst will begin to dissipate if you can get your feelings out in the open."
virgo,2011-09-06,"You might be disappointed in yourself if you fall short of someone's unrealistic expectations. However, you won't likely sit around long enough to take the heat for something that's beyond your control. You are too results-oriented now to waste time in self-pity or self-doubt. Figure out what went wrong, make a better plan and try again before you lose motivation."
libra,2011-09-06,"It's likely that you've already started to feel the emotional intensity waning; however, this doesn't mean that your opinions will become any less extreme today. You could be unusually adamant about what you know to be true and might be uncharacteristically impatient with someone who attempts to change your mind. Fortunately, this is a chance to practice listening extra carefully to what others say without necessarily agreeing with any of their conclusions."
scorpio,2011-09-06,"You may feel overwhelmed as Mars in your 9th House of Future Vision quintiles excessive Jupiter, making it easy for you to take on too much. Additionally, the Sun's fateful septile to Mars indicates that something unexpected can happen that could ultimately require you to change your travel schedule. Thankfully, you're able to clear the air by saying what's on your mind. Others will hear your message if you are honest and don't attempt to blame anyone else for your current predicament."
sagittarius,2011-09-06,"You can see through the excuses of those around you and your incisive observations could make them quite anxious today. Unfortunately, you could be correct in your assumptions yet still make matters worse by bringing up a touchy subject in an abrupt or inconsiderate manner. There's no need to avoid an important discussion as long as you steer clear from any form of judgmental behavior. Your open-minded approach puts your associates at ease and also enables them to put aside their own self-righteousness."
capricorn,2011-09-06,"You may be the proverbial go-to person because you usually seem to know what's going to happen. You might have a strong grip on reality now, which does increase your sense of authority. Don't mistakenly assume that your vision is the only answer just because you can navigate your way into the future. Accepting that multiple solutions are possible will earn you even more credibility with your workmates in the long run."
aquarius,2011-09-06,"You have your own objectives today, yet the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Secrets suggests that you need to hide your plans from others. Perhaps you don't want anyone to judge you before you put your new strategy in motion. Or maybe you just want to prove something, so you set out to do it alone. Keep in mind that collaborating with the right person can strengthen your plan and increase your effectiveness."
pisces,2011-09-06,"Your workmates may be particularly critical of your performance, yet you can still learn from what they say today. Unfortunately, you might be closed off to their advice because of your own issues of self-esteem. However, you can see the intrinsic value of this new information once you acknowledge your insecurity. No competition is necessary because everyone can be a winner."
aries,2011-09-07,"Being overly concerned about how others see you isn't your normal style, but the cautious Capricorn Moon in your 10th House of Status requires you to be on your best behavior now. You must proceed carefully, for your natural inclination is to talk before you think. Thankfully, your intuition should show you the most practical course of action, which is exactly what you need."
taurus,2011-09-07,"Everything appears to fall into place today, but, unfortunately, you still may not feel completely at ease. Although it's reassuring that your life has settled down sufficiently for you to have some time to relax, you might think that you're missing something important now. Don't worry about anything that's not concrete. Focusing on reality rather than your anxiety is your best preparation for whatever might occur next."
gemini,2011-09-07,"Accept the support of your closest friends and family today, for they will supply the solid foundation that you might lack on your own. The help you need now isn't about money; it's about knowing that others have faith in you and in what you're doing. Don't wait for someone to offer assistance; ask and you shall receive."
cancer,2011-09-07,"You may be more content with listening to what others want without feeling the necessity to fix anything today. You can be sweet and caring, but it's more important now to fulfill your obligations and make time to meet your own needs, instead. Remember, you will have more to give later on if you feel satisfied yourself."
leo,2011-09-07,"No matter what you feel today, it's best to stick to your regular routine as closely as possible. However, you still must remain flexible enough to handle changing circumstances because unexpected situations may arise that pull you off your normal schedule. Don't be overly rigid when responding to a surprise; instead, just return to the safety of the tried and true as soon as you can."
virgo,2011-09-07,"The Moon brightens your 5th House of Self-Expression, reflecting your current need to tell someone how you feel, especially if there is a romantic attraction. You would prefer to let your love light shine all the time, but sometimes you turn it down low so you can be of service to those who need your help. Now, however, don't deny your desires; let your heart guide your way."
libra,2011-09-07,"You might prefer to hide away at home today, out of sight from the real world. Unfortunately, your little mini-retreat may not work out so well because you still have to go to work or run errands. Being productive is admirable, but don't be afraid to honor your own needs, too. Finish what you start quickly, so you still have some time left over for relaxation later in the day."
scorpio,2011-09-07,"You really want to do something special with your friends or family today, but are hesitant to schedule too much into your day. If you're busy, you may be resistant to the idea of doing more, yet you're likely to enjoy yourself once you get into the flow of events. Don't procrastinate; the sooner you put your calendar in order now, the smoother everything will go."
sagittarius,2011-09-07,"If you aren't in conflict with someone else today, you are probably arguing with yourself. Your thoughts could be leading you around in circles; even if you attempt to stop the inner dialogue, it seems to have a mind of its own. Regain your emotional balance by allowing your mental meanderings to continue without trying to push them away. Paradoxically, once you try to exert control, the cycle restarts for another round."
capricorn,2011-09-07,"Your strong resolve to follow your agenda is being severely tested today and you're ready to bury your feelings if you think that they might get in the way of your progress. Unfortunately, denying your emotions only postpones the inevitable; your repressed energy will come out sooner or later. If tension does escalate, however, the expression can be much more difficult. It's healthier to deal with the consequences as they occur and then let them pass."
aquarius,2011-09-07,"You might not be telling the whole truth about what's happening today because your desire for self-sufficiency encourages you to keep your feelings secret. You don't have a reason to show your vulnerability, which could restrain the intensity of an emotional interaction. There's no right or wrong way to approach a situation now as long as you keep your heart open and act with kindness."
pisces,2011-09-07,"You can count on your friends to come through for you today as the Moon visits your 11th House of Social Networking. Your desires are pretty basic, and thankfully you should be able to get what you want. Ironically, others may not be very demonstrative now, but you still won't have any doubt about their love and support. Don't be afraid to ask for what you need because you'll likely receive it."
aries,2011-09-08,"You often push boundaries without even realizing it when you get excited about something new. However, today's enthusiasm might be more about what you say than what you do with talkative Mercury in the spotlight. The problem is that you may not be on target with your idea, even though you think it's a good one. Don't be so cocky that you make incorrect assumptions. Be patient, review your plans one more time and proceed slowly."
taurus,2011-09-08,"Your career goals may seem more tangible than they actually are with the most unrealistic ones right at the tips of your outreached fingers. On the plus side, you can believe an impossible dream is so real that your legendary persistence makes it so. But on the other hand, it's easy to become complacent by convincing yourself that you're close to your destination when you're not. Use your common sense before wasting any more energy pursuing a pipe dream."
gemini,2011-09-08,"The Moon's visit to your 9th House of Higher Education prompts you to reconsider an old plan you had to return to school. Remember, it's wiser to study a subject that expands your mind and widens your perspective beyond your old way of seeing things. But make sure that you don't jump to conclusions or even something as simple as a weekend getaway can turn into a comedy of errors. There's no rush to make a final decision, so give your ideas enough time to develop before doing anything rash."
cancer,2011-09-08,"It's a lot safer to keep your unexpressed emotional desires to yourself now, for your surprising intensity can be unsettling to someone else. Unfortunately, you still must take a chance if you want to experience new levels of intimacy with someone that you trust. Revealing your vulnerability is not without its danger; thankfully, the benefits now outweigh the risks."
leo,2011-09-08,"You might be afraid that something magical could slip through your fingers today, but no amount of logic can help you figure out a sensible strategy to stabilize your position. Attempts to understand a relationship that eludes comprehension can be quite frustrating. An approach based upon analysis will only bring you back around to the same old dissatisfaction that you're trying to escape. Let go of your desire to discover any truth other than what's already in your heart."
virgo,2011-09-08,"You have an opportunity to impact your physical well-being now by simply changing your attitude. The Moon's current visit to innovative Aquarius and your 6th House of Health helps you focus your energy toward self-improvement. The powerful effect that positive thinking can have on your life today should not be underestimated. In fact, it just may be the key to a happier and healthier you."
libra,2011-09-08,"You could easily fall in love today, with the Moon's presence in your 5th House of Romance, yet ironically, your feelings may not have much to do with the people in your life. You are more open to the possibility of romance, whether or not you're willing to express your desires. Since a current infatuation could be the result of your daydreams, you really don't require anyone to act out your fantasy. If no one's there, just go ahead and enjoy the fruits of your imagination."
scorpio,2011-09-08,"You think you know how a domestic situation is going to play out over the next few months, especially if you have recently been re-evaluating your long-term goals. However, it's challenging to know what to do because your future still seems like a fantasy and the details of how it will unfold are elusive. Don't try to make up your mind now; instead, give yourself permission to dream without attempting to make anything real yet."
sagittarius,2011-09-08,"Communicating your plans can be frustrating today if you want others to become involved in your project. You may have a lot of information at your disposal, but most of your current data probably lacks substance. Normally you're quite comfortable floating in the realm of abstract ideas because you're a natural philosopher. However, your need to reach a concrete goal now is in conflict with your dreamier thoughts. Nevertheless, making a commitment to something specific will have positive consequences."
capricorn,2011-09-08,"Your ego can get blown out of proportion today as others motivate you to reach for your dreams. Obviously, self-confidence is useful, but too much optimism can annoy those who might otherwise be your allies. Moderating your grandiose thinking with modesty can be a wise strategy. A healthy perspective on life can make all the difference between your success and failure."
aquarius,2011-09-08,"You may have to review your recent commitments and reconsider what you can actually deliver today, for you might have promised others too much. You didn't intend to mislead anyone; everything is just taking longer now than you expected. You may be tempted to quit, but overreacting isn't a good idea. Take a few deep breaths, re-evaluate what is possible and let others know what they can expect from you at this time."
pisces,2011-09-08,"It may be an uphill battle to control your dreams today because they are overflowing out of your sleep and right into your waking life. Obviously, this can be quite confusing if you attempt to rationalize your feelings when your emotions are being fed by unconscious urges. If you're unsure about what to do, step back a bit until your path becomes clear. A temporary retreat is a better strategy than making believe that you can tell what's real."
aries,2011-09-09,"You don't really need to be acknowledged by others today as long as you feel that your life is moving along in the right direction. The Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Long-Term Goals takes your mind off your immediate responsibilities and focuses your thinking on a larger perspective. Don't hide your dreams, even if they distract you from accomplishing practical tasks in the real world."
taurus,2011-09-09,"It may seem like the start of your workweek rather than the beginning of a weekend because the Moon is in your 10th House of Career, reminding you to concentrate on your professional development. Fortunately, the assistance of three planets in hardworking Virgo enables you to do your job well. But don't get lazy; wasting the chance to accomplish something important today could bring regret tomorrow."
gemini,2011-09-09,"It feels as if your head is finally coming out of a fogbank as the clouds dissipate today, allowing you to see the distant horizon. This is a day of reconnecting with your life purpose since your wide-angle vision allows you to gain more perspective. Don't be afraid to choose your new direction now, even if you don't think that it's a final decision. You are closer to the truth than you think."
cancer,2011-09-09,"The Moon's presence in emotionally distant Aquarius and your 8th House of Intimate Relationships confronts you with a peculiar problem. You want the security of deep and long-lasting love, yet your aversion to change can pull you back inside your protective shell. You don't have to alter your approach; just stay aware of the temptation to withdraw from a discussion when emotions heat up and things get intense."
leo,2011-09-09,"The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Companions shifts your focus from personal development and onto the people closest to you. You truly want to be present for a friend who needs you today, but you may resent someone who won't assist you with the same level of commitment that you show for others. It's useless to compare yourself to anyone else; don't jump in to help unless it comes straight from your heart."
virgo,2011-09-09,"You have very specific obligations that you must fulfill and the best way to approach them now is one tiny step at a time. The community-minded Aquarius Moon's presence in your 6th House of Details makes it absolutely necessary for you to think globally while acting locally. Even if your thoughts are on the big picture, it's the little things you do that will have the greatest impact at this time."
libra,2011-09-09,"Your emotions are more in line with the events in your life now that the Moon is in rational Aquarius, a fellow Air sign. Even if you don't feel very enthusiastic, your innocent creativity can turn a boring job into something more enjoyable. But don't get so distracted by having fun that you forget your obligations. Finish up your current tasks so you are ready to start a new project in the next few days."
scorpio,2011-09-09,"You may not be able to explain what you're feeling today because there aren't words to describe your current experiences. It's as if the veil between worlds is thinner now and you are receiving impressions that are not based upon your present reality. Fortunately, there's no need to share your spiritual realizations with anyone else; just bask in your rich inner experience and let it strengthen your conviction in the magical mysteries of the universe."
sagittarius,2011-09-09,"You may feel very social today, even if most of your interactions occur in the workplace. Talkative Mercury, now in your 10th House of Career, tempts you to spend too much time at the water cooler rather than actually working. Fortunately, you are a consummate team player now and will excel at whatever you do because you naturally play well with others."
capricorn,2011-09-09,"You are thinking about all the possibilities ahead with Mercury in analytical Virgo traveling through your 9th House of Big Ideas. Although your best plans can turn into real moneymakers, it could take a while to see the concrete results you want now. Don't try to force an issue today because everything will successfully unfold according to its true internal rhythm if you just show up consistently and give it your all."
aquarius,2011-09-09,"The Moon's visit to independent Aquarius reminds you that you can't always match up to other people's expectations. You want to be a part of your community and a vital player on the team, but you also need to establish your own individuality. Don't worry; you can still be a non-conformist, even while working toward goals that are mutually beneficial."
pisces,2011-09-09,"Your feelings aren't fully integrated with your current experiences, yet that doesn't make your reactions any less intense. Others can easily misunderstand you today, motivating you to keep your inner world private. You can always clarify things later, but for now you don't need to say anything about your dreams. If possible, take some time to process your emotions on your own."
aries,2011-09-10,"You might be stymied today because you want to share what you're feeling, but the current circumstances may require you to wait. Logically, you can understand why it's wise to keep your emotions to yourself, yet you are tempted to bend the rules and say more than is necessary. Remember, it's probably better for everyone involved if you don't act impulsively at this time."
taurus,2011-09-10,"You aren't prepared to say exactly what you are feeling today because you don't want to add to the current drama. However, you're still eager to demonstrate your love and are able to do so in a manner that won't make anyone uncomfortable. Of course, taking a risk by telling someone about your heart's desires can be rather scary, so don't reveal too much too fast."
gemini,2011-09-10,"You have plenty of words right at the tip of your tongue today, even if you're talking about tender feelings that you don't normally share. A combination of circumstances enables you to be secure now, so you are more willing than usual to take an emotional risk. Don't waste too much time worrying about how others will respond. A discussion should unfold naturally as long as you're not too dramatic in your delivery."
cancer,2011-09-10,"You may want to step out of the spotlight today, but chances are you will still receive your fair share of love and admiration, anyway. But trying to hide is just one way to waste precious energy. Push beyond any embarrassment you feel about being the center of attention and graciously accept the positive vibrations that now come your way."
leo,2011-09-10,"Creating emotional boundaries today gives you a safe place to retreat from the big world. Normally, you're eager to put your feelings on the line, without even giving it a second thought. However, your emotions are raw now, and you're not in the mood to share them with everyone. Keep in mind that you don't need to justify your actions; it is always within your power to choose whether or not to talk about your inner process."
virgo,2011-09-10,"Your key planet Mercury is keeping you busy analyzing your insecurities, but your logic can run into walls today as wounded Chiron enters the picture. However, your emotions may be integrated into your overall game plan now. Your friends are likely to respond warmly if you share what's on your mind, but they may be reflecting your current eagerness for affection. Make the most of the positive Venus-Mars aspect by connecting with friends and family, but don't expect too much in return."
libra,2011-09-10,"You may try to avoid being in the public eye today, yet the rewards from your previous work could follow you around and turn the spotlight on you anyway. Even if you're being recognized and appreciated, you would be more comfortable if everyone was receiving acknowledgment and not just you. But rather than diverting the attention back on others, just say thank you while proudly enjoying the moment."
scorpio,2011-09-10,"You aren't in the mood to be the one who puts everything together today. Instead, you want to be pleasantly surprised when you discover that someone special has a dinner or a whole weekend planned especially for you. Although you crave adventure, romance and fun, spending your time waiting for the magic to happen isn't a viable strategy. Don't minimize your current choices; take responsibility for your half of the deal."
sagittarius,2011-09-10,"Feelings of discomfort or anxiety can catch you off guard today if your emotions become more intense than usual. Energetic Mars is in timid Cancer and your 8th House of Intimacy, preventing you from sharing your romantic insecurities. Don't get hooked into believing that someone is going to rush in and sweep you off your feet. A healthy dose of realism can prevent your day from turning into a major disappointment."
capricorn,2011-09-10,"You may have a friend or lover who is so shy that he or she won't let you know what's going on today. Don't make any assumptions about how much others like you, for you might miscalculate your popularity now. Luckily, romantic Venus in your 7th House of Relationships is setting a sweet and sensual tone for the weekend. Go ahead, make the first move and see what happens."
aquarius,2011-09-10,"You are on edge now as your natural high-frequency energy is impeded by inconvenient feelings that are rising to the surface. Although sidestepping your emotions isn't always a good idea, remaining rational makes more sense today so you can focus on practical issues. Anything that draws your mind to the present moment can also act as a shield against someone else's drama."
pisces,2011-09-10,"Flirty Venus and sexy Mars are quite active today in your 5th House of Romance and your 7th House of Partners, increasing your desire to spend special time with someone you love. However, don't increase the complexity by dreaming and scheming for the future. Instead, live as joyfully as you can in the here and now."
aries,2011-09-11,"Although your life may seem complicated today, it's not necessarily unpleasant. In fact, you're able to see subtleties that were previously invisible, and now you can integrate them into your current thinking. But be careful; your impulsive style tempts you to jump to a conclusion even if your assumptions are faulty. Utilizing common sense when you're making decisions goes a long way in preventing problems later on."
taurus,2011-09-11,"Your vision of the future is not based on a whimsical fantasy; it originates from your pragmatic perspective, combined with your legendary determination. Your dreams can be very rejuvenating, but it's difficult to make plans now because you may set your goals too high. It's not that you're greedy; it's just that everything good appears to be within easy reach. Let your imagination run wild, but reconsider your options next week when your logic returns."
gemini,2011-09-11,"Mischievous Mercury can get you into trouble today, encouraging you to forget your previous plans and spontaneously make new ones. But you cannot just assume that your daydreams will turn into reality, for a sudden turn of events could jolt you awake and make you deal with the facts. Although it might seem like you're being inundated with a hodgepodge of information at first, you may be pleasantly surprised with where it all leads."
cancer,2011-09-11,"You are inclined to listen to your gut instincts today, rather than your logic. A friend or partner might remind you of your previous obligations; others are depending on you, leaving very little room for flights of fancy. Although you won't be able to shut off your overactive imagination, you cannot drift far from reality now without getting pulled back. A little daydreaming is okay as long as you don't let your fantasies distract you from what must be done."
leo,2011-09-11,"You feel very passionate about someone or something today, and your intensity can be overwhelming to those who don't understand you. However, your sense of purpose is stronger than usual now and you do not want to get distracted. Nevertheless, your desires can be stimulated by someone special, which tests your resolve and self-discipline. Just remember that it's healthier to express yourself calmly. If you hide your feelings they will likely erupt later in a more dramatic fashion."
virgo,2011-09-11,"Your ruling planet Mercury sends mixed signals today, telling you to stick to the facts while turning up the volume on your fantasies. You might try to ignore your daydreams, but they keep popping up whether they are invited or not. Stop thinking that you have to pick mundane reality over your creative visions. Instead, enjoy the conversation between these two realms as long as possible. Cultivating your imagination will only enhance your productivity."
libra,2011-09-11,"It's not easy to stay focused on practical matters today, even if you think you have a viable plan. It doesn't really matter that you have made previous commitments; you want to do something more interesting than just fulfilling your obligations. Fortunately, making time for a quick escape or a creative diversion can be revitalizing. Giving yourself permission to have fun will enable you to return to your unfinished chores with new enthusiasm."
scorpio,2011-09-11,"Whether it's romantic or friendly, love is in the air today with the Moon in your playful 5th House and Venus visiting your social 11th House. Although you can overdo the pleasure-seeking side of things now, it won't help to get so caught up in your desires that you can rationalize nearly anything. Incorrect assumptions and faulty logic might backfire. Once all your thinking is done, you still must face the feelings that you tried to avoid in the first place."
sagittarius,2011-09-11,"This may be such a socially active weekend that you don't have enough time to be alone so you can hear your own thoughts. Fortunately, you may enjoy the variety of activities, but your friends and family sometimes might be too much, even for you. Don't be afraid to establish healthy boundaries. Take care of your own needs, too; it's not your job to make everyone happy."
capricorn,2011-09-11,"You may be extra hard on yourself if you don't meet all your responsibilities today. But your mind can wander far and wide now, making it difficult to complete your chores. You may attempt to stop your daydreaming because you believe that it lessens your productivity. Ironically, the opposite is true; your active imagination feeds your creativity, enabling you to accomplish more than you expect."
aquarius,2011-09-11,"Today's innovative thinking can bring unexpected answers to long-standing questions. However, clever Mercury's anxious alignment with erratic Uranus might also lead to trouble if you act on a false assumption or jump to an incorrect conclusion. Even if you want to know the truth now, it may be smarter to trust your intuition instead of only relying on the facts. Nevertheless, it's still wise to wait a day or two before initiating action."
pisces,2011-09-11,"Set aside your regular routine long enough to make time to get in touch with your soul today. Rather than being productive by running errands and doing chores, revel in your creative imagination. Make use of the Moon's return to your dreamy sign by escaping from the everyday world and indulging in your fantasies or spiritual pursuits. You can always take care of unfinished business later in the day."
aries,2011-09-12,"The Pisces Full Moon brightens your 12th House of Divinity, but you aren't ready to go on a vision quest. Instead, fight off your fleeting flights of fancy and head off to your job where you can put your great ideas to practical use. Remember, the more information you can keep track of at work, the better it will be for you now. Fortunately, if you apply yourself diligently, you'll have time for more spiritual pursuits later."
taurus,2011-09-12,"Today's imaginative Pisces Full Moon is in your 11th House of Friends, Hopes and Wishes, luring you into social situations that allow you to feel safe enough to express your private thoughts and tentative plans about your future. Surround yourself with your best friends so you don't have to worry about the practicality of your dreams in order to share them."
gemini,2011-09-12,"Your current obsession with success is reflected in your intense dreams about your career. But it's difficult to be realistic when the otherworldly Pisces Full Moon shines in your professional 10th House. Nevertheless, if you want to make progress today, use your common sense to navigate your course instead of relying on your intuition to find your way."
cancer,2011-09-12,"The watery Pisces Full Moon shimmers in your 9th House of Adventure, luring you to swim beyond your current boundaries. Rather than thinking of reasons why you shouldn't take a risk, make this an exercise in writing your own ticket for a fantastic voyage. Just don't plan too far ahead; even the most amazing journey begins with a few small, careful steps."
leo,2011-09-12,"You might be struggling as you try to figure out the easiest way to attain the level of intimacy you so intensely desire in a relationship now. You're able to feel the energy, but don't necessarily have a workable strategy to put it all together. Skip the details; just get the big picture embedded in your brain today. You can return to your plans later in the week to fill in more specifics."
virgo,2011-09-12,"You may believe your logic is bulletproof and that you can talk your way through nearly any situation. However, if you encounter resistance today, don't let on that you have all the facts because others might not be convinced. They are not interested in your careful analysis at this time; all they want to know is the bottom line."
libra,2011-09-12,"The Sun is hiding in your 12th House of Secrets, so you may want to share a long lost dream with someone special. If you can't recall the details today, try sinking into your subconscious to recover them. Don't expect a treasure map with directions to suddenly appear. The Full Moon is in your 6th House of Work, indicating that you'll need to conduct a methodical search to find your truth."
scorpio,2011-09-12,"You won't need to go out of your way to make plans to have a good time as today's imaginative Pisces Full Moon illuminates your 5th House of Fun and Games. Your positive attitude is so strong that you believe extra preparation won't be necessary. Fortunately, this assumption works in your favor; you can make it up as you go. Just remember to watch the time or you could miss an important appointment later in the day."
sagittarius,2011-09-12,"You may receive some notoriety today with the hardworking Virgo Sun shining in your 10th House of Public Recognition. But the Full Moon is in your 4th House of Home and Family, so you might try to avoid the spotlight now. Unfortunately, you could regret your actions if you sidestep any well-deserved acknowledgment, so do whatever is necessary to overcome your uncharacteristic shyness so you can put on a show that others won't forget."
capricorn,2011-09-12,"You are very methodical as you develop a strategy for the months ahead. But the confusing Pisces Full Moon is in your noisy 3rd House of Immediate Environment, so you might not be effective today when attempting to put your plans into motion. Don't promise more than you can deliver now, for whatever schedule you commit to will likely need modifying in a day or two when things quiet down."
aquarius,2011-09-12,"You may not be very careful with your money today, for the fuzzy Pisces Full Moon Pisces reflects the sunlight in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. You could be sloppy with your calculations or you might even start off with a wrong assumption. Naturally, it's not wise to procrastinate if your finances need immediate attention. Focus on the necessary details and postpone the rest."
pisces,2011-09-12,"Today's Full Moon falls in your compassionate sign, challenging you to be extremely clear as you establish necessary boundaries and limits. You might feel driven to rescue every wounded animal, plant or person you encounter now, yet this could derail your personal plans. Wanting to help anyone less fortunate than you is surely an admirable trait as long as you don't take it too far."
aries,2011-09-13,"Your emotions are running amok now that the Moon is hooking up with crazy Uranus in your sign. You want to experience the extreme intensity while somehow simultaneously acting cool. However, you can't play it both ways, even if it seems like you must give up something when you choose one or the other. Logic only takes you so far today, but going beyond words and trusting your instincts could put you back on track."
taurus,2011-09-13,"You truly want a romantic relationship to work out today, even if you have to face an old issue that you prefer to avoid. You realize that you can't hide your head in the sand any longer, even if you thought that you would be able to take the easy way out. Fortunately, handling your fears won't be as tough as you thought. It's much more difficult to pretend that everything is fine when it's not."
gemini,2011-09-13,"You can sense a powerful shift in the cosmic weather today as the clouds of illusion are chased from your inner skies. You are ready to get to the bottom of something that has bothered you lately, but the answers you receive won't likely be the ones you expect. Don't be shocked by what you discover now. Even though persistence doesn't come easily to you, it will pay off."
cancer,2011-09-13,"Something is motivating you to share more than you expected today, even if you know that you should say less. Unfortunately, once you open your mouth, closing it becomes much more difficult. It's helpful to remind yourself throughout the day that you don't have to tell your whole story all at once. Reacting slowly and deliberately will get you further than speaking too soon."
leo,2011-09-13,"It's time to move past old hurtful memories so you can be open to the joy that's recently found its way into your life. However, this doesn't mean that you should just forget about your previous experiences. Setting aside your feelings is not a sensible strategy because you'll only end up being irritated without an obvious reason. Ultimately, your willingness to be open-minded can lead to an exciting emotional breakthrough that can shake up your outlook on life and send you off in a new direction."
virgo,2011-09-13,"You might be trying to deepen a business or personal relationship now, but could run into a totally unexpected response from the other person. Even if you are open to surprises, it's challenging when things don't fit into a neat and tidy package. Fortunately, this won't become a problem unless you make it one. You're at the start of something new, so allow the energy to flow naturally rather than frustrating yourself by wishing the tides would follow your schedule."
libra,2011-09-13,"The Moon's shift into your 7th House of Partnerships increases the stress in relationships, especially if other people seem overly pushy today. You may be tempted to withdraw to protect yourself emotionally, but this strategy only increases your sense of isolation. Instead of shutting out others now, try to understand their point of view. Once you can see things through someone else's eyes, you can establish common ground, enabling everyone to feel better about the situation."
scorpio,2011-09-13,"The feisty Aries Moon dynamically squares your key planet Pluto today, stirring up raw emotions that can suddenly erupt. But you don't want to escalate a conflict now; you simply prefer to get to the source of your anger so you can process your feelings and move on. Fortunately, you are motivated to do so once you realize that holding on to the past will only bring you unhappiness, even if there's a bright future beckoning just ahead."
sagittarius,2011-09-13,"You are already anticipating good things just around the bend, but the future cannot arrive soon enough for you. You have plenty of responsibilities to fulfill today before you can head out to play, but you're ready to leave them until later if something interesting comes up. Fortunately, you should be able to grab the fun and excitement in the present moment as long as you remember to finish your chores once you return."
capricorn,2011-09-13,"You may not be ready for the speed of change now as the Moon meets up with unpredictable Uranus. You have a choice to make that can affect your whole day. Either let the pressure get the best of you by fearfully worrying about something you can't control or consciously turn your frown into a grin, knowing that change is on the way whether you want it or not. Don't expect a miracle, but remember that your positive attitude and flexibility can turn a tough day into a positive one."
aquarius,2011-09-13,"Although you may think that you have everything under control, something happens today that forces you to see the world differently. Instead of trying to keep up with your busy schedule, it may be more sensible to let it fall apart and then piece things back together once the chaos clears. It's too late for preventive medicine now; just be ready for change and let the chips fall where they may."
pisces,2011-09-13,You may feel as if you're being pushed into the future against your will. It's not that you're resistant to progress; it's just that you have grown comfortable with the status quo and you're not yet ready for it to slip into the past. Keep in mind that your fear of what's coming next may be more problematic than the actual challenges you will face. Don't worry about the unknown; there's nothing you can do about the future until it arrives.
aries,2011-09-14,"You may feel moody now that the Moon is back in your sign, but you're still able to accomplish a lot as long as you don't let your emotional melodramas get in the way. It's easy to become so enthusiastic that you quickly lose your sense of proportion. However, just taking time for a few deep breaths may give you enough of a break to remind you to be practical, even when you're under the influence of an adrenaline rush."
taurus,2011-09-14,"You may experience relief today, especially if you're able to process negativity that has been lurking just out of sight. Still, you're concerned if you cannot get all your feelings out into the open right away. However, your imagination can trick you into worrying about the wrong things now. Don't waste energy obsessing about what you should say; instead, graciously accept that everything will surface at the right time. Fortunately, you have more time than you think."
gemini,2011-09-14,"Your excitement is contagious today as your key planet Mercury harmonizes with expansive Jupiter; but all the enthusiasm in the world won't help you get the job done unless you actually follow through with the required effort. An idea might sound so wonderful now that you react impulsively, only to be surprised when you run into obstacles that could have been avoided with forethought. Your work will have more impact if you slow down and take your time."
cancer,2011-09-14,"You might freak out today because others expect you to jump in and assume control of a situation in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable. However, there may be too much at stake for you to resist, so fire up your self-confidence and just take charge. Even if you're unsure of yourself, the timing is right and you will likely come through with flying colors if you're willing to take a chance and believe in yourself."
leo,2011-09-14,"It appears as if nothing will stop you today, but you may need a reality check if you don't maintain a healthy sense of proportion. Your tendency is to blast ahead now with innocent confidence, yet your blind optimism can lead to trouble. It's better to see the roadblock (or the cliff) before it's too late to do something about it. Preventive action is always better than crisis management."
virgo,2011-09-14,You are super-confident today as rational Mercury creates a fluid trine with buoyant Jupiter. You may believe that nearly anything you set your mind to is within reach. But caution is advised because you can miss a critical piece of information if you already believe you know the facts. Positive thinking can be a major asset now as long as you balance it with a healthy dose of reality.
libra,2011-09-14,"It seems to be your job to make nice, especially if a friend or partner is upset or angry with someone else. Fortunately, you're skilled at helping others move past their personal issues so they can establish common ground, rather than intensifying apparent differences. Although the wisest strategy may not be obvious at first, Venus shifts into your charming sign today, enabling you to put everyone involved at ease."
scorpio,2011-09-14,"A change in your daily routine sounds exciting today and you're eager to shake things up just to create a little drama. However, you might underestimate the impact of your actions on others now as trickster Mercury and jovial Jupiter spread their optimism. Be careful; your current buoyancy won't be enough to smooth over someone's hurt feelings if you aren't tactful in your approach. Find a creative outlet for your restless energy, instead."
sagittarius,2011-09-14,"You are probably feeling pretty good about your job today as a confident Mercury-Jupiter trine activates your career houses. But your impetuous style might backfire if you move too quickly. Your reality filter isn't working very efficiently now, causing you to see what you want instead of the truth. Getting carried away by the exhilaration of the present moment can be quite uplifting if you remember to keep one foot solidly planted on the ground."
capricorn,2011-09-14,"You could be pulled off course today by an urgent need to focus on your home and family. Perhaps starting a constructive conversation is all that's needed. Although you might insist that you're ready to make a long-term commitment, you aren't as certain as you sound. Don't take on any additional obligations until you find a healthy balance between your desires for immediate gratification and your ambitious future goals."
aquarius,2011-09-14,"Although you might think you have already reached your limit, the pace of events picks up another notch today. You can jump from one task to another, leaving a trail of loose ends behind you. Rather than setting unattainable goals, give yourself permission to take as much time as you need. You may be pleasantly surprised with how much you can accomplish once you slow down and center yourself."
pisces,2011-09-14,"Think again before you make any impulsive purchases today because you could act irresponsibly with your money. The temptation to buy something foolish can create problems, even if you don't see the truth of the situation yet. Just remember that your thinking isn't very clear now, so wait a few days before needlessly jeopardizing your financial position."
aries,2011-09-15,"You might be worried that you have too much going on today, but you should be able to complete most of your tasks as long as you remember to remain focused. Fortunately, you can turn a tricky set of circumstances into a manageable situation, but there isn't much margin for error. Even if you cannot finish everything, give yourself permission to feel good about your efforts."
taurus,2011-09-15,"The bumps in the road could smooth out today when the Moon returns to your determined sign. Although you apply yourself diligently toward your responsibilities, meeting your obligations isn't enough to bring satisfaction; you also want to enjoy yourself in the process. Ironically, finishing your work can leave you feeling frustrated, unless you have a partner to share in your success. Spice up your day by asking someone to join you for a bit of fun."
gemini,2011-09-15,You may feel irritated by the restrictions being placed on you today. You might need to cut your extracurricular activities short so you can take care of a chore at home or respond to a family matter. Don't fret over a missed social opportunity because it's healthier to simply let it go. You will feel better now if you just focus on doing your job well and helping out any way you can.
cancer,2011-09-15,"Your life seems uncomplicated when you just do what you're supposed to do. But even if you know what you should be working on, you may lack the inspiration that's required to conjure up the correct magical words or actions. Even if you aren't very excited about what's ahead, keep plodding through the day. Luckily, your enthusiasm will gather momentum, giving you the ability to affect others in a positive manner."
leo,2011-09-15,"You're progressing toward your destination and, fortunately, your recent efforts finally begin to show progress. However, you may not have a lot of time to celebrate because there's so much to do in order to fulfill your professional commitments. Although a sudden attraction could catch you off guard, it's best to maintain a healthy perspective and refrain from impulsive or obsessive behavior. Honor your feelings, but don't lose sight of those things that are important to your work."
virgo,2011-09-15,"The Moon's shift into stable Taurus indicates that you must pay attention to the practical side of life. You may not want to stop what you're doing just to engage in essential activities such as drinking and eating, but running off to participate in a wildly impractical adventure can be dangerous now. Don't wait until your health is compromised before you start taking care of yourself."
libra,2011-09-15,"You have a gnawing sensation that your social conditions are becoming too complicated to manage now. It feels as if something is going to change, but you cannot tell what it may be yet. You might even feel on edge as you run through all the possibilities. Unfortunately, your heightened sense of anticipation of the unknown could be happening a few weeks too soon. Instead of worrying about what's ahead, finish up anything you've already started and give yourself a chance to relax."
scorpio,2011-09-15,"Your social life may be very active these days, but it's important to be discriminating about what you do so you aren't lured away from your responsibilities. It's wise to be practical, even if your fantasies are another source of distraction now that Venus is visiting your 12th House of Dreams. But don't just spend your time making plans. A methodical approach and consistent effort may not produce immediate results, but you'll gain significant momentum over the days ahead."
sagittarius,2011-09-15,"You may rebel if you are expected to manage a whole lot of details today because being serious is not your idea of fun and games. Still, you're bound to feel much better if you can tie up as many loose ends as possible. Just don't take any shortcuts because questionable motives will invite the energy to unravel what you already completed. It's more important now to follow through on a project already in motion than to go off on a new venture."
capricorn,2011-09-15,"The Moon's shift into fellow Earth sign Taurus this evening reflects your need to slow down and get things right the first time. You can always make plans for your next great adventure tomorrow. Still, this isn't a particularly easy day, but you can be very productive if you're willing to balance your down-to-earth approach with your ambitious goals."
aquarius,2011-09-15,"You may be feeling extra clever now and are motivated to move quickly on your plans for the immediate future. But, too much spontaneity can spell trouble, so look carefully at what you are going to do prior to initiating action. Be smart and reconsider your options, while you still have time. Postpone the actual start date until next week for the best results."
pisces,2011-09-15,"The picky Virgo Sun is camping out in your 7th House of Partnerships now, suggesting that you must deal with more interpersonal drama than you prefer. But the Moon in your 3rd House of Communication starts a conversation with a practical person, revealing the weak links in your pet project. Don't shut out your friends who disagree with your opinions. Opening your mind increases your chances of cultivating successful relationships."
aries,2011-09-16,"You are so enthusiastic about all the possibilities today that it's difficult to settle down. You might not notice the tension that's building because a Mars-Neptune alignment is preventing you from seeing how the current circumstances will unfold. Nevertheless, the earthy Taurus Moon helps to filter out some of the unreliable information now, so it's still safe to trust your senses in the immediate moment without trying to figure out what may happen next."
taurus,2011-09-16,"The Moon's visit to your bucolic sign normally helps you find the solace you seek. However, you may grow bored today and start thinking about different ways to add excitement into your life. But be careful, for once you open the floodgates, you might wish for the calmer times you left behind. Instead of destabilizing your life, just change your attitude. You don't have to turn everything upside down to make your day a success."
gemini,2011-09-16,"You may be craving a little action and are eager to party even before you complete your work. However, you cannot just go off and play. If you're frustrated, your annoyance might grow into resentment and stand in the way of your fun later on. Stop wasting your time; meet your obligations expediently, so you can have yourself a great time once everything's done."
cancer,2011-09-16,"You probably realize how amazing your friends are now, especially those who stand up to defend you or rush to your side when you need their help. Ironically, they may not think that their behavior is out of the ordinary -- and that's what makes it so special. There's no reason to turn your appreciation into too big of a deal today as long as you make certain that those you cherish know how much you appreciate them."
leo,2011-09-16,"You know exactly what you should be doing today, but your heart isn't into it. You are bored with someone else's agenda and don't want to chase a pot of gold that isn't at the end of your own rainbow. It's healthy to focus on your personal goals now rather than anyone else's. Just be sure that your heightened practicality doesn't stand between you and an otherwise delightful time."
virgo,2011-09-16,"You might have an exciting vision about your future today without necessarily being too impractical about it. Although you can imagine an extraordinary outcome to your current situation, it's not beyond your reach. Just be careful about stepping over the fine line between possibilities and fantasies. Believing in the impossible will help you stretch beyond your normal limits, but reaching your destination will still take advanced planning and hard work."
libra,2011-09-16,"You're tired of being patient because you know exactly what you want and see no logical reason to wait any longer before initiating action. Your sense of urgency may be fueled by someone who seems to be even more impulsive than you are today. Still, there's something that's holding you back. Don't overanalyze your feelings. Just listen to your intuition; if you think that postponing your move makes sense, then that is exactly what you should do."
scorpio,2011-09-16,"Someone may be enticing you to take a risk, but you're not quite ready to jump. Still, the support you receive feels good and it does make you consider reaching for the stars. You are tempted to reveal your current negativity, yet doing so could jeopardize what you have already created. Of course you are free to respond however you see fit, but minimizing your concerns could ameliorate the tension, at least for now."
sagittarius,2011-09-16,"It's tempting to lower your expectations now so your co-workers don't disappoint you with their lack of reliability. But you won't likely reach your goals if you let someone off the hook too easily, so adopting a relaxed approach isn't a smart tactic for long. Keep your aim high, remind others of their commitments and you won't fall short of your target."
capricorn,2011-09-16,"You may be a bit scattered at work today because you're thinking of everything else you would rather be doing. But if your current activities aren't bringing you pleasure, your thoughts could fly all over the place as you attempt to find your groove. Instead of trying to make progress on every front, just pick one and focus all of your attention on it. Limit your options now so you can expand your future possibilities later."
aquarius,2011-09-16,"You wish you could be irresponsible today and avoid following through on your previous promises. You might make a judgment error that leads you to think that you're more effective motivating others now rather than just meeting your obligations. In truth, the best leadership skill you could apply now is setting an example for everyone to follow. Don't talk about what needs to happen; just do it."
pisces,2011-09-16,"You don't want to admit that you're feeling hopelessly optimistic today because you think it will reveal too much vulnerability on your part. However, you probably do believe that better times are just around the next corner. Meanwhile, your personal life may suffer because you are focusing on the future instead of dealing with an issue in the present. Bringing your attention back to the here and now might be challenging at first, but will make you happier in the long run."
aries,2011-09-17,"You know what you agreed to do today, but you have a twinkle in your eye and may not be able to resist creating a bit of mischief, instead. You're eager to take a risk and break out of your regular routine, even if you know it's not the smartest course of action. Although your judgment isn't very clear now, you still might try to justify your behavior. Ask someone you trust for another perspective before doing something you regret."
taurus,2011-09-17,"Your ruling planet Venus opposes electric Uranus today, wiring you for pleasure. But your intense desires can create an emotional short circuit when you realize that satisfaction is just out of reach. Your daydreams may be unrealistic, but it really doesn't matter if you make your fantasy real or not. What's important now is to give yourself permission to imagine what would bring you happiness if anything was possible."
gemini,2011-09-17,"You might try to float through the day on a cloud of illusions, but an unexpected turn of events can shock you out of your dream state. Even if you're able to field a curve ball at work or at home, you still might miss the significance of what is happening. Although you may be surprised by what happens, take the time to contemplate what the cosmos is attempting to tell you."
cancer,2011-09-17,"Although someone's reaction to your request may not be what you expect, you should be able to take it in stride. You might be concerned at first because you don't particularly like confronting the unknown, but even if you're caught off guard today, you're relieved to know the truth. Don't let subconscious motivations trick you into pushing away the new information; integrate what you learn and change your plans before moving on."
leo,2011-09-17,"You might be very excited about someone or something new in your life now, but you have a sneaking suspicion that your high level of interest won't last. You may be cautious about letting go and enjoying yourself because it's obvious that your sense of freedom will quickly run into limiting circumstances. Change is inevitable, but worrying about future responsibilities doesn't need to interfere with today's pleasures."
virgo,2011-09-17,"You may be put off by someone's selfish behavior today and you could even be offended by other people's lack of compassion. Unfortunately, you won't likely be able to understand their actions because logic is not the motivating factor now. Unexplainable changes are to be expected if tension is stressing a relationship. Don't overanalyze things; just respond with kindness and honesty. The storm will pass quickly if you remain flexible in your thinking."
libra,2011-09-17,"Your key planet Venus is visiting your 1st House of Self and her opposition to radical Uranus in your 7th House of Relationships can awaken previously hidden desires or uncover something about your partner that you didn't know. Instead of waiting for a friend to shock you with an unexpected revelation, take the initiative and be an agent of change. You will be happier now if you embrace the shift instead of resisting it."
scorpio,2011-09-17,"You might wish that you could release your old expectations and express your feelings today as unconventional Uranus in your 5th House of Romance opposes loving Venus. But you may not know what you want; your emotions are slippery now, making it tough to choose a direct course of action. Nevertheless, you have a perfect opportunity to learn something important about yourself if you're willing to relinquish control and go with the flow."
sagittarius,2011-09-17,"Although you wish a friend or partner would make a straightforward decision today, clarity may continue to be elusive. You won't likely receive a yes or no answer now, requiring you to be satisfied with someone's uncertainty. Don't push for resolution because it may take time for the facts to emerge. It's possible that other people's ambivalence might be a reflection of your own, even though you believe that you have already made your choice."
capricorn,2011-09-17,"You could mistakenly believe that the solution to your current dilemma is in having all the facts, prompting you to gather as much useful information as you can. Unfortunately, you are not very cautious now, so you could jump to an incorrect conclusion that's based on your desires instead of what is practical. Be smart and postpone any major decision until your energy settles down; your path should begin to clear in a few days."
aquarius,2011-09-17,"Your desire for an emotional connection pulls you one way while your need for independence pulls another as your key planet Uranus stands off in a tense tug-of-war with sensual Venus. You may wish for more intimacy in your everyday life, but might keep others at a distance if you're afraid of losing autonomy. Fortunately, a sudden breakthrough in your awareness can open your heart and change the dynamics of a relationship. Set aside practicalities and be flexible enough to respond to the magic of the moment."
pisces,2011-09-17,You may be weary of the tension you feel in a close relationship if your perspective is challenged again today. You don't like the idea of arguing with your partner; nor do you want to waste energy justifying your desires. Your needs are simple; you just want your heartfelt expression to be heard and acknowledged. This isn't a time for ultimatums; just let others know what you need in a gentle manner and remain patient while waiting to see the results. The dynamics are shifting quickly and you just may receive what you want.
aries,2011-09-18,"You aren't one to be threatened or pushed around, yet you might respond too strongly today when dealing with someone who seems to be on your case. Unfortunately, you probably don't even realize how overbearing you can sound. Your smartest strategy is to downplay any emotions that may surface now so you don't scare others away. Be gentle in your approach no matter how intense your feelings are in the moment."
taurus,2011-09-18,"Your ruling planet Venus dynamically squares relentless Pluto today, possibly creating discord in love or an argument over the control of finances. However, there may be more going on than is apparent and the real reason for conflict isn't necessarily the obvious one. The current situation may actually be the designated playing field for a deeper issue. Keep in mind that there's no reason to avoid what you don't understand."
gemini,2011-09-18,"You know that sharing your uncomfortable feelings can act as a catalyst that transforms them into healthier expressions of your needs. But talking about psychological issues isn't that simple, especially if you say one thing yet mean something else. You may think that you are being very clear, yet others may not understand what you're trying to explain today. Nevertheless, taking the time now to connect with your friends in a deeper way enriches your relationships and brings you comfort."
cancer,2011-09-18,"You can see how someone special is engaging you in an intense process now that has the potential to transform who you really are. Your initial reaction could be to run, but a magnetic attraction keeps you connected, even if you think it's not such a good idea. Although you attempt to set clear boundaries to protect yourself from losing control, you might be unhappily surprised to discover that you're in deeper than you thought. Don't withdraw; ultimately, the change will do you good."
leo,2011-09-18,"You may realize that you're in over your head as the fervent Venus-Pluto square raises the heat on a romance. You're not feeling as casual as you expected; something is changing and you're more inclined to play to win. Paradoxically, you may be simultaneously pulled toward a more metaphysical orientation to love. Don't lose your perspective; be smart and maintain a healthy balance between a physical and spiritual approach to relationships."
virgo,2011-09-18,"Your strong feelings today bring up serious issues around your basic values. Differences seem insurmountable if you and your partner have divergent views. Attempts to convince the other person of his or her guilt are fruitless. Instead of pointing blame at anyone else, try a more cooperative approach now. Follow your dreams as they guide you along, while encouraging others to do the same."
libra,2011-09-18,"There might be hidden truths that need to be spoken today. Or, maybe, someone is attempting to keep his or her true feelings secret behind a protective wall. Being intelligent and removing yourself from danger is always wise, but this situation is less about being safe than it is about fearful isolation. Fortunately, resourceful Venus is in your corner now, enabling you to calm down and figure out what makes the most sense. Your natural inclination to create harmony will set the right tone for an honest conversation."
scorpio,2011-09-18,"You intend to honor your integrity as you strive to connect to a deeper set of emotions that were recently stirred. However, you are intelligent enough to realize that sharing your true feelings now is probably counterproductive. Sweet Venus squares domineering Pluto, indicating stress that arises from not knowing how much you should reveal. There's no hurry; wait a few more days before climbing too far out on a limb."
sagittarius,2011-09-18,"You want to focus your attention on the intriguing adventures down the road, but you must first handle difficult feelings in the present moment. You might try to avoid directing your negativity at a loved one, or, maybe jealousy has sneaked in past your defenses and is now fueling a feud. You would prefer to take the high road, but denial won't solve the underlying problems. Your friends might have good advice, but you will have to ask for their help before they're willing to step in and give it."
capricorn,2011-09-18,"You would like to be practical, yet circumstances can pull you into a heavy emotional stew today where nothing is clear. You could be annoyed with someone who pushes your buttons, but then won't follow through with a constructive discussion. Even if you're willing to talk about love, the key players may be at cross-purposes with one another. Don't be overly concerned because the energies will shift significantly over the days ahead."
aquarius,2011-09-18,"Everyone is taking you more seriously these days, yet you're afraid this phase won't last too much longer. Somehow you still can find the time to create an emotional drama with an intimate partner, especially if he or she thinks that your long-term plans are illogical. Be careful, because you could become obsessed with a current idea, even if it ultimately makes little sense. Listen to the advice you receive with a flexible mind and an open heart."
pisces,2011-09-18,"Your attraction to a loved one is complicated today by unexpressed negativity or by your belief that others are attempting to coerce you into agreeing with them. Fortunately, you are way too clever to be dominated by someone's show of force now and you can quickly escape from the clutches of insecure emotions. Stay diligent; it will take a few more days until you're able to put some time between you and your past."
aries,2011-09-19,"You are very excited, but you can't necessarily put your finger on the reason for your current good mood. You might even feel okay in the face of something unpleasant that you learn today. Someone may place an obstacle on your path to happiness, but you probably won't even mind because you're able to dance your way around nearly anything that stands in your way now. Still, it's wise to allow plenty of time to finish your work because everything could take longer than you think."
taurus,2011-09-19,"It's difficult to make a significant decision today since it feels like you're being pulled in several different directions. Usually you're able to process complex issues and condense the information into one simple conclusion, but no single solution seems correct now. Don't force an answer; it will come naturally on its own."
gemini,2011-09-19,"You aren't very sure of yourself today as the Moon in your adaptable sign squares mental Mercury. You may become self-critical if you're having trouble dealing with the more practical side of life. Fortunately, you know that you'll figure things out, but it could take another day or two. If you can't put the big picture together yet, just concentrate on the little pieces of the puzzle until everything fits into place."
cancer,2011-09-19,"You're ready for a change, but oddly enough, you don't necessarily know what you want. You may try to overcompensate for your fear of the unknown by acting with false bravado. However, faking your enthusiasm will only complicate the situation even further, so just be as honest as you can by telling others what you are truly feeling."
leo,2011-09-19,"You may be very entertaining today, but putting on a show won't likely bring you the happiness you seek. Instead of pretending that you have it all together, preparing for a later performance can make a big difference. However, it's important to strike a balance between following the script and being flexible enough to improvise in the present moment. Aside from practicing your lines, listen to those around you and respond from your heart."
virgo,2011-09-19,"You may not want to retreat from a position you recently took, but you might realize today that you were too eager or overly confident. Finally, reality is starting to set in and you might see the consequences of your undelivered promises and unfinished work. But don't waste any energy being mad at yourself. The best thing to do is apologize if necessary and then move on."
libra,2011-09-19,"You may not actually hear voices today, but you're likely aware of the guidance you're receiving from aliens, angels or your subconscious mind. One thing is for certain: this isn't business as usual. Something strange and wonderful is occurring now, so don't push it away. Pay attention to the symbols that appear in your fantasies and dreams because they could contain the message you have been seeking all along."
scorpio,2011-09-19,"You are usually attracted to the mysteries of life, yet now you prefer straightforward answers to more practical concerns. Sadly, there isn't an easy way out today so it's better to seek satisfaction by contemplating the meaning of life, rather than wasting time chasing your tail. Just keep in mind that letting go is not the same thing as giving up."
sagittarius,2011-09-19,"You're still a bit too serious today because you don't want to scale back your plans just to make them more realistic. Even if you're being tested by current circumstances, there's no good reason to lose confidence. You can realize your dreams, but it helps to compromise. If you acknowledge the things that are not negotiable, you may be surprised at how fast you progress to establishing common ground."
capricorn,2011-09-19,"The intensity level of your emotions is on the rise today, and you're not sure how to handle your feelings. It may seem like everything is out of control, magnifying your uneasiness with the suppressed and irrational side of your nature. Unfortunately, you cannot stuff your fears back into the box. Don't sink into denial; instead, muster up enough courage to face the unknown."
aquarius,2011-09-19,"You may be anticipating an easygoing day, but the Moon's visit to your 5th House of Fun and Games makes things difficult because you are required to play by someone else's specific instructions. Unfortunately, others are changing the rules as fast as you create them now. Ironically, you can shift the dynamics and place yourself in a winning position by acquiescing today. Letting another person take charge may not be your usual style, but it could be the best strategy at this time."
pisces,2011-09-19,"You truly believe that you have your life back under control today, but someone may still appear to challenge the basis of your authority. You are comfortable with running the show when your leadership is needed, but you're not interested in fighting to get the position. Luckily, there are many exciting possibilities ahead and keeping your options open is wiser than making a wrong decision under haste."
aries,2011-09-20,"You may be fast-talking early in the day, but you could grow tired of listening to the sound of your own voice. Once the Moon slips into emotional Cancer, you might think that it's wiser to say nothing at all. However, withholding your desires can be as problematic as sharing too much information. Fortunately, you don't need to encourage a melodrama that evolves from an all-or-nothing strategy. Walk away from the internal tug-of-war and just appreciate every moment for what it is."
taurus,2011-09-20,"Financial pressures may turn a wonderful day into one filled with angst. It helps to remember that there are some things that are simply out of your control today, including how much money you have on hand. Still, you're responsible for specific behaviors that can immediately impact the current situation. For example, spending less can truly work in your favor now. A conservative approach ensures that you'll have what you need tomorrow."
gemini,2011-09-20,"You might not be very cooperative today, even if you care deeply for your friends and associates. You want others to be successful at whatever they choose to do, but you prefer to keep the energy low-key and not share your feelings. Although conserving your energy is a smart strategy now, it won't hurt to just nod your head in approval so others, at least, know that you heard what was said. The best plan might be to take a bit of time to be alone so you can sort out your thoughts."
cancer,2011-09-20,"The Moon's return to your contemplative sign this afternoon may raise issues of doubt about your chosen path. You have a way with words now and might choose to hide your uncertainties behind a mask of humor. Unfortunately, your desire to acquire something beautiful could create its own complicated story. Postpone a non-essential purchase and focus on building trust, instead."
leo,2011-09-20,"Attending to financial issues can take precedence today over encouraging the whimsical dreams of others. As much as you might want to help a friend turn a fantasy into reality, don't let your concentration on the material world lapse. You may need to set aside some of your big-hearted generosity in order to get serious about money. Take care of business first so you can offer your support later."
virgo,2011-09-20,"You know what must be done today, but might be paralyzed with fear of doing something wrong. You probably have taken on a lot of responsibility at work, but when you return home later, you'll still need to handle unfinished domestic chores. Don't let all your running around during the day distract you from the important personal work that still needs to be addressed. Your desire for perfection doesn't need to get in your way."
libra,2011-09-20,"Your romantic dreams motivate you to take action, so you don't end up stuck in a world of illusions without achieving success. But accomplishing your goals may not bring you the recognition you want or the love you seek. Being caught up in an exciting flurry of emotions is invigorating, yet it's still crucial to refocus on your core beliefs before taking care of business."
scorpio,2011-09-20,"Your issues about your family of origin are more pressing today, possibly bringing a tough situation to a head. Although you might prefer to sidestep a direct confrontation and move on, you can feel your emotions gaining in strength and you know something will have to give way. Naturally, it's healthier to express your concerns before they become serious problems. Resolve your differences quickly and aim to handle potential conflict before it reaches a critical state."
sagittarius,2011-09-20,"You may have a variety of things to do today, yet it's significant that you keep up the appearance of being a strong leader at work and at home. However, you might not know the exact recipe to make this happen. Forget about the how-to book filled with step-by-step instructions. Instead, reclaim your power by trusting your instincts."
capricorn,2011-09-20,"Your current dilemma pits your need for independence against your desire for relationship security. Unfortunately, there aren't any quick fixes to your deep cravings for a meaningful and spiritual connection. You may long to rediscover a missing sense of purpose that you set aside to climb a corporate or social ladder. Instead of expecting everything to make sense today, simply focus on the most immediate tasks and leave the bigger issues for another day."
aquarius,2011-09-20,"You have been moving quickly to keep up with all the social activities in your life. Now, however, it's time to slow down and reconnect with the more mundane aspects of your existence, such as work. But don't bother making big plans or looking too far ahead, or you'll just end up in a state of confusion. Save the dreaming for another day while you focus on the current daily grind."
pisces,2011-09-20,"Someone may not approve of what you are doing, but you aren't sure why. The more you investigate, the more convoluted the whole situation becomes. You may be ready to give up and simply let the winds of change carry you wherever they will. Unfortunately, your current obligations prevent you from escaping today because other people are counting on you and you can't just run out on them."
aries,2011-09-21,"If you've been withholding your feelings, it's time to release them now that feisty Mars aspects wounded Chiron. Unfortunately, there may be a price to pay because you know more than you are willing to admit. Unexpressed emotions can stew until you lose your temper, so don't keep secrets any longer than necessary. Forgiving yourself is just as important as forgiving others."
taurus,2011-09-21,"Although you may not enjoy being mad at others, you could feel on-edge today and some unsuspecting little thing might be enough to set you off. Naturally, your frustration can prompt angry words, but don't let your thoughts slip out unconsciously. Pay attention and stop yourself from stirring  up trouble. Be honest, but remember that blaming anyone else is entirely unnecessary and counterproductive."
gemini,2011-09-21,"You may have to handle an urgent financial situation that you let go for too long. It could be as simple as processing a bank transaction or paying a bill. But it might require you to set aside time today to get ready for something later in the week. Luckily, your natural flexibility enables you to move through this minor crisis with ease."
cancer,2011-09-21,"Although you don't want to place your feelings out in the open for everyone to see, you're determined to take more of a risk now as headstrong Mars in your 2nd House of Core Beliefs aspects healing Chiron. Meanwhile, the Moon is back in your sign, empowering you to demonstrate your emotional intelligence; forfeit your personal agenda today so you can go along with the general consensus of the group."
leo,2011-09-21,"Someone may be waiting for your support, but you could be annoyed that he or she isn't forthright enough to just come out and ask for help. Remember, others might not be as willing to share their feelings as you are, yet there's nothing to be gained by comparing yourself to your friends. It's healthier to express any anger you are feeling as gently as possible, before it builds into something more complicated and becomes harder to manage."
virgo,2011-09-21,"Your friends may come riding to the rescue now that the nurturing Cancer Moon is in your 11th House of Social Networking. Don't be surprised if others defend your ideas or stand up for your integrity. You might think that everything is being blown out of proportion today, but it's still healthy to protect yourself against someone's attack. Don't hesitate to demonstrate that you're capable of owning your ideas and maintaining an unpopular position."
libra,2011-09-21,"You won't likely feel indecisive today, for there's very little uncertainty in your thoughts and actions. You know exactly how you're feeling now, but don't necessarily want to share your emotions with anyone else, even if others are trying to coerce you into spilling the beans. Although you might prefer to be diplomatic, do whatever you must to set clear boundaries so you can maintain your sense of security."
scorpio,2011-09-21,"Someone may think you're being too intense today when you share your personal vision of the future. But the Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas squares radical Uranus, leaving you torn between following the rules and doing something totally off the wall. Although you're probably leaning toward the expressive, rather than the suppressive, side of the equation, it's still wise to withdraw for a while to give everyone some breathing room."
sagittarius,2011-09-21,"It may come as a shock to a close friend or lover that you want to dig into the emotional underpinnings of your relationship today. Although this may be out of your normal comfort zone, you realize that understanding the current power dynamics is important now. You intuitively know that two opposing factions can be brought back together again through dialogue. Remember, temporarily loosening the reins of control could ultimately shift the advantage in your favor."
capricorn,2011-09-21,"You're not in the mood to listen to others whine about circumstances that are not within their individual control. The responsive Cancer Moon's current visit to your 7th of Relationships encourages you to instruct people to accept their fate and then put their efforts toward something that truly matters. Unfortunately, some folks just don't get the message and others don't even seem to care. The truth is that once you have given your opinion, it's up to everyone else to change their attitudes."
aquarius,2011-09-21,"Following your intuition is your secret strategy today and it can transform you from an ordinary human being into a veritable superhero. Fortunately, you have the stamina now to make your dreams come true, so don't give up. There's no value in justifying your choices to everyone else. All the right words can only do so much; lead by example, instead."
pisces,2011-09-21,"Relationships seem complicated by issues you cannot quite grasp as you try to untangle your feelings from the pile. You may believe that you should be setting new boundaries, but you really don't want to distance yourself from the value of working closely with others at this time. Although you might not feel like being very expressive today, don't be afraid of telling others what's on your mind. You might be pleasantly surprised by what happens next."
aries,2011-09-22,"You may be indecisive today as you wonder how much to reveal and how much to keep to yourself. Although you can justify concentrating on your work and staying away from any complicated emotional entanglements, you might not be able to avoid getting hooked if you see positive potential in a challenging situation. Don't judge yourself harshly if you slip because of a moment of unrealistic optimism."
taurus,2011-09-22,"You prefer to sail on smooth waters, yet you could stir up a few waves today if your emotions clash with someone else's. But don't make a big deal out of a non-issue; there is a fine line between maintaining your integrity and just being plain stubborn. It's fine to hold on to your point of view, but you don't have to try to convince everyone that your perspective is the only right one."
gemini,2011-09-22,"A minor crisis can lead you to learn an important lesson today as the information you receive conflicts with what you already know. Although you like to keep an open mind, you may be forced to take a stand now as your key planet Mercury aligns with opinionated Jupiter. Even if your options are less than perfect, try to be realistic when making your choices."
cancer,2011-09-22,"Discerning Mercury helps you see what's wrong in someone's grand scheme today, preventing you from investing too much time or money in a project that probably won't bring a healthy return. However, your critical thinking may be perceived by others as negative energy that you need to overcome. The truth is somewhere in the middle, and it's up to you to find common ground that works for everyone involved."
leo,2011-09-22,"Focusing on what value you can bring to the group is a useful exercise today. Your process can teach you something very important, even if you don't say anything about it to others now. But the Moon's visit to your 12th House of Spirituality can create magic from the simplest routines. For example, the task of paying bills could be satisfying if you keep your mind on what's real."
virgo,2011-09-22,"You prefer a bit of peace and quiet rather than wanting extra noise in your environment. However, you still might be attracted to acquiring as much data as you can today. Unfortunately, possessing all the facts is less important now than being sure of where you stand. Be careful; your optimism can tempt you to mislead yourself and others."
libra,2011-09-22,"Deciding what you want out of a partnership can make the difference between success and failure. However, you may need a more realistic outlook on your overall life now before you concentrate your efforts on the mysteries of love. Don't try so hard today; relationships will work better if you don't oversell your case."
scorpio,2011-09-22,"Expressing your ideas about intimacy and actually being intimate with someone special are obviously not the same things. It's easier to approach this delicate subject from the point of view of an observer now, even if you would prefer to just jump in. Remember, fostering a bit of emotional detachment helps you deal with your passions more effectively than being completely engulfed by them."
sagittarius,2011-09-22,"Although you can describe a general concept today, you might not be able to drill down to the key details. Today's opinionated Jupiter tricks you into believing that you can separate the most useful ideas from your unrealistic fantasies. Meanwhile, an indulgent Venus-Jupiter alignment makes it tough to know your limits. There's nothing wrong with feeling optimistic; just think twice before making a critical decision."
capricorn,2011-09-22,"You can be easily charmed by someone who acts flirtatiously toward you today, but other people's smooth talking leads to trouble if you're not careful. The Moon's presence in your 7th House of Relationships increases your sensitivity, so it's best to know your limits and honor them. Normally, you are able to apply cool logic to an emotionally charged situation, but you would be wise now to slow down and consider the consequences of your actions instead of just following your instincts."
aquarius,2011-09-22,"You may be feeling very creative now, but your brain needs a little rest and relaxation. You're tired of struggling to transform your best ideas into something concrete. Unfortunately, if you aim too high, you could grow frustrated and give up prematurely. However, if you are hesitant to set goals, then you might not get around to doing the extraordinary work of which you are capable. Get out of your head long enough to recharge your batteries and then start fresh tomorrow."
pisces,2011-09-22,"Your friends at work can be just what you need today, especially if they support your efforts. But your expectations are so high now that someone might fall short of them and disappoint you. Nevertheless, it's crucial to appreciate the people in your life; there is way too much going on for you to waste energy on expressing any negativity."
aries,2011-09-23,"It's not always easy to acknowledge your need for independence in a relationship while also wanting to be fully present for your partner. Often, these two desires seem mutually exclusive, but now you believe that you can do both. Unfortunately, your partner might have a different set of expectations, so be specific and clarify exactly what you want. Reaching a solid understanding of each other's perspective is the safest way to avoid heartbreak."
taurus,2011-09-23,"Although it's in your best interest to please a good friend or a lover, you could go overboard today and do too much. It's entirely possible to miss the point if you try to fix everything, just because you're more comfortable when others are happy. However, it's not your job to solve everyone else's problems. Your best strategy is to offer your shoulder to lean on, be an attentive listener and then share your thoughts and feelings, only if asked. Maintaining your emotional balance is probably the best thing you can do now for someone you love."
gemini,2011-09-23,"You might see yourself as a superhero who rescues the day by helping your friends escape to have fun. Energetic Mars in playful Leo harmonizes with brilliant Uranus in your 11th House of Social Networking. Nevertheless, forget about showing off and impressing others with your clever repartee. Don't try to run the show; just enjoy the fact that you are a valuable member of the pack."
cancer,2011-09-23,"You're eager to have things go your way now, yet you may feel secure enough to run things from backstage. You don't want anonymity; you want to be acknowledged for your contribution. However, you're not interested in being the center of attention. Ultimately, you'll be happier if you don't worry about how others judge you. It's healthier to concentrate on the present moment so you can react quickly and effectively, regardless of what anyone else thinks."
leo,2011-09-23,"The melodramatic Leo Moon joins feisty Mars in your 1st House of Personality, encouraging you to let others know exactly how you feel. But you could come on too strong if you forget to consider their opinions, too. Slow down and think about what you're going to do instead of just doing it. Adding a short time delay to your responses will improve your chances of making the best decision the first time around."
virgo,2011-09-23,"Your emotions may be out of control today, but ironically you're still able to hide them. It's challenging to find a mental resting place as your thoughts bounce around all over the map. Although your instincts will probably steer you right, it may be smarter to postpone any major decisions now until you've had time to let your best plan develop for a few more days."
libra,2011-09-23,"The tension between you and others grows now that the Sun has returned to your sign and moves toward an opposition with wild Uranus. You are feeling a primal contradiction between your needs and what others want today. Your desires are so strong that you won't take no for an answer. Relaxing is probably out of the question, but you need to find a way to express your individuality without going to extremes."
scorpio,2011-09-23,"You may feel so anxious today that you're ready to jump right out of your skin. Unfortunately, calming your nerves is tricky business now, especially if you are motivated to accomplish a lot at work. You can be busy all day, but your restlessness may have you skipping around from job to job without finishing anything. Making many small adjustments throughout the day can ease your frustration, but won't solve the deeper problem. Luckily, channeling your excess energy into a healthy physical outlet can take the edge off."
sagittarius,2011-09-23,"You may be so excited today that you forget to do what you previously promised. Instead, you're tempted to run off and chase the possibility of a good time. Be careful or you might have to pay the price later if you choose to avoid your obligations. Fortunately, you can respond by saying ""not yet"" instead of ""yes"" when invited out to play. Finish your work before losing yourself in the potential pleasures of your day."
capricorn,2011-09-23,"You are eager for some excitement in your life and you're tempted to stir up a bit of mischief in a relationship or at work just for the fun of it. Unfortunately, you can become so serious about having a good time that you end up creating more trouble than you bargained for today. Thankfully, any instability that surfaces now should settle down pretty quickly over the days ahead."
aquarius,2011-09-23,"Today's spirited Moon-Mars conjunction in your 7th House of Relationships offers a lot of dynamic interactions all around you. Distractions can be interesting now, but they also might prevent you from getting much-needed rest and relaxation. Don't work yourself up into a state of high anxiety if time starts to slip away before you begin to enjoy the day. Instead, be flexible with your schedule; it takes much more energy to fight the tide than simply going with it."
pisces,2011-09-23,"You may have the need to express yourself at work today, yet you're not likely to toe the party line. Your actions can be surprising to your co-workers, but somehow you seem to be able to get away with more than usual. Although you tend to do things your own way now, your approach can be novel enough that others are more intrigued than upset. Following your creative whims is a wonderful idea as long as you don't take things too far."
aries,2011-09-24,"An unexpected change in your plans may prove to be a lot of fun, but only if you're able to be flexible and adapt quickly to what's going on. Be sure to stay focused on the present moment, rather than worrying about a past action that cannot be changed. You might not be completely clear about someone else's motives, yet there's no reason to assume that anything is wrong. Ultimately, expressing your feelings as clearly as possible will keep the energy moving in a positive direction."
taurus,2011-09-24,"It's hard to make up your mind today because there are two distinct paths to choose from. On one hand, you may want to stay home and do something creative like redecorating a room or beginning an art project. On the other hand, there are chores to be done that could entail a bit of running around -- and the sooner you get going, the sooner you'll be done. Luckily, taking care of your errands early in the day will give you more personal time later on."
gemini,2011-09-24,"Even with a clear sense of purpose today you might not make as much progress as you expect. It's as if you're speaking a foreign language; you can express yourself succinctly, yet others still don't understand what you're saying. Thankfully, your direct actions will convey your message more efficiently than rambling on with words that are not authentically connected to your heart."
cancer,2011-09-24,There is no need to fritter away your day worrying about what others might think of your current plan to enjoy yourself. Keep in mind that any activity that's in alignment with your core beliefs -- even if it doesn't move you closer to your goals -- is still better than maintaining the status quo. Being true to yourself is more important than living up to anyone else's expectations.
leo,2011-09-24,"You are eager to show others your best side, especially now with Mars and the Moon in your expressive sign. But somehow your good intentions seem to get lost in one too many cliches. Instead of talking about what you want to do next, just jump in and do it. Today, more than ever, your actions speak louder than your words."
virgo,2011-09-24,"It can be confusing today if other people's behaviors don't seem to support what they are saying. However, the difference between their statements and their actions begins to make sense when you realize that something important has been purposefully left out of the conversation. Instead of struggling trying to find the missing piece now, wait patiently for the rest of the story to come out into the open. Sometimes you just have to accept the fact that not everyone operates as logically as you do."
libra,2011-09-24,"Although your friends might invite you to join them in fun activities, you're still aware of the tension that is building in an important relationship. Fortunately, you have the right words now to reduce the stress, but your sweet pleasantries don't really touch the underlying issues. Nevertheless, it's helpful to enjoy yourself while you can and save your energy for when you will need it over the next few days."
scorpio,2011-09-24,"A stage magician draws your attention to one hand, while the other one is doing something he doesn't want you to see. Similarly, you may appear to be playing your cards out in the open now, but with several planets hanging out in your 12th House of Privacy, you are able to hide the real action from full view. Don't waste too much energy on keeping secrets since others won't likely even notice that they're missing anything. Wait until you're in the right company before sharing the complete story."
sagittarius,2011-09-24,"You may have mixed feelings about your friends now. On one hand, you see them as generously offering you a ticket to an adventure that's within easy reach. But on the other hand, you aren't sure that their trip is exactly the one you want to go on, so you're also thinking about heading off on your own. Fortunately, you don't need to make any long-term decisions yet. Whatever you choose to do today, don't take things too seriously because it could all change tomorrow."
capricorn,2011-09-24,"You have clear goals, but they seem so far away from your current day-to-day affairs. This apparent gulf might make you feel ambivalent now about what you should be doing to realize your potential. You could even entertain the idea of giving up and changing your direction drastically. Although you may feel an urgent need to make some quick decisions today, let this wave of intensity pass before you alter your current course."
aquarius,2011-09-24,"A close friend or partner may brighten your day by making you an offer you cannot refuse. Even if you have good reasons to turn down a social invitation, saying yes is still probably a good idea. Enjoying yourself now while you can makes sense because your life will only grow more chaotic and complicated in the days ahead. It's not like you are avoiding your responsibilities; they'll still be there when you return."
pisces,2011-09-24,"Boredom can set in today, turning what should be a relaxing day into a study in frustration. Your restlessness tempts you to change your plans at the last minute in order to save you from feeling trapped. Nevertheless, it still makes more sense for you to stick close to your regular Saturday routine than to break rank and do something totally different. You're better off making your great escape tomorrow."
aries,2011-09-25,"You think you're being clear about your needs today, but you still may be sending mixed messages unintentionally. On the other hand, a close friend or partner can run hot and cold, leaving you unsure about where you stand. Ultimately, the shifting energy is quite exciting if you're able to let go of control. But trying to force your agenda on anyone else is a sure invitation to trouble. Your best strategy is to ride the shifting waves without being attached to any one outcome."
taurus,2011-09-25,"The intensity of your emotions prompts you to retreat so you can be alone today. However, if social activities require you to be around others too much, you might lose your temper and say things you quickly regret. Don't allow yourself to use harsh words that could undermine a stable relationship. Your key word for the day is cooperation; if anyone wins, then everyone loses."
gemini,2011-09-25,"You may be feeling the incongruity between your individual needs and your social responsibilities today. Unfortunately, you might believe that you have to sacrifice one for the other, but this isn't necessarily true. Although you're traversing some pretty tricky relationship territory now, the key to your success is in finding balance -- even if you must settle for less than you want. As always, honesty works best if you can combine telling the truth with kindness."
cancer,2011-09-25,"You have a very specific idea of how you want to appear to others today, but it may be tough to carry out your plan if your true feelings get in the way. You might think that taking a stand to establish your boundaries is important, but direct confrontation won't bring you the happiness you seek. Instead of working with a fixed agenda now, be as flexible as possible. Allowing for the element of surprise can turn a tense situation into a real thrill ride."
leo,2011-09-25,"You thought you knew what you were doing, but your plans may come back up for reconsideration today. You realize that your old road has ended, but the new one isn't as easy to find as you expected. The next phase of your life could take you in an entirely new direction, but it's harder to make big decisions now because so much is up in the air. Don't focus on the uncertainty; take definitive action, even if you think that you might change your mind again tomorrow."
virgo,2011-09-25,"You might try to keep your feelings to yourself as the Moon returns to cool Virgo today, but you won't likely be able to prevent an emotional eruption. You have run out of patience and may think that you have to do something immediately or you'll lose your chance. Just remember that initiating action is easy now, but you won't be able to just hit the undo button tomorrow."
libra,2011-09-25,"Your diplomatic skills are being tested and you may not be as sweet and nice as others expect. The Sun is in your gracious sign, yet its opposition to shocking Uranus today and its square to dark Pluto midweek releases buried emotions as they erupt to the surface. You're uncharacteristically willing to take a big risk now. Still, it's a smart idea to avoid confrontation and see where the energy goes before making any drastic moves."
scorpio,2011-09-25,"The practical Virgo Moon is in your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes, yet you're inadvertently flirting with emotional explosives as revolutionary Uranus urges you to throw caution to the wind. Areas of your life that once felt safe and secure are now feeling chaotic and vulnerable. Fortunately, you have an inspirational message that could have a positive effect on others. Choose your words carefully and stay strong in your convictions."
sagittarius,2011-09-25,"The picky Virgo Moon's presence in your 10th House of Career may require you to work extra hard today, but shifty Uranus suggests that your day won't turn out as you expect. A surprising event can be a powerful catalyst that initiates a chain reaction, releasing suppressed emotions. But this isn't necessarily your battle to fight. Setting clear boundaries helps you move through this complicated time with confidence and grace."
capricorn,2011-09-25,"You're tempted to rebel at home as unruly Uranus opposes the Sun from your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. Fortunately, the earthy Virgo Moon helps you to suppress some of the craziness and encourages you to maintain the status quo. However, a simple twist of fate can suddenly lead you in an entirely new direction and have you singing a whole new song."
aquarius,2011-09-25,"The willful Sun illuminates your key planet Uranus today, demonstrating how comfortable you are with radical change. Still, you don't need to let every single person know how you feel. Nevertheless, don't wait for external encouragement before sharing your ideas with someone you trust. Being extra perceptive enables you to manage this rather chaotic day with a healthy perspective and a good sense of humor."
pisces,2011-09-25,"Someone may push you too far today, but you could be the one who ends up in trouble if you respond with equal intensity. Although you might think that you can take on anyone now, especially if you're feeling self-righteous, caution is advised. Unfortunately, you can have the best of intentions while still overstepping boundaries. Respect other people's limits or you'll just waste a lot of time and energy pleading your case in vain."
aries,2011-09-26,"Although you have plenty on your plate today, you can still find time for a quick escape as the Sun and Mercury in your 7th House of Others helps you balance your serious work with a bit of fun. Fortunately, you can accomplish a whole lot in short bursts of energy throughout the day. Nevertheless, the real key to success now stems from your ability to concentrate and extend each creative period. The longer you focus on each individual task, the more productive you will be."
taurus,2011-09-26,"A series of unexpected twists and turns at work today could lead you to reconnect with an old friend or make the acquaintance of a new one. You might try to remain cool and detached, but you'll probably be surprised, nonetheless, if intense feelings suddenly catch you off guard. Don't resist the energetic flow now; enjoy the excitement while it lasts."
gemini,2011-09-26,"You really don't need a second round of coffee or tea today because you're already buzzing without the extra caffeine. However, you may be somewhat scattered in your actions, even if your intentions are good. A tug-of-war between erratic Uranus and quicksilver Mercury is enough to give you a case of the jitters. Fortunately, you can work off some of the nervous energy with a bit of strenuous physical activity, enabling you to regain some semblance of control over your day."
cancer,2011-09-26,"Life's little emergencies today keep you hopping from one minor crisis to the next. Even if you're not looking to make mischief, you're quick to feed into it now. However, your impulsive response time can be a mixed blessing if you try to come up with a solution before you even have all the facts. Be wise and make sure that you have enough information prior to taking charge."
leo,2011-09-26,"Someone may throw you a curve ball today when his or her plans suddenly change. Your reaction may be to step back while you determine how this unexpected shift will ultimately impact your life. Although the interaction may be intellectual rather than emotional, it still gives you a chance to improve an important relationship. Instead of withdrawing, acknowledge your feelings. You may end up growing closer to each other if you take the time to sit down and discuss what's happening."
virgo,2011-09-26,"You're emotionally on edge today, yet still appear calm enough that no one realizes what you're experiencing. Ironically, your anxiety could leak out through your behavior anyhow, even if you are trying your best to play it cool. However, it's really not worth the extra effort to hide your feelings, for others will be more inclined to admire you if they see that you're being real and authentic."
libra,2011-09-26,"You may feel as if you've stepped onto a wild ride and you're no longer in control as the Sun and Mercury in your sign rattle outrageous Uranus in your 7th House of Others. Although no one seems to be following your plan today, it can be more exciting than frustrating figuring out what will happen next. Don't try to exert your authority now; it will only make you realize that you're not in charge. Instead, enjoy the uncertainly and the thrills while they last."
scorpio,2011-09-26,"You might attempt to go about your normal daily routine today, but things run amok even if you attempt to keep them on track. You may believe that you can put your schedule back together if you just try hard enough, but your day grows more unmanageable no matter what you do. It seems counterintuitive, but relinquishing control ultimately helps you regain it."
sagittarius,2011-09-26,"Your willingness to act in an unconventional manner today could lead to a wonderful experience. You might even be so excited that you do something totally outrageous without much forethought. Luckily, you may be happily surprised by the approval you receive from your friends or co-workers. Just don't go too far out on a limb or you'll be paying for your irresponsibility sooner than you think."
capricorn,2011-09-26,"You have responsibilities to manage at work, yet a personal situation might add an unexpected twist to your day. You can't just walk away from your previous obligations, but don't use this as an excuse to avoid your feelings. Instead of overcompensating and trying to play the role of a superhero, see where your emotions lead you before taking any drastic action."
aquarius,2011-09-26,"You may be thinking ahead toward the holiday season, even if it's still months away. Perhaps you have an opportunity to squeeze in a quick weekend getaway. Or maybe you're considering a new course of study with several planets traveling through your 9th House of Education. Don't let others tell you that your advanced planning is a waste of energy. The truth is that dreaming about the future makes you happy and causes no harm."
pisces,2011-09-26,"If a financial issue unexpectedly pops up today, it's wise to jump in and take care of it immediately. Handling the problem right away can prevent it from developing into a more serious one. Even if it's an insignificant mistake, ignoring it is like asking for a major headache later on. Save the pain and frustration by being responsible with your money now while it's still a simple matter."
aries,2011-09-27,"Today's New Moon emphasizes your 7th House of Partnerships, shifting your attention from your personal needs toward those of your friends. You instinctively know what others need and make them feel at ease now before they are even aware of your swift intervention. Don't be overly intrusive by assuming everyone wants your help. There may not be a valid reason to get involved unless you are asked. Sometimes good intentions aren't enough."
taurus,2011-09-27,"The diplomatic Libra New Moon lands in your 6th House of Employment, making it easier for you to prioritize your tasks and negotiate which jobs can be delayed and which must be done right away. You can turn on the charm, enabling you to work well with with others. Fortunately, you're able to keep up with everything that happens today, even if your efforts aren't appreciated until later."
gemini,2011-09-27,"The next few weeks may bring you a new love or revitalize a current relationship. The lovely Libra New Moon reignites your 5th House of Romance and Creativity, which is a propitious sign for you to accomplish as much as you can today. Don't hesitate; getting started quickly will free up more time later on for pleasurable pursuits."
cancer,2011-09-27,"Walking down Memory Lane isn't a new experience, yet today it raises significant issues that you have already considered. Luckily, you can manage your emotions in order to avoid a difficult situation. Nevertheless, don't get lost in your nostalgic meanderings. Instead, strive to concentrate on the present moment, rather than slipping off into dreamland."
leo,2011-09-27,"Although you would like to believe that you know what's best for you now, it's still necessary to take enough time to consider the wishes of those around you. Even if you are trying to demonstrate your independence, it's difficult to set your schedule today before you talk with others in your group. Once you know more about their needs, you'll be able to better determine your agenda for the day."
virgo,2011-09-27,"You must make a decision about money today, but your options aren't as definitive as you wish. Unfortunately, the indecisive Libra New Moon in your 2nd House of Finances makes it difficult to get the perspective you were seeking. You may go back and forth without being able to choose, but nothing positive will stem from being too hard on yourself. Wait a few days before completely committing one way or the other."
libra,2011-09-27,"Today's New Moon in your sign signals a sudden break from your past if you are ready to place your new intentions into action. But first you must express your desires clearly enough so they can have the impact you desire. Channeling your ideas into practical goals can get you going, but enthusiasm isn't the only thing that counts. There's no getting around that you must follow through with perseverance and good old-fashioned hard work."
scorpio,2011-09-27,"Although you're usually able to keep a secret at any cost, a particular issue could be the source of trouble today. You really want to tell someone everything you know because you believe it will increase your intimacy. Unfortunately, you could go against your promise and spill the beans. But your confidence might be low and you could feel as if whatever you do will turn out wrong. Postpone your conversation until later in the day, when you will have more objectivity at your disposal."
sagittarius,2011-09-27,"Your social calendar is already jumping, but now you get to take the energy up a notch since the Libra New Moon emphasizes your 11th House of Friends. Give yourself plenty of time to bask in stimulating discussions with like-minded people. Don't wait too long to gather a group together, for everyone benefits when you share your dreams and your optimistic visions about what ahead."
capricorn,2011-09-27,"Today's Libra New Moon falls in your 10th House of Public Responsibilities, stirring your ambitions and reminding you of all that you have accomplished. But there still may be more for you to do before starting a new project. Consider the pros and cons of taking on more work prior to saying yes on a job that could leave you exhausted. Creating a healthy balance between work and play is ultimately more fulfilling."
aquarius,2011-09-27,You have an opportunity to expand your horizons now by investigating an exciting and innovative idea. Gathering information about different courses of study should help you decide about school or additional on-the-job training as today's New Moon activates your 9th House of Higher Education. Just don't limit the possibilities to practical subjects; go ahead and break out of your self-imposed limitations by exploring a wildly different subject.
pisces,2011-09-27,"Your compassionate approach to other people's problems can open a door to the possibility of greater intimacy now that the gracious Libra New Moon falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Don't let your fear of the unknown stand between you and someone special. Instead, maintain a balanced approach to the mysteries of love. Exploring the uncharted shadows of a relationship isn't as scary as it might seem at first."
aries,2011-09-28,"Sometimes you forget how forceful you can sound when trying to make your point. You might actually think that you're the only person who sees the whole truth. Unfortunately, your overconfidence can frustrate your friends and associates today. You'll get along better with everyone if you just remember that others have the same right as you to their perspectives -- even if they conflict with yours."
taurus,2011-09-28,"You may not be comfortable if you're put in a position where you have to defend your position today. You might even try to sidestep an important issue by avoiding a direct confrontation. However, conflict becomes more likely if you don't face the differences head-on. Fortunately, everyone will feel more relieved after everything is out in the open."
gemini,2011-09-28,"Your mind has been racing so fast that it's challenging to grab on to any one thought. Today, however, you are determined to follow through and discuss a creative project with someone you trust. Unfortunately, your conversation may take on a life of its own, leading you away from your original idea. Be smart and write down your thoughts so you can stay on track with your message."
cancer,2011-09-28,"You may get angry if you cannot express yourself today, especially if others make you so uncomfortable that you are afraid to say what's on your mind. You might feel energetically blocked, which negatively impacts your productivity. But don't shift blame onto someone else if you're having trouble finishing what you started. Instead, focus your energy on work and concentrate on one task at a time."
leo,2011-09-28,"You're excited about having so many choices today, but a co-worker probably has a very different idea about what you should be doing. Unfortunately, attempting to get others to understand your point of view now might only provoke more resistance. Keep in mind that everything probably seems more critical than it actually is, so consider relinquishing a bit of control for the sake of playing nicely with others."
virgo,2011-09-28,"Your key planet Mercury is up against a formidable adversary today as it squares powerful Pluto. You may have shared an idea or started a project in the past few days, yet now you might feel as if your task is more challenging than you thought. Nevertheless, you feel unstoppable and aren't in the mood to negotiate. But your uncharacteristic aggression can create more problems than you realize. Take several deep breaths and think your next steps through before you swing into action."
libra,2011-09-28,"You want to be fair about a decision you must make today, but your actions also concern others and they probably won't agree with your choice. Heightened tensions can precipitate an emotional meltdown, especially if someone is trying to coerce you to play favorites. You may prefer to work out your disagreements peacefully, but standing up to a bully can be exactly what's needed now to settle things once and for all."
scorpio,2011-09-28,"The peaceable Libra Sun squares your ruling planet Pluto today, driving your passions to the surface. You would like to express your true feelings, without concern about the consequences, yet the Sun in your 12th House of Secrets reminds you that someone close to you can have a totally different perspective. Relationships are already complex enough these days, so think twice before saying something that only complicates things further."
sagittarius,2011-09-28,"Your friends may not be a source of solace today because they could disagree with you on a fundamental issue, making it difficult for you to feel at ease. You won't be so quick to let your guard down once you become aware of the gulf between you and others. Instead of falling into the trap of thinking someone must be wrong now, create a larger philosophical framework that can hold many divergent opinions."
capricorn,2011-09-28,"You may be ambivalent about taking charge of a project today because you're not sure about the best way to reach the objectives. Unfortunately, it might ultimately require more effort to say no than to step up to the plate and just do what's being asked of you. You stand to better your professional status by demonstrating your competence, so think through your options carefully before selecting your route to success."
aquarius,2011-09-28,"Your unorthodox approach to life usually allows you to rationalize your most eccentric ideas, but you might feel overly secretive about your current thinking today. Someone may even accuse you of being negative, but that's just because you haven't disclosed what's motivating your decisions. Your intuition is steering you in the right direction; others won't understand you now even if you try to explain yourself. Letting your unexpressed thoughts ride for a day or two is your best strategy at this time."
pisces,2011-09-28,"You want to get to the bottom of something you've been unable to understand, but it may not be so easy now to put all the facts into one coherent story. Even if you try to share what you know, your co-workers might not be very receptive since Pluto in your 11th House of Friends squares communicator Mercury in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. If you find yourself participating in an unnecessary conflict, quietly back away from the situation. You can always reengage the discussion once everyone's emotions settle down."
aries,2011-09-29,"You are ready to fight anyone who is slowing you down now, but you could end up wasting energy and exhausting yourself for no reason. Although you may be feeling isolated from a friend or lover today, your current situation ultimately serves you well if you simply learn your lesson. Admit that you can make mistakes and then proceed with caution the next time around."
taurus,2011-09-29,"Somber Saturn and your key planet Venus may issue you a harsh reality check today. Normally, you get along well with others at work, but now it could seem as if they are on your case as tenderhearted Venus runs up against stern Saturn in your 6th House of Employment. Don't worry too much about working on your own; thankfully, interactions will begin to feel lighter again tomorrow."
gemini,2011-09-29,"The good times could grind to a screeching halt today if you are expecting too much all at once. However, if you maintain your common sense, it's time for you to seal the deal. There's no need to be afraid of acting on your desires today, assuming you are sticking with the facts and are not looking for any kind of free ride."
cancer,2011-09-29,"You may feel the burden of responsibility because you want to provide solid information to someone you love so he or she can make the best decision. You might take yourself rather seriously today and expect everyone else to acknowledge your authority. Unfortunately, no matter how much you want to help others, they still must decide for themselves. Offer whatever advice you can and then give them sufficient space and time to choose according to their own criteria."
leo,2011-09-29,"Patience comes to you today when you need it most, even if you're feeling pressure from others. Separating your needs from those around you can help you justify your desire to take things more slowly now. Don't bother trying to explain why you're hesitating; just trust your instincts and wait a while. You'll feel the energy shift in a day or two and should be ready to begin at that time."
virgo,2011-09-29,"You know exactly what you want now and can see how it differs from the needs of others. In fact, you may even find a way today to mediate between the extreme points of view. You think that you understand what's going on, but you might not be able to turn the present moment into a success story. Nevertheless, don't try to force any issues, even if it means that you must delay an important decision for a while longer."
libra,2011-09-29,"You are emotionally self-restrained today since the austere Venus-Saturn conjunction is occurring in your sign. You might feel as if your friends aren't actively supporting you, but it isn't useful to make things any worse by blaming them for their lack of motivation. Acknowledge others for who they are and not for what they can or cannot do on your behalf."
scorpio,2011-09-29,"The Moon's return to your sign reflects your high level of emotionality, so it's challenging to hide your feelings now. Someone you love might promise a lot today, yet you still want to see concrete results. Don't get lost in such high expectations that you end up being disappointed when they can't be met. Keep bringing your dreams back down to earth and don't believe everything you hear. You'll feel better once you step back and gain perspective."
sagittarius,2011-09-29,"You might prefer staying out of sight today with the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Escapism. However, you'll probably have a lot more fun if you purposefully place yourself in the flow of things. Nevertheless, you might not feel very social now and it's your choice if you decide to bow out of a previous commitment at the last minute. There's no reason for you to justify your feelings as long as you remember to be nice when you say no."
capricorn,2011-09-29,"You may be working harder than you prefer now, but your heart isn't necessarily in your current job. You would rather be doing something that enables you to progress along your ideal career path, yet you're willing to set aside your feelings while you earn some discretionary expense money. Don't let your disappointment show today; waiting for just a few more days will bring you closer to what you want."
aquarius,2011-09-29,"Constrictive Saturn aligns with lovely Venus in your 9th House of Journeys today, making it tough to nail down your plans for the future. Whether you want to go back to school or head to a tropical island, you can't see around the next corner now. A sensible strategy is to work toward being in the present moment while remaining open to the powerful magic of destiny."
pisces,2011-09-29,"It's difficult to sink in and feel what's going on in a current relationship today. And although your interactions with others are productive, operating strictly in an analytical mode can be very limiting. But don't worry if it seems as though little progress is being made; it may take some time to see measurable results."
aries,2011-09-30,"You might feel invincible today, but in reality you are not. Your ruling planet Mars is working in your favor now, but your courage and self-assuredness could make you sloppy. Be sure to have all your facts in order and don't skip over any details, even if you're sure that you'll succeed without them. An intelligent strategy and solid preparation will add the winning touch to your game."
taurus,2011-09-30,"Slowing down in order to do something right is one of your strengths. Others may rush ahead, but you are patient as you build a foundation that's capable of sustaining your growth. However, today you may be tempted to push forward in a burst of excitement. Containing your enthusiasm now is challenging, but it's the smartest course of action."
gemini,2011-09-30,"You are in your astrological element with four planets currently traveling in airy Libra. Your ability to have fun while engaging the world on multiple levels makes you appear like a magician, but your charm and cleverness can also get in your way of being truly authentic. Take extra time to deepen a connection you already have now, instead of just running off to make a new one."
cancer,2011-09-30,"You may feel slightly agitated as you attempt to recover from yesterday's emotional meltdown. Fortunately, you feel more lighthearted once the Moon moves into your 5th House of Play. However, you're challenged to stay aware of your emotions, for you are tempted to hide them as they build in power. Take time to check in with your heart. Others will appreciate your ability to remain present and vulnerable at the same time."
leo,2011-09-30,"Irrepressible Mars in your sign continues to energize you Lions and Lionesses, and today you receive an extra boost from its supportive sextile to the radiant Sun. Your mind is still running on high-octane fuel, but it's easy to underestimate the time it takes to complete a job. Don't miss this opportunity to further your cause, but observe when the mood shifts later this evening and be prepared to ease off on the accelerator when necessary."
virgo,2011-09-30,"Sometimes you don't know how to be assertive enough to get your best ideas heard by others. Today, however, your path is wide open, even if you don't want to take the most direct approach. Just remember that you could overdo stating your message without even realizing that anyone is listening. Follow your agenda and save the improvisation for another day."
libra,2011-09-30,"Most days you tend to play well with others, and today is no exception. In fact, you might even give up some of your personal power by attempting to make everyone else feel okay. Your friends will accept you for who you are now, rather than for what you do. Don't waste energy trying to create a sense of harmony. Set a good example by moving gracefully toward your own goals, instead."
scorpio,2011-09-30,"Although you have the stamina to come through for others -- especially in a professional situation -- you must be careful now in how you use your power. You are receiving help from unseen dimensions and your coworkers could be overwhelmed by your intensity. For the best results, don't back down from your position, but play it just a little bit cooler today than you actually feel. Some things are better left unexpressed."
sagittarius,2011-09-30,"If you have been thinking about escaping to an exotic place or undertaking a big project, grab the opportunity to assert yourself today while fiery Mars is giving you the extra assistance you need. But don't try to do it alone because you have a pile of planets now hanging out in your 11th House of Friends, so relying on others to be a part of your journey makes a lot of sense. Ultimately, sharing your current experiences will only make them more enjoyable."
capricorn,2011-09-30,"Your desire for professional advancement is highlighted by several planets congregating in your 10th House of Career. Although you may try to put your ambitions into words without stirring up any trouble, communicator Mercury's alignment with pompous Jupiter prompts you to say more than you should. Instead of making amends after the fact, keep your words to a minimum. You're better off now to let your actions speak for you, anyway."
aquarius,2011-09-30,"An enthusiastic person may enter your life today, offering you an exciting opportunity. You could be so eager for something to happen that you start dreaming about all the possibilities without considering the practicalities involved. Although your conversation might not lead to an immediate change in your job, it could lead to something else that's ultimately a positive move. Be patient and try not to prematurely jump to any extreme conclusions."
pisces,2011-09-30,"An overly optimistic family member or roommate may be a nagging source of trouble today. Surrounding yourself with positive people is usually a good idea, but now someone's idealism could be covering up a more complicated issue. Nevertheless, gently asking questions could start a meaningful dialogue that evolves into a deeper discussion. Rely on your natural compassion to guide you as you step into unknown emotional territory."
aries,2011-10-01,"You are wise to exercise caution today because your overconfidence makes you susceptible to acting before you have all the facts. Your contagious exuberance will likely attract others who encourage your reckless behavior. Unfortunately, they won't be so happy if they discover that you've led them down a dead-end street. Rather than taking charge, share the responsibility of leadership. You will flourish now if you champion a team approach."
taurus,2011-10-01,"Bountiful Jupiter in your sign may lead you down a garden path today because things look better than they are in reality. You can't help but marvel at the impossible dreams that seem real enough to touch. It can actually be useful to explore the roads not taken within the safety of your mind. However, you might run into trouble if you attempt to make them come true. Your imagination can be your ally now if you remember to take care of your mundane responsibilities first."
gemini,2011-10-01,"You may feel like a kite that is bouncing around in the breeze after being stuck on the ground for too long. But you might be a bit ungrounded today if you're at the mercy of the changing winds. Fortunately, you can count on some steady currents to empower you to gain altitude. However, you must be careful since there are also strange weather patterns now that make it difficult to know what's coming next. Ultimately, your smartest strategy is to stay flexible until smoother times return."
cancer,2011-10-01,"It's nearly impossible for you to relax today because you are being pushed outside of your comfort zone. Even if you feign enthusiasm, you really want to know more details before you start something new. Unfortunately, you may not have time to do the research now, so you might as well bite the bullet and simply do the best you can. At worst, you'll have an interesting experience while you push up against some of your own natural resistance."
leo,2011-10-01,"Too much reliance on your social charms can put you in an awkward situation today where you end up losing control over what is said. Instead of trying to remain on center stage, it's wiser to do whatever you can to get out of the spotlight. Having some anonymity now gives you more freedom to express yourself later. But if you push your own agenda too soon, your words could backfire on you and delay your progress."
virgo,2011-10-01,"Your life grows more complicated as intellectual Mercury creates an irrational aspect with pompous Jupiter, cajoling you to exaggerate your point of view. Your current tendency to overextend your reach or say more than you intend can set you on a tricky path. Nevertheless, keep the faith; maintaining your vision of the big picture could be enough to keep you on track as you methodically move toward your goals."
libra,2011-10-01,"You are truly inspired today and believe that you can create something extraordinary. However, unexpected opportunities might lure you away from your own project so you can pursue alternative possibilities. Thankfully, your passion also attracts others to your new ideas. Just don't push anyone too hard or you'll quickly feel the resistance kick back at you."
scorpio,2011-10-01,"Although you are inclined to start a project today, it may be smarter to wait a bit before initiating action. It's not that you are heading off in a wrong direction; it's just that your current optimism may encourage you to bite off more than you can chew. Instead of going on a spontaneous spending spree, get some rest. It's smarter to build your reserves now so you're ready for what's to come."
sagittarius,2011-10-01,"Although you might be thinking about striking out on your own, this may not be the best course of action now. Today's exuberant Sagittarius Moon blesses you with extra self-confidence and can send your enthusiasm over the top. However, your best ideas could lose their momentum if your execution is too hasty. Demonstrate your maturity by being patient; if you can wait a little longer, everything might fall into place according to your vision."
capricorn,2011-10-01,"Although you could be very excited about what's happening professionally, listen to your intuition now if it's telling you that it's not quite time yet to make your move. It will be much wiser for you to swing into action on Monday, once the Moon returns to your ambitious sign. Get busy taking care of loose ends and be certain that your strategy is realistic enough to execute."
aquarius,2011-10-01,"Your mind may not be focused on what's going on at home today. Instead, you're time traveling into the future and thinking about all the possible adventures in front of you. Unfortunately, it can get confusing as you weave your hopes and dreams into the current circumstances, making it difficult to tell them apart. Nevertheless, it's healthy to take cues from your fantasies, for they empower you to turn your dreams into reality."
pisces,2011-10-01,"You may be confident that you can change a long-standing habit or make a necessary adjustment to your diet. However, you could be fooling yourself today by oversimplifying what it takes to improve your daily regimen. Don't get discouraged by trying to accomplish too much all at once. Instead of running ahead without a plan, take one determined baby step at a time. Small incremental modifications have a much better chance of lasting into the future."
aries,2011-10-02,"Although you may be eager for the good times ahead, something could happen that catches you off guard today. Even if there isn't anything to do in preparation for a surprise, it's important to remember that reacting with self-restraint is smarter than going to extremes. You might want to respond quickly, but thinking about the consequences of your words or actions first is a very wise plan."
taurus,2011-10-02,"You may attempt to be cool now by downplaying your desires, but the Moon's visit to your 8th House of Intimacy has you thinking about warmer things. You might just throw caution to the wind and surprise someone with your blunt approach. Your boldness may be what's necessary to overcome the resistance, even if you hadn't previously thought out your strategy. You might act without a plan, yet the results could be to your liking."
gemini,2011-10-02,"Usually it's everyone else who holds things together while you flit from one idea to another. However, you may need to shift your tactics now if others are acting indecisively or advising you to take a risk by stepping beyond your normal limits. But don't blame anyone else for your current discomfort. Instead, be as flexible as possible; you might be pleasantly pleased when your gamble turns out in your favor."
cancer,2011-10-02,You may experience a breakthrough in awareness by realizing how you can improve your day without jeopardizing the parts that are already meeting your expectations. But having a good idea isn't significant unless you put your new plan into motion. Don't attempt to do too much today; it's better to take baby steps toward a healthy goal than giant steps leading the wrong way.
leo,2011-10-02,"Your enthusiasm could grow out of hand today, even if you believe that you can't do anything wrong. You might inadvertently offend someone unless you exercise self-restraint. You may come across as overbearing, leading others to think that you're hiding something. Although this is not likely what's happening, it's still smart to avoid this false impression by acting less aggressively. Remember, you don't need to work so hard to get others to understand your intentions."
virgo,2011-10-02,"You usually prefer to take things step by step, but your current excitement may trick you into making lots of changes right away. Unfortunately, following through with your intentions can be difficult if you move too quickly. Although it sounds counterintuitive, you'll accomplish more if you take your time today. Slow down and get it right the first time instead of having to do everything over again."
libra,2011-10-02,"Recent decisions could be critical to your long-term plans, so reconsider your choices before they are set in stone. You would be wise to take time now to contemplate your goals and the most efficient way to reach them. Don't try to justify your lack of productivity today or you might miss your chance to see the bigger picture. Instead of getting caught up in the excitement of the moment, keep your eyes on the prize."
scorpio,2011-10-02,"Your anticipation of the next phase of your life continues to grow, but it's still too soon to make your move. Nevertheless, big changes are already coming your way and you could see things very differently within a couple of weeks. Resist jumping to any half-baked conclusions today; there's still more you can learn prior to making a fully informed choice."
sagittarius,2011-10-02,"Although you're enjoying the upbeat energy and thinking how you could get used to things going your way, nothing is permanent. It isn't that anything's going to change today; it's just that your unrestrained optimism can make you complacent and set you up for disappointment later on. Positive thoughts are powerful, but overconfidence is not, especially if you talk yourself out of putting in extra effort. Remember, if something is important to you, do it right for the sake of your own integrity."
capricorn,2011-10-02,"You may be feeling pressure to expand your field of operations, but might resist because you're not sure that you can deliver on what's expected of you. Nevertheless, you have a few well-rehearsed tricks up your sleeve that enable you to surpass even the harshest of judgments. Unfortunately, you're unable to objectively reflect on your own performance now. Hang tight; an energetic shift within a couple of days should clear your thinking and set you on your way."
aquarius,2011-10-02,"You might be dreaming about some far-off adventure now, even if you're challenged by current circumstances to come back to the present moment. But nothing is to be gained from indulging in self-criticism because your mind is likely to wander all over the mental landscape today, no matter what. Fortunately, your active fantasy life will settle down after a night of restful sleep."
pisces,2011-10-02,"You prefer to maintain a rational view about your current relationships, yet logic won't tell the whole story today. Being cautious is the safest way for some people to move through unknown territory, but you Fish are naturally at home swimming in the boundless waters of feelings. However, you might feel as if you're stranded on a desert island now without any emotional nourishment in sight. Don't worry; this temporary drought won't last long."
aries,2011-10-03,"You cannot control your enthusiasm when your key planet Mars squares optimistic Jupiter today. Self-restraint can be a problem for you even on a good day, but now it's essential to steer clear of trouble. Even if you aren't trying to live dangerously, you could promise the Moon and stars, only to get stuck on the launch pad. Don't ruin a real opportunity by taking on too much."
taurus,2011-10-03,"You could inadvertently hurt someone's feelings if you are overly critical today. You can imagine the possibilities, yet you also see the obstacles. This combination allows you to clearly point out where another person's performance falls short of his or her potential. Don't be so hard on everyone else; just keep doing whatever you can to lead by example."
gemini,2011-10-03,"You may be very busy today, but you would prefer to be relaxing. Your first impulse is to have fun now, yet you realize that the current temptations are testing you in many ways. Don't give in to your inner child just because it sounds like a good idea in the moment; act maturely and do the responsible grown-up thing, instead. You'll feel better about yourself if you do."
cancer,2011-10-03,"It isn't easy to get a handle on your spending now with reckless Mars in your 2nd House of Money, especially if you're thinking about purchasing something special. Consider what you really need before buying a luxury item that you cannot really afford. Unfortunately, an impulsive purchase may leave you feeling empty later on. Look beyond the material world now for a deeper fulfillment."
leo,2011-10-03,"Naturally, you want others to see you at your best. However, you may take this concept a little too far today as irrepressible Mars in your 1st House of Appearances squares overindulgent Jupiter. Keep in mind that it will be more of a struggle if you don't rein yourself in and underplay your position rather than grandstanding and trying to steal the spotlight. Don't worry; you'll have your time in the Sun on another day."
virgo,2011-10-03,"Although your dreams may be unrealistic with unstoppable Mars in your 12th House of Fantasy, you aren't ready to give up on them yet. In fact, you may be very enthusiastic and believe that your thinking is clear, but you might not be aware of how much your own desires are influencing you now. Talk to your allies and ask them for feedback; however, make sure you listen to their valuable input."
libra,2011-10-03,"Benevolent Jupiter in your 8th House of Shared Resources is being prodded by assertive Mars today, bringing the financial aspects of a current relationship to light. Someone might offer you a gift, but he or she will likely show up at some point to collect on a debt or far-fetched promise. If you don't want to face disappointment down the road, don't blow your expectations out of proportion. Being rational now will make life easier later."
scorpio,2011-10-03,"It seems like the positive energy is returning, but you're not sure if it's smart to trust your optimistic feelings. You may still be smarting from a recent brush with authority, yet new ideas could now turn a previous setback to your advantage. Don't worry about winning; just doing your absolute best is good enough."
sagittarius,2011-10-03,"You may go out of your way today to see both sides of a complex issue as your key planet Jupiter squares pushy Mars in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Unfortunately, this exercise in objectivity won't necessarily bring you any closer to resolution. Thankfully, finding a solution now isn't as important as you might think. Just getting all the hidden agendas out into the open is enough of a goal for one day."
capricorn,2011-10-03,"You can see new benefits of having friends who actually support you and your work, and you're eager to pursue these relationships now to expand your professional ambitions. Nevertheless, it still might take you by surprise when someone goes out of his or her way to help you today, without seeking anything in return. Rather than resisting assistance and acting as if you are self-sufficient, graciously accept their help with a smile."
aquarius,2011-10-03,"Your apparent playfulness can push someone else's buttons if he or she thinks you're not carrying your fair share of the load today. Meanwhile, you may believe that you are doing more than your part. If others complain about your lack of effort, your first impulse might be to purposefully slow down in finishing your tasks. However, don't let an ego battle cover up the underlying problem. Show courage and resolve to get to the bottom of the issue instead of just taking the easy way out."
pisces,2011-10-03,"Taking on a lot of tasks today is one way to impress others at first, but your scheme can fall apart quickly if you don't complete enough of what you start. Fortunately, you can break down a large task into many smaller components now and then focus on each one separately. Although a big job may be overwhelming, it's not so bad if you take it one piece at a time."
aries,2011-10-04,"It's difficult to balance your aspirations with those of a close friend or partner. Thankfully, your companions may be flexible enough to accommodate your needs now, yet they might grow annoyed if you don't respond in kind. Rather than expecting everyone else to make adjustments for you, meet others halfway. You may be happily surprised at how easy it is once you give it a try."
taurus,2011-10-04,"You have had plenty of stress recently and are feeling relieved now because everything is settling down. But you might not be totally convinced that the old dramas are really over. Nevertheless, consider taking a mini-vacation today, even if it's only for a few quick hours, as the Moon visits your 9th House of Getaways. Anything you can do to relax helps regenerate your energy for the new cycle that will begin next week."
gemini,2011-10-04,"You may be challenged to find time to relax today because the dutiful Capricorn Moon keeps reminding you of what you promised to do. Instead of procrastinating, settle in for a bit of hard work. You could find the extra effort more energizing than trying to avoid the inevitable. Getting a few chores out of the way should make room for a little escape later on."
cancer,2011-10-04,"You tend to pull in your energy when the cautious Capricorn Moon enters your 7th House of Partners. Ironically, you may feel as relaxed as ever, yet others seem to be overly nervous now -- and their anxiety can rub off on you. Remember, you don't have to adjust your emotions to match someone else's just because you care. Establishing firm boundaries will ultimately make everyone involved more comfortable."
leo,2011-10-04,"It might not be all that easy to motivate yourself because you're lacking your regular zip today. However, you may get swept up by circumstances and you have the excellent fortune of being able to ride on top of a productive wave of energy, leaving a pile of finished work in your wake. However, don't try to do too much all at once. It's better to start slowly and build momentum throughout the day."
virgo,2011-10-04,"Your friends might seem a bit warmer toward you today, but it could be your attitude, rather than theirs, that has changed. A weight is temporarily lifted from your shoulders as the steady Capricorn Moon visits your 5th House of Love and Play. Ironically, you might not feel any differently than usual; however, going the extra mile to have fun will convey an irresistible message to others."
libra,2011-10-04,"You want everyone to be comfortable, but others don't seem to be as receptive as usual to your gracious gestures today. You may grow frustrated as you try all your tricks, but you still don't seem to make any progress. Fortunately, you might just succeed if you stop trying so hard. Instead of attempting to appease others now, do what makes you happy. Leading by positive example works better than unrealistically believing that you can fix everything for everyone else."
scorpio,2011-10-04,"Your friends could be fussier than usual and their picky behavior might start you questioning how far you're willing to go. You appreciate others being honest and telling you what they want; unfortunately, they just don't know when to quit. Remember, you are not a bad friend just because you're unwilling to meet someone's unreasonable demands. Luckily, a confrontation can be easily avoided today if you remember to consider the other person's position while remaining clear about your own boundaries."
sagittarius,2011-10-04,"Sometimes being practical is a drag, and demands on your time today can keep you from your dreams. You might overreact by rambling on about your vision for the future, but you really don't want to get bogged down in all the details. Hopefully, paying attention to the real world creates exactly the balance that you now need."
capricorn,2011-10-04,"You wish that your emotions would make sense now, but they don't. Fortunately, the Moon's visit to your sign helps you reconnect with your feelings. Although you're tempted to fly by the seat of your pants, this is as bad a strategy as getting lost in analysis. Stay away from either extreme today; the best solution will be found closer to the middle of the road."
aquarius,2011-10-04,"You may try hiding your serious demeanor today because you believe that you can throw others off guard if you appear very casual. Unfortunately, your strategy might not work because the hard-nosed Capricorn Moon reveals the fallacy of your assumptions. You need to be showing others how committed you are now. Don't give up; nearly any relationship can grow deeper once you're willing to be your authentic self."
pisces,2011-10-04,"You may be overly cautious today as you think about your future because the pragmatic Capricorn Moon in your 11th House of Aspirations doesn't want you to waste a lot of time and money chasing impractical dreams. Normally, realizing a few fantasies would be enough to keep you motivated, but now you have to get extra creative. Remember, it will take time to reach even your most sensible goals."
aries,2011-10-05,"It's difficult for you to focus on your day-to-day affairs now when your life contains so much uncertainty. You're typically confident about what you are doing, but questions arise today that increase your doubt over the general direction of your life. However, focusing on your long-term goals may be a clever way to escape from your more immediate obligations. Do what you Aries are known for best and concentrate on being in the present moment."
taurus,2011-10-05,"You may be involved in a continuing conflict between your job and more personal activities that truly express what's in your heart. But it's challenging to put your efforts on a path that's closer to your passion when you are being rewarded monetarily for the professional work you do. Instead of choosing one over the other, find ways to bring new life into your creative endeavors through self-discipline. Practicing time management should enable you to juggle your calendar and do everything you want."
gemini,2011-10-05,"Although the Moon in your 9th House of Higher Education may have you thinking about going back to school or beginning a new course of study, you could have to delay your decision for a little while. More pressing obligations can't be ignored and must be handled before returning to your long-term plans. Instead of worrying about what you can't do now, take life a few days at a time until you're free enough to imagine what's ahead."
cancer,2011-10-05,"If somebody presents you with a sensible plan today, remain open to it instead of just assuming that your idea is better. It's presumptuous to think that you can make a real assessment unless you actually take time to consider what you are shown. Don't let your fear of being wrong get in the way of your best course of action. It's more important to reach your goals than to be right."
leo,2011-10-05,"Your job can help to take your mind off a recent conflict in your personal life. However, it's crucial to concentrate all of your attention on your career objectives today in order to shift your thinking. Backing away from an intense argument won't solve the underlying issues, but it will give the energy a chance to settle back down so you can approach the unresolved predicament anew later on."
virgo,2011-10-05,"You tend to overcompensate for your uncertainty today by acting as if you know exactly what's going on and what should be done next. You really want to be perceived as someone who is competent, but your overly authoritative manner may not help your cause. Don't dwell on previous failures now, for your memories can stand between you and success. Remember, the past is over and may not be as relevant in the present moment as you believe."
libra,2011-10-05,"You are tired of having to act in such a responsible manner now, and are willing to take a risk and do something just for the fun of it. Unfortunately, declaring yourself free from prior obligations isn't as satisfying as actually living up to your promises. Take the time early in the day to work hard and make progress on your chores so you can cut loose for a while later on."
scorpio,2011-10-05,"Something that you recently decided to keep to yourself may become an issue now in a relationship. You might realize that you would have been wise to just be fully honest and to share whatever uncertainties you were hiding. Unfortunately, you cannot turn back the hands of time and redo what's been done. Your best bet is to start fresh in the present moment by clearing the air before moving on."
sagittarius,2011-10-05,"You don't like it when your peers put pressure on you to do something you're not willing to do. In fact, you like it even less when workmates attempt to take advantage of you, asking you to help them with chores they should have already completed. Remember, in both cases, the decision is entirely yours. Either jump in fully without complaining, or say exactly what you're thinking and prepare to deal with the consequences."
capricorn,2011-10-05,"You can easily underestimate the amount of time and energy it will take to finish a project today. Unfortunately, this can have a profoundly negative impact on your schedule. Simply working harder might be the best strategy to avoid looking like a fool on the job, but putting in additional hours won't necessarily solve the problem. Don't exhaust yourself in a hopeless attempt to impress others. Instead, rethink your tactics and adopt a smarter approach."
aquarius,2011-10-05,"You are driven to understand what's happening today, but the Moon's return to your sign can make you so emotional that your rational approach doesn't work. It's tricky because your answers might appear so straightforward and rational. However, your thinking is all over the map now, making it nearly impossible to follow through on any one idea. Instead of trying to work it out on your own, ask for help to minimize any subsequent problems."
pisces,2011-10-05,"You may be tired of isolating yourself from others and are finally ready to do something about it. However, you might not be clear about how best to heal a rift between you and a friend. Rather than opening the discussion with a know-it-all attitude, admit that you don't have all the answers. Revealing your vulnerability may be the most sensible way to bridge the gap."
aries,2011-10-06,"You may be feeling pretty good about yourself today, especially if you aren't trying to accomplish too much. However, your unwillingness to acknowledge the limitations of your schedule could prompt someone to rain on your parade. Hitting the wall of resistance isn't much fun but once you accept the circumstances that are beyond your control, you should be able to make the necessary adjustments to your plans."
taurus,2011-10-06,"Your fantasies can be quite enjoyable today, and as long as you don't lose track of reality everything should flow smoothly. Unfortunately, you have work-related obligations to attend to that could stand between you and your pursuit of pleasure. Don't try to avoid your responsibilities; address them first. If you work hard now you should be able to play hard later."
gemini,2011-10-06,"You might be more interested in your future now than you are in what's happening today. However, your attachment to the possibilities ahead may be less about sensible planning than an attempt to escape from your current commitments. Unfortunately, there's too much chaos in the present moment for you to pretend that everything's under control. If you don't take care of the immediate issues right away, they will grow into even more of a problem."
cancer,2011-10-06,"You might not feel at ease in your own home today, but ironically are more comfortable when you head out into the world. A family member or someone close to you may tell you what's on his or her mind, and it might not be good news. It's advisable for you to put on your rhino skin because your feelings could be hurt if you don't take self-protective precautions. Don't wallow in self-doubt; if nothing else, dream yourself out of the temporary malaise."
leo,2011-10-06,"You are able to balance your intuition with common sense today, suggesting progress on many fronts. But you could miss the point if you become so spiritually inclined that you lose your bearings. Observe your reactions before you respond or your fears and attachments could prompt unavoidable negative consequences. If you can keep one foot on the ground, there's a good chance that you'll be able to make real positive change."
virgo,2011-10-06,"You may run into unexpected delays as your key planet Mercury conjuncts karmic Saturn. You won't likely get what you want unless you're willing to work for it. On the other hand, you'll surely be disappointed if you don't give it your all. Today's lesson points out that achieving your goal isn't the only reward. Showing up and playing the game passionately, whether you win or lose, is where you can find the most joy."
libra,2011-10-06,"You can easily work yourself into a funk today as you worry more and more about your future. Ironically, you might not be able to explain your free-floating anxiety because there aren't sufficient real life circumstances to justify your concerns. Ultimately, your future is up to you, so aim high and don't let yourself be distracted by self-doubt."
scorpio,2011-10-06,"You are often the one who can broach a difficult topic for discussion, but sometimes playing this role is exhausting. Your unwillingness to talk about something that no one else wants to acknowledge is reinforced by today's critical Mercury-Saturn conjunction in your 12th House of Secrets. Fortunately, your resistance will pass. Ultimately, there aren't many topics of discussion that are too sensitive or challenging for you, so tackle the unresolved issue once you are back in the mood."
sagittarius,2011-10-06,"You may feel stifled by your friends and co-workers as a naysaying Mercury-Saturn conjunction in your 11th House of Community can bring critical words from an ally. Unfortunately, your desire for change makes it more difficult to manage your response to the current feedback. Although you might not embrace the concept of patience, it is probably your best strategy. For now, err on the side of caution."
capricorn,2011-10-06,"You have something important to say today, and you're going to say it even if it's politically incorrect as your key planet Saturn is activated by loquacious Mercury. But how you deliver your words may be nearly as important as the actual content of your message. Minimize any negative consequences by considering other people's feelings and being as compassionate as possible."
aquarius,2011-10-06,"If you've been planning on taking a trip, today's reality check may cause you to think again. Although you thought that you would be able to escape, your optimism fades, leaving you with a pile of reasons that makes discretionary travel difficult. But don't get discouraged because a fresh wave of hope arrives later in the day as new dreams begin to replace the old ones that didn't come true."
pisces,2011-10-06,"You're willing to accept the limitations placed on you by your work schedule today. Instead of fighting back or negotiating for additional freedom, you may be slightly relieved that others know what you're doing. But this isn't exactly a peaceful, easy feeling because you realize how much is being asked of you. Nevertheless, your concentrated effort should pay off and you'll soon be floating in dreams about a kinder and gentler tomorrow."
aries,2011-10-07,"You might feel as if you're at a fork in the road, but a heavy mist is making it nearly impossible to see what's ahead. Fortunately, you have a network of smart people in your life that are able to give you guidance. But you could place so much trust in others that you forget you are the only one who can decide which way to go. Listen respectfully to everyone's advice and then make your choice based upon what you know without looking back."
taurus,2011-10-07,"Your imagination is very active today as you head into unfamiliar territory. Your fantasies are quite tempting, although your fear of being irrational prevents you from acting too quickly. Remember, it's not important that you respond right away. Avoid further complications by making sure that you are working with correct assumptions prior to moving ahead."
gemini,2011-10-07,"You would be wise to be cautious today rather than setting your sights on something that looks like fun. You could even head off in a new direction before you consider the results of your actions. Just remember that you may be seeing things as you wish them to be, rather than how they are now. Delay any major decisions until tomorrow after your clarity returns."
cancer,2011-10-07,"Being closer to someone you love sounds like a good idea, but today romantic thoughts are more complicated than usual. Even if you think that you know what you're doing, everything could feel differently once you act on your desires. You might even change your mind if you are feeling too vulnerable. It's sensible to move slowly now rather than just rushing ahead, because everything looks good from a distance."
leo,2011-10-07,Your eagerness to trust a friend or partner could land you in a heap of trouble today. It isn't that someone will give you bad advice or purposefully try to mislead you. It's just that reality sounds better than it actually is. Keep in mind that your judgment might be slightly off and that more time is needed to regain a proper perspective.
virgo,2011-10-07,"Staying focused on your current chores may be nearly impossible today as a variety of opportunities drop into your life. However, you don't have to respond immediately in order to take advantage of the situation. In fact, your patience will be rewarded, so slow down before you decide your next move. Be smart and finish your previous tasks prior to starting anything new."
libra,2011-10-07,You may think that you can see the big picture clearly today and you have everyone's best interests in mind. But you could be viewing the future through such a rose-colored lens that you miss something important. Your positive attitude might be more like blind optimism unless you decide to also examine the darker side of your feelings. Don't be afraid of a little self-doubt because it can reveal a perspective that shows the truth.
scorpio,2011-10-07,"Sometimes you have to jump in to an experience passionately without holding back in order to feel everything. However, creating boundaries between your inner and outer worlds is vital to your personal development. Taking time for a spiritual retreat can be helpful now. Balancing your social responsibilities with your desire to escape will help you move through the day without stirring up resentment from those closest to you."
sagittarius,2011-10-07,"It's challenging to make the time to respond to all your emails and phone calls today. But your inability to fit all your work into one day is not your primary problem. The real dilemma comes from your current belief that you can do anything you imagine. However, your reasoning is based on fantasy now instead of reality. Don't agree to take on one more project until you realistically reconsider your workload."
capricorn,2011-10-07,"You may have an unreasonable idea about what you can accomplish now. Aspiring to lofty goals is admirable if it motivates you to push yourself harder. But this isn't such a good idea if your destination is unrealistic. Rather than setting yourself up for failure with your inflated ambitions, try to ground your visions in a more practical manner."
aquarius,2011-10-07,"You could be overly cavalier in your ability to make everything turn out fine today. However, your confidence can lead to exhaustion, especially if you cannot deliver what you previously promised. Strive for objectivity as you make your plans for the future, since working too hard will surely take the fun out of the days ahead."
pisces,2011-10-07,"Relationship issues are tricky today as confusing Neptune and the empathetic Pisces Moon trine vulnerable Venus in your 8th House of Intimacy. But redemption won't come from projecting your fears or worries onto others. Instead, rely on your inner strength to remind you that you already know the truth and can proceed with what you must do."
aries,2011-10-08,"You might wish that you could hide today with the Moon in your 12th House of Privacy, but you have already made promises that prevent you from slipping into a black hole and disappearing from view. Nevertheless, you can become quieter than usual, which may cause others to wonder if you're okay. There's nothing wrong with wanting some personal space. You're not obliged to explain your emotional retreat unless you truly want to, but at least let someone know when you plan on returning."
taurus,2011-10-08,"You're a bit unclear about your specific duties at work today, yet asking your coworkers for clarification may not help you at all. Instead, take a few minutes and make a detailed list of what you think your job entails. This exercise might prove surprising because it enables you to make sense of what you have to do. However, don't hesitate to ask your boss for more direction if you're still uncertain."
gemini,2011-10-08,"You may feel as if you want to take care of everyone at work today, but this isn't a good idea if it distracts you from fulfilling your responsibilities. Fortunately, you should be able to find a healthy balance between helping others and remaining true to yourself. Keep in mind that you will need to establish clear boundaries now so you don't lose yourself in other people's problems. The good you might do for someone else will ultimately be wasted if you let your own life fall apart."
cancer,2011-10-08,"Your dreams of going on a long journey can take on a life of their own today as the Moon visits your 9th House of Faraway Places. However, logical Mercury in your 4th House of Security has you thinking about all the reasons to stay at home. Thankfully, there is a healthy middle ground between these two extremes. Don't be afraid to stretch your limits, but only do what feels safe."
leo,2011-10-08,"Trusting your intuition can help you negotiate an agreement with a business partner today or find common ground with an adversary. Although logic won't necessarily reveal your best strategy, clear communication is necessary in order to get others to understand your position. Don't expect anyone to know what you want by reading your mind. It's up to you to take the time to explain yourself as succinctly as possible."
virgo,2011-10-08,The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partnerships increases your need to interact with others today. But communicating with someone else may put you on tricky ground if either of you assumes that you know what the other person is saying before the words are actually spoken. Don't jump to conclusions or you'll find yourself spending time untangling the knots created by an unnecessary misunderstanding.
libra,2011-10-08,"Sometimes you seem wishy-washy to others because your ability to objectively see both sides of an issue makes it tough for you to choose one over the other. However, today you are quite capable of drawing a specific conclusion based upon the information that you have, even if you know that you're missing some of the facts. Fortunately, what you lack in detail now you can make up in your imagination, and, luckily, you will most likely be correct in your thinking."
scorpio,2011-10-08,"Issues of trust come to the surface today as communicator Mercury in your 12th House of Secrets forms a magical quintile with your ruling planet Pluto. Intuitively, you know what's going on even if no one else wants to talk about it. However, caution is advised because your fears can feed negativity until it's strong enough to be the main character in a story that's not grounded in fact. It's best to talk about your concerns before they grow into a problem that's harder to handle."
sagittarius,2011-10-08,"You may have unrealistic expectations about finding time to relax at home today as the Moon in dreamy Pisces visits your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. You could set your goals so high that you end up being disappointed even if the overall situation isn't bad at all. Nevertheless, it makes sense to involve family members or your housemates in a discussion about any decisions that impact more than just you. Sharing your concerns will lessen the burden."
capricorn,2011-10-08,"Your fair-minded approach to getting ahead professionally should not be mistaken for a laissez-faire attitude. In fact, your easygoing style today can smoothly disarm a possible opponent who doesn't realize that you should be taken very seriously now. However, there's really no need to be overly ambitious because it's better to have supporters than enemies. Ultimately, cooperation is a smarter strategy than competition."
aquarius,2011-10-08,"You might not be able to see your financial picture clearly enough today to make an important decision. Still, you are weighing and balancing the alternatives as you attempt to be as objective as possible in the choices you make. Don't try to convince others that your current options are the best ones because the more you say now the less sensible you sound. Ultimately, your actions really do speak louder than your words."
pisces,2011-10-08,"You may appear to be less certain today than you actually are because the moody Pisces Moon has stopped in for a quick visit to your 1st House of Self. Your feelings seem to be closer to the surface and others know what you're thinking even before you say anything. Instead of withdrawing, fearful that your sensitivity can make you more vulnerable, use this time to share what's in your heart with someone you can trust."
aries,2011-10-09,"Your natural enthusiasm might be tested today, causing you to consider a new approach in a relationship. Intense interactions with a friend or partner could raise issues that reveal the limitations of your current perspective. Even if the facts make you uncomfortable now, ignoring them is not an option. You'll need to push into the unknown if you want to make real progress."
taurus,2011-10-09,"You may be worried about the direction that a relationship has taken, yet you might believe that you still have more time before you have to determine a new course. Typically, you prefer your life to be sweet and simple. However, it's probably a smart idea to leave a few loose ends dangling now. Delay declaring your final decision until the ambiguity begins to fade."
gemini,2011-10-09,"Unraveling your romantic feelings may be a significant part of your day, yet it's difficult to know where your heart will lead you now. You could grow frustrated if you try to force clarity. In the meantime, minimize stress by sticking to your regular routine and get plenty of rest. Making small improvements to your diet and exercise program today is more important than solving the mystery of love."
cancer,2011-10-09,"Even if you're feeling pretty good about yourself today, you're not yet ready to let go of a persistent issue that continues to bother you. Unfortunately, you could obsess over an insignificant molehill until it turns into a formidable mountain. Stay conscious of your thoughts at all times; placing your attention on the positive aspects of love is much healthier than concentrating on the negativity of fear."
leo,2011-10-09,"Although you're feeling pressured to meet your obligations today, you could be tempted to withdraw emotionally and let everyone wait until you return. Your decision to socially disengage might not be well received by someone who wants you to perform, but pleasing others shouldn't be your main concern now. Instead, listen to your intuition and retreat until you feel ready to take on the world."
virgo,2011-10-09,"You might feel insecure about your role in someone else's life today, yet discussing your concerns doesn't seem to help. You cannot find the answers you seek now because the longer the conversation lasts, the less clear your partner becomes. Ironically, your best strategy may be to keep your worries to yourself for a while longer and see where the energy leads. But don't isolate yourself from those you love, for their support is probably exactly what you need."
libra,2011-10-09,"You may still be feeling the weight of responsibility on your shoulders today, even though you rationally know it's not your job to make everything okay. But you're happiest when your friends and family are doing well, so sometimes it's challenging to discern their comfort from yours. There's nothing wrong with helping others, just keep in mind that everyone else needs to contribute a fair share, too."
scorpio,2011-10-09,"You feel as if you're ready to let go of something from the past, but aren't quite sure yet how to move forward. Nevertheless, sweet Venus' return to your sign enables you to get what you want in a relationship. Instead of trying to make progress on an old issue, concentrate on ways to transform your current stress into positive action. Improving the quality of your life in the here-and-now is more important than reaching a new destination."
sagittarius,2011-10-09,"You might choose to spend much of your day at home today, especially since Venus' shift into your 12th House of Privacy makes solitude sound appealing. But postponing a fun social event may not be as good an idea as it seems, for you would benefit from the balance that being with friends will provide. Take control of your life by planning your schedule so you can make time to do it all."
capricorn,2011-10-09,"It's nearly impossible to guess what your future will look like by simply observing what's happening right now. You are continuing on the same trajectory that brought you here, but now you have an opportunity to choose a destination of your liking. Just remember that the current transformations will be gradual and you don't need to know where you're heading just yet. Instead of being lured by all the potential today, take care of one practical task at a time."
aquarius,2011-10-09,"You are driven to tell others exactly what you want today and are eager to get started. However, your ambitions may be more complicated than anyone realizes, making it more difficult to justify your goals. Keep in mind that your dreams don't have to be public knowledge yet. Your personal choices are a private matter until you're ready to reveal them."
pisces,2011-10-09,"Your hopes are high, but you may not know what to do now in order to reach your goals. With the dreamy Moon in your sign today, it's not a good idea to put pressure on yourself to create a plan. Instead, just keep refocusing your attention on your ideal destination and make each decision based upon whether your response furthers your progress or not. This radical strategy requires you to trust in the universe; fortunately, having faith isn't that difficult for you."
aries,2011-10-10,"You're riding on an adrenaline surge today and although you like it, you'd be happier if you thought you were in charge of your own life. As it is, you might have authority over some things, but the larger waves are completely out of your control. Don't bother wasting your time attempting to change circumstances that are beyond your reach; instead, focus on responding to the shifting currents as best as you can."
taurus,2011-10-10,"You might not feel very relaxed today, yet you can be very productive if you forget about trying to take the day off. Ironically, you may enjoy doing mundane chores around the home or office once you get into gear. But don't seek approval from anyone else; unfortunately, others probably won't tell you what you want to hear now. Work for the satisfaction of a job well done."
gemini,2011-10-10,"This can be an exciting day if you aren't afraid of trying something completely new and different. Push beyond your old limits, but don't take yourself too seriously in the process. Although you're often more lighthearted, you could be overly concerned now about getting everything just right. Relax your expectations so you can have fun, no matter what happens."
cancer,2011-10-10,"You are tempted to take on too much today and might feel discouraged later on, once you realize that you can't complete everything you started. Thankfully, the solution is rather simple: be more cautious prior to making a commitment. It's a good idea to begin a project slowly and pick up speed as you go along. It's always better to promise less and deliver more."
leo,2011-10-10,"You are ready to cook up a grandiose scheme with today's enterprising Aries Moon visiting your 9th House of Big Ideas. Luckily, courageous Mars in your fixed sign now gives you the unflappable determination to turn the craziest of your ideas into reality. If you recently scaled back a project, consider pushing it forward again until you can see progress."
virgo,2011-10-10,"You try to think of everything in advance, but no amount of detailed research can prepare you for the surprising twists and turns that your life is currently taking. However, don't get so caught up in the present moment or you'll forget about your original intention. Nevertheless, setting your old plans aside enables you to be even more effective in executing your new ones."
libra,2011-10-10,"Someone might catch you off guard by overreacting to what you say or do in a way that's hard to understand. But don't be negative today just because you are uncomfortable with anyone who takes an approach that is different from yours. Even if others seem brash, remember that you can be big enough to allow for the wide variety of people you encounter. Taking the high road now may be more beneficial than you expect."
scorpio,2011-10-10,"You might not have much patience today, yet your spontaneity is countered by your unrelenting drive to finish anything you start. It would be a mistake for anyone to think that you are all talk now, even if you have a lot to say. Back up your promises with decisive action that is focused on getting your work completed as quickly as possible."
sagittarius,2011-10-10,"You are in a high-frequency state of excitement, but some of your intensity is less than apparent. With Venus now in your 12th House of Secrets, there may be more going on than is stated in today's subject line. But your self-expression is irrepressible, spurring you to find ways to work off some of your excess energy. Hitting the gym or taking a long walk may be an ideal way to get your mojo flowing and things moving in the right direction."
capricorn,2011-10-10,"You could be a bit frustrated today because you don't feel like fighting to stay on top; however, you don't want to convince yourself to relax now, only to discover that you missed an important opportunity. The biggest challenge is in believing that things really could get easier from this point on. But whether or not the hardest part is over, you can set your life in a better direction by affirming your positive future in the present moment."
aquarius,2011-10-10,"You may have an idea about how you want to spend your day until someone crosses your path with an entirely different agenda. Your immediate reaction is to explain why your plan is the best course of action. However, you'll only create bigger problems if you set up a competitive situation where there will be only one winner. Establishing common ground enables everyone to work successfully together as a team."
pisces,2011-10-10,"You don't like it if anyone tells you what to do today, especially since your mind is already made up. Nevertheless, it's much better to avoid open conflict now and visualize what could be possible if everyone was more cooperative. However, you don't have to let others push you too far, especially if they're messing with your core values. Give them a fair warning and then take whatever action is required to maintain your integrity."
aries,2011-10-11,"The Full Moon in your fiery sign might agitate your anger if you feel blocked by someone who is exerting control over you. Your initial reaction is to just come on stronger and steamroll your way over anyone else's objections. Unfortunately, you could misjudge the severity of the situation. Don't waste your energy by creating more conflict. Back down, take a deep breath and seek common ground instead."
taurus,2011-10-11,"It's possible that job-related responsibilities have stacked up so high that you want to just run and hide. But burying your head in the sand will not help in the long run -- and it might not even alleviate the pressure in the present moment. Rather than trying to handle all your obligations at once, set priorities early in the day. Once you have a sensible plan, work steadily toward achieving your goals. If necessary, you can always pick up the slack tomorrow."
gemini,2011-10-11,"If your enthusiasm prompted you to go too far yesterday, you might need to make an apology, pull back on the reins and reconsider your next move before you make matters worse. Ironically, your optimism may not be dampened; it's just that your goals are intertwined with others and you cannot charge off on your own. There's no reason to be discouraged; regrouping before you push forward again will only increase your chances of success."
cancer,2011-10-11,"Domestic obligations may prevent you from rushing ahead with a new project at work as today's enterprising Aries Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Career. Even if you're uncharacteristically eager to head off on a different professional path, you'll first have to get the support from your closest friends and family -- and it may not be as forthcoming as you wish. Don't ignore your family responsibilities because your true security depends on having a strong foundation."
leo,2011-10-11,"Your mind is taking you on a wonderful adventure today as the uplifting Aries Full Moon shines in your 9th House of Faraway Places. Although your current vision may be grounded in reality, there's no shortcut to get from here to there. Face the facts and realize that you may have to manifest this dream the old-fashioned way with a concrete plan, hard work and patience."
virgo,2011-10-11,"Today's action-oriented Aries Full Moon brightens your 8th House of Shared Resources, encouraging you to collaborate with someone on your project in order to make the most of a current opportunity. Don't be concerned if you have to give up some control over the direction of your work or if you must share any potential rewards. What you can accomplish in partnership now will outshine what you could have done on your own."
libra,2011-10-11,"It's not easy to set aside your previous agenda and join forces with someone else today, even if a co-worker's plan sounds intriguing. The assertive Aries Full Moon activates your 7th House of Others, yet its tense opposition to the Sun and restrictive Saturn in your sign makes it difficult for you to be lured off track. Stop worrying about what might have been if you said yes; concentrate on accomplishing the goals you have already set for yourself, instead."
scorpio,2011-10-11,"A significant breakthrough in your daily routine can lead you to doing your work more efficiently than ever before. But the potential increase in productivity brought about by today's spontaneous Aries Full Moon in your 6th House of Habits may require you to move much slower than you prefer. Instead of jumping on the first good idea that comes along now, let your thoughts wander until you know that you have a winner."
sagittarius,2011-10-11,"Falling in love today is a real possibility with the ardent Aries Full Moon stimulating your 5th House of Romance and Self-Expression. But your current zest for life goes beyond an attraction to someone who excites your heart. Even if you want to pursue a relationship, a fascinating course of study, an intriguing idea or a new hobby, it's wise to take your time before turning your life upside down. You can always follow your bliss later when it's not so disruptive."
capricorn,2011-10-11,"You're eager for a blast of something new on the home front, but you may not have the time or energy to turn your plans into reality. The irrepressible Aries Full Moon in your 4th House of Security pushes you to tell your friends and family what you want. However, her opposition to dutiful Saturn in your 10th House of Public Responsibility means that you must satisfy your professional obligations first. Don't be distracted by a false sense of urgency; patience works in your favor this time around."
aquarius,2011-10-11,"You may be inclined to suddenly change your schedule today as the unstoppable Aries Full Moon lights up your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. But an unpremeditated shift in your agenda could stir up more than just a bit of excitement as unexpected consequences to your spontaneous behavior take on a life of their own. For now, the solution is easy: focus on your long-term goals and not on the present moment."
pisces,2011-10-11,"You could come up with original ways to make money today because the pioneering Aries Full Moon brightens your 2nd House of Income. But it's crucial to realize that your enthusiasm could make you believe that an idea is better than it actually will be in reality. Instead of going off on a wild goose chase, take the time to discuss your thoughts with someone you trust and listen carefully to the advice you are given."
aries,2011-10-12,"You may convince yourself that everything is fine in a relationship today. Although you probably realize complicated issues need resolution, you prefer to avoid the facts so you don't have to handle the current situation. It's a gift to see potential in others that's not yet manifested, but it's not a good idea to substitute your dreams for the truth. Pay attention to what's right in front of your nose before it's too late."
taurus,2011-10-12,"Intense emotions are springing forth from your subconscious today, but they might make you so uncomfortable that you choose to bury them. You want less complexity in your life, but your desires can be rather complicated now. Even if you believe that you are clearly expressing your passion, your intentions still may be misunderstood. Don't assume that someone else knows what you need. Be patient and take the time to confirm that your message has been accurately received."
gemini,2011-10-12,"Today is perfect for expressing your heart in an imaginative manner, but it might not be as good for getting a detailed message across as Mercury's trine to illusory Neptune muddles your communication. Your daydreams can be sweet as long as you don't think that your current thoughts are practical. Wait until mental clarity returns tomorrow before attempting to say something that has lasting significance."
cancer,2011-10-12,"You might wish that you could stay home and lose yourself in creative projects today, but the Moon in your 10th House of Public Responsibility is not very forgiving. Nevertheless, you're likely to spend time daydreaming about everything else you would rather be doing now. Unfortunately, fun and games may need to be postponed for a few days. Rather than fretting about what you cannot do, be thankful for what you can actually accomplish if you put your mind to it."
leo,2011-10-12,"You are lost in an idyllic dream about bringing a fantasy into reality as nebulous Neptune in your 7th House of Partners harmonizes with cerebral Mercury. However, once you open your eyes, your daily life may be overflowing with pressing responsibilities. Although you're tempted to linger in your imagination, it would be unwise to avoid the current situation. Bringing your attention back to reality can make a positive difference when you need it most."
virgo,2011-10-12,"It's hard to let go of your preconceived notions about what your day will bring, but it's crucial to move beyond your fantasies and finish your chores. Reality is elusive now because your ruling planet Mercury is working under the influence of dreamy Neptune. Let the most important decisions slide until tomorrow. Once the fog clears and your clarity returns, you will be able to choose more wisely."
libra,2011-10-12,"On this last day of thoughtful Mercury in Libra, you are carefully weighing and balancing your choices. You realize that it's important to finish up old business today, but you would rather enjoy yourself as Mercury activates dreamy Neptune in your 5th House of Fun and Games. The conflict between work and play might be aggravating, so seek out activities that calm you down. You can always catch up on your work tomorrow when you have a fresh perspective."
scorpio,2011-10-12,"You may feel trapped in a rut and are tempted to take a risk just to stir things up today. Unfortunately, changing your routine without a solid strategy could ultimately be more upsetting than exciting. Use your imagination to picture the ideal outcome and then create a plan to achieve your goals. Don't try to do it all in one day; you'll have a better chance tomorrow to fill in all the details."
sagittarius,2011-10-12,"You are focused on fulfilling your obligations today, but could be lured off course by your friends or co-workers. Their big ideas sound enticing to you, but grandiose plans are not likely grounded in reality. Don't believe everything you're told now; if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Nevertheless, it won't hurt to dream as long as you wait a couple of days before starting something new."
capricorn,2011-10-12,"You normally don't like feeling disoriented, and today's ethereal Mercury-Neptune trine could prompt you to waste too much time trying to re-establish your footing. Unfortunately, stability is elusive now, but the uncertainty could be beneficial if you allow yourself to question your assumptions about your career goals. There's no need to make any life-changing decision yet; answers will appear as early as tomorrow."
aquarius,2011-10-12,"Your dreams feel close enough to touch with idealistic Neptune in your sign harmonizing with trickster Mercury in your 9th House of Future Vision. But your ideas only seem sound until you actually try to make them tangible. Although it's wise to listen to your intuition, it's also crucial to rely on facts, not fantasies. Give yourself permission to meander through your imagination without any pressure. Floating in the symbolic realms today leads to more rational planning tomorrow."
pisces,2011-10-12,"You don't have much of a chance to be very logical today as your key planet Neptune lures you into Fantasyland. Common sense isn't your strong suit now, but you can play this to your advantage if you don't try to force any practical decisions. Even if you must perform your regular job duties, there's still time to drift off and contemplate the spiritual mysteries after your work is done."
aries,2011-10-13,"You are able to play a good game with active Mars in your 5th House of Spontaneity, but no matter how sure of yourself you are today, circumstances keep telling you to back off. Remember, everything seems more extreme than it actually is now, so temper your reactions with a bit of common sense. If you overplay your hand, you won't likely end up a winner."
taurus,2011-10-13,"You are inclined to initiate action today because you believe that such a good opportunity may not come around again soon. Nevertheless, you would be wise to be more cautious now, even if the signs are giving you a green light. The potential you see is probably real, but it might tempt you to overlook a critical fact. Don't be afraid of taking a risk as long as you first make sure that your assumptions are valid."
gemini,2011-10-13,"You are typically happy to agree with your friends, but you have your own agenda today and may not be willing to let it go. Unfortunately, you can take a great idea and expand it until it becomes so overblown that it's impractical. Establish goals that are within reach instead of trying to do too much. Keeping things simple will contribute to making the most of your day."
cancer,2011-10-13,"You are ready to begin a project that shifts your attention away from more serious concerns now. Luckily, you should be able to enjoy yourself with your friends, but a nagging sense of responsibility prevents you from being one hundred percent present. Nevertheless, a little time off will help to recharge your batteries, assuming that you're willing to return and face the challenging issues you left behind."
leo,2011-10-13,"It's natural for you Lions to act quickly on your feelings, especially if they are supported by your logic. But your emotions may be unexplainable now, giving you second thoughts about your current plan. You might become frustrated as you realize that the path to happiness is not as straightforward as you prefer. Don't ignore your conflicting desires; observe the impossibility of your current dilemma without attempting to force resolution yet. Luckily, the Sun will come out tomorrow."
virgo,2011-10-13,"The more you ignore your feelings today, the more power they gain. You may try to distract yourself by creating grandiose schemes that are so impractical they're of little consequence. However, remembering to balance your dreams with the reality of your current situation could be all that's needed to prevent you from running off in the wrong direction."
libra,2011-10-13,"It's easy to keep things real today because the Sun-Saturn conjunction in your sign won't let you deviate too far from your responsibilities, even if you dream of having more freedom. No one will be able to pull you off track as rational Mercury joins your ruling planet Venus in your 2nd House of Core Beliefs. But you may be so obsessed with adhering to your principles now that you could miss an amazing opportunity right in front of your nose. A little bit of flexibility will help your cause."
scorpio,2011-10-13,"You feel as if you're in your element today with Mercury and Venus in your emotional sign. You could gain more recognition now, but ironically might choose to step onto the sidelines as the Sun joins austere Saturn in your 12th House of Privacy. Don't withdraw too soon. If you have someone else's attention, take advantage of the moment and make your point succinctly before retreating into the shadows."
sagittarius,2011-10-13,"You may be very eloquent now as masterful metaphors and cutting criticisms roll off your tongue, but you might not be aware that your words could hurt someone who has thinner skin than yours. Unfortunately, your self-confidence could be perceived by others as a false sense of authority, causing them to pull away from you. You would do better by saving your pedantic preaching for another day. There's no need to increase everyone's stress levels by claiming that you have the only corner on the truth."
capricorn,2011-10-13,"Your key planet Saturn conjuncts the Sun in your 10th House of Career today, heightening your sense of ambition to a point that could be difficult for others to take. You may think that you're being straightforward as you talk about your goals, but it might appear as if you're trying to prove that you're better than everyone else. Acting with so much authority could make you hard to be around. Cooperation is a much more reliable path to success, so don't forget to share the spotlight."
aquarius,2011-10-13,"You don't appreciate anyone pushing you around and you could be ready to push back in order to hold your position. Although your overall positive attitude helps you to defend your perspective, self-doubt sneaks in today to make it more challenging. Be sure that you're clear about your opinions before you say anything now. It's an illusion to think that you have to prove your superiority, so it may be smarter to just walk away from an argument until the energy settles down."
pisces,2011-10-13,"It's tricky to manage your affairs today because you want to remain grounded while simultaneously staying open to the opportunities around you. At first it seems impossible to entertain the possibilities while also handling your current responsibilities. Fortunately, you can make these divergent paths work in your favor if you are sufficiently motivated to finish your work quickly so you can have time to roam around in your imagination."
aries,2011-10-14,"You aren't quite ready to party because of too many lingering responsibilities, but you cannot help fantasizing about all the pleasures you would rather be experiencing today. Unfortunately, your daydreams could get in the way of what you need to accomplish. Keep in mind that you won't really be able to enjoy yourself if your mind is on work, so you might as well stay focused and have fun later."
taurus,2011-10-14,"You may be driven by your desires today or, on the other extreme, you could just feel plain lazy. Either way, with luxurious Venus opposing indulgent Jupiter, you might grow stubborn if you believe you know an easier way to get a job done. Even if you see the benefits of someone else's plan, you prefer to do things your way now. However, you would be wise to acquiesce on trivial matters and save your resistance for something that's more important."
gemini,2011-10-14,"You could make a big show of supporting a co-worker's plan while hiding your real concerns from everyone else because you don't want to be perceived as being the negative one. The truth is that you keep changing your mind now, making you unsure of what you really think. Be careful, for others will see through your performance if you're overly dramatic. Ultimately, your best strategy is to stay under the radar today, without bringing unnecessary attention to your position."
cancer,2011-10-14,"You might be overly effusive today when expressing your feelings to someone you really like. Naturally, you'll need to feel safe enough to go out on a limb, but optimistic Jupiter in your social 11th house will give you the necessary boost of confidence. Unfortunately, your words could betray your message if they are misinterpreted. Being direct and to the point should minimize the possibility of any misunderstanding."
leo,2011-10-14,"You may receive professional recognition today or, at least, acknowledgment for a job well done. Ironically, rather than feeling good about your accomplishment, you could waste energy worrying about whether or not you really deserve the positive feedback. Self-doubt will only sap your productivity; graciously accept the support you receive from others now and save your questioning for another day."
virgo,2011-10-14,"You are willing to turn on the charm and play the game today if you think that it will get you what you want. But your self-confidence can lead to trouble, prompting you to say more than is necessary as loquacious Mercury aspects irrepressible Uranus. Unfortunately, your message can become muddled and your desires left unsatisfied unless you maintain a clear and logical approach in your interactions with others."
libra,2011-10-14,"Keep your money in your pocket today because your extravagant taste can land you in financial trouble if you see something that you think you must have. With opulent Jupiter opposing stylish Venus in your 2nd House of Possessions, your eye for beauty is keen now. Unfortunately, you may not take the time to consider the true value of what you're buying. Think about what you really need rather than what you want in the spur of the moment."
scorpio,2011-10-14,"It's tempting to look at the sunny side of a partnership today, even if long shadows are cast by emotional baggage. Joyful Jupiter in your 7th House of Relationships encourages you to shine your light so brightly that the shadows disappear along with your negativity. However, the underlying issues -- even if they aren't visible -- can continue to feed the tension. Find the courage to face the dark; it's not as scary as you think."
sagittarius,2011-10-14,"You might feel like partying today and believe that you're willing to pay the price for skipping out on your responsibilities. After all, you might reason that you can always finish up your work later. Unfortunately, you've probably left too much until the last minute already, making it tough to justify an early exit from work. The potential for fun won't disappear as fast as you think; slow down and do the right thing because you'll be able to enjoy yourself even more later on without any guilt."
capricorn,2011-10-14,"Sweet Venus' presence in your social 11th house indicates that your friends can bring you great pleasure now if you're willing to let go of your own agenda. You may secretly imagine that you are running the show, but these unexpressed wishes shouldn't impede your fun today. Letting your peers take the lead will work in your favor as long as you don't give all of your power away. Take full responsibility for knowing when to say no."
aquarius,2011-10-14,"Receiving praise on the job or from someone in your community can instill you with confidence, but positive feedback won't be enough unless you also are fulfilled by what you do. Take time to think about your long-term goals and set yourself back on track if you have lost your way. Rewards that aren't meaningful to you won't necessarily add to the quality of your life or make you any happier. Following your bliss is your best route to success."
pisces,2011-10-14,"Nagging responsibilities are enough to put you in a bad mood; however, adding a fun activity to your calendar should make you feel better for a while. You are coming to the end of a very busy week and it only seems right that you should take time to relax and enjoy the pleasures of life. Just don't go overboard; a bit of moderation will enable you to sustain the good times throughout the weekend."
aries,2011-10-15,"Although your day starts off quietly enough, the pace picks up unexpectedly and you can't help but enjoy the buzz. You might have lacked motivation before, but now ideas race through your mind, making it difficult to decide which ones are actually worth pursuing. It's great when you feel this enthusiastic, but it may be smarter to slow down and finish one project before you rush off to the next one."
taurus,2011-10-15,"You can be so stubborn sometimes that you drive your friends and associates crazy. However, today you may be sharing good ideas faster than others can assimilate them. The Moon's shift into clever Gemini isn't the whole story because your key planet Venus is being zapped by brilliant Uranus. Freely express whatever comes into your mind, but also do your best to follow through with your commitments."
gemini,2011-10-15,"The Moon's return to your lighthearted sign can lift your spirits today, but she also can bring a feeling of restlessness. Your moods change rapidly now, soaring and sinking, and soaring again. Others may not be able to get a clear read on you, for each time they think they know what you're thinking, your attitude shifts. Don't worry about anyone else's expectations; just observe your emotions and let them continue to run their natural course."
cancer,2011-10-15,"It's difficult for you to keep secrets today, even if you're usually good at maintaining boundaries. It isn't that you're eager to stir up uncomfortable feelings in others or betray anyone's trust; it's just that you find it hard to hold back now if you feel close to someone. However, an improper disclosure won't improve a relationship and could, in the long run, jeopardize what you already established with a trusted friend. Stay conscious of every word you say so that you don't accidentally break your promise of silence."
leo,2011-10-15,"You may be feeling emotionally open today, but you still might think you need to be careful and protect yourself if your defenses begin to fall. Others will likely see the shift in your behavior if you are genuine and they, in turn, will be more attentive to you. Don't retreat; give yourself permission to bask in the admiration, even if it makes you feel vulnerable. It's healing for you to let your love light shine."
virgo,2011-10-15,"You may be the one that others come to in order to get results because you are normally very focused. However, today you could be more scattered, making it harder to live up to everyone's demands. Don't worry if you can't do everything. Just concentrate on attacking the most important chores, leaving the other tasks to complete when you have the time."
libra,2011-10-15,"Although you want everything to be in perfect balance, you may need to assert yourself more aggressively than you prefer today. Your discomfort increases when you think about what you must do, but fortunately you should be able to rise to the task. The clever Gemini Moon in your 9th House of Future Vision enables you to talk your way through your own resistance. You might even surprise yourself with how easily you handle a difficult situation."
scorpio,2011-10-15,"You feel as if things are going well today as long as you stay in motion. Maintaining a high level of activity is a key to your current success; however, conflicting thoughts distract you from being in the moment as soon as you start to slow down. Unfortunately, your busyness actually prevents you from hearing your own thoughts. Although it might hinder your productivity for a while, stopping long enough to reconnect with your subconscious will be healthier in the long run."
sagittarius,2011-10-15,"You might believe that your friends are moving much faster than you are today, yet you're not interested in trying to catch up with them now. Unfortunately, you can't just take yourself out of the game and let everyone play without you. The best solution to your current dilemma stems from just sharing your truth. Tell everyone why you want to go a little slower today and then listen to what they say. An honest give-and-take dialogue should carry you to common ground where you all can get along with respect."
capricorn,2011-10-15,"Your workmates seem to be missing the point today and you see no easy way to make them understand the truth. Unfortunately, you cannot go out of your way to set others straight because they'll just think that you're being pushy. But if you don't say anything at all, they might not even realize that there's more to your story. Instead of attempting to change anyone's mind, just gently share your perspective and then let everyone else form his or her own opinion."
aquarius,2011-10-15,"You may feel more playful now, yet your commitments won't allow you to drop everything to follow your whimsical desires. But don't complain about your current obligations, for that's just a waste of your time and energy. Instead, resign yourself to meeting your current responsibilities as best you can. You will still have the chance to do something that makes you smile later on."
pisces,2011-10-15,"A family dilemma may require your immediate attention now that the Moon is visiting your 4th House of Domestic Matters. You can see both sides of a complex issue, bringing uncertainty about which solution is the best one. Your smartest strategy would be to hold off making significant decisions until your clarity begins to return later in the day. Don't let anyone coerce you into choosing a course of action until you know that you're ready."
aries,2011-10-16,"You are given another chance to learn your lesson today, but you would be wise to get it right this time because you may not be able to avoid the consequences of your current deeds. However, it isn't just about your behavior; you're being judged now on the value of your ideas, too. If you are serious about communicating your position, you could earn an opportunity to put your words into action."
taurus,2011-10-16,"You are taking your responsibilities quite seriously today, yet you still might be challenged to complete a project that you have already started. You're easily distracted now by shiny objects or intriguing ideas, yet you're better off if you stick to your work, even if it feels ordinary and boring. Thankfully, your concentrated effort should bring the positive acknowledgment you seek if your actions are aligned with your intentions."
gemini,2011-10-16,"You could easily waste time spinning your wheels today without getting very much accomplished. However, you can increase your efficiency by simply reconsidering your schedule and prioritizing your tasks. Taking yourself seriously might be sufficient cause to sit down and actually make a list of what you need to do. Normally, you might lack the patience for this kind of approach, but making plans ahead of time now will be worth the effort."
cancer,2011-10-16,"No matter how much time you put into organizing your day, it won't likely unfold according to your plan. Mental Mercury's sextile with powerful Pluto in your 7th House of Others can bring a domineering person into your life now that isn't shy about running the show. Although you might choose to set your needs aside for a while, don't be so quick to say yes to someone else. Give yourself the benefit of the doubt and make your own dreams come true first."
leo,2011-10-16,"You might be wise today to consider any lingering issues of self-esteem. You Lions are usually seen as proud creatures who on occasion overstep your regular bounds to roar about your confidence, but the tables may be turned now. However, there's no need to worry about the outcome of a current situation that is still up in the air. Do whatever you can to make things work before letting go of your attachment to what happens."
virgo,2011-10-16,"Your key planet Mercury aligns with passionate Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression today, infusing you with strong feelings that fuel your creative process. Even if you're feeling optimistic, you could be fighting an uphill battle against serious circumstances. Nevertheless, you can surprise others now, and even yourself, with a more spontaneous approach to life. Don't try to change everything overnight; give yourself a few days to loosen your grip on the reins of control."
libra,2011-10-16,"You may be able to live up to other people's expectations today, but you'll need to ignore your own desires in the process. However, your closest friends and family can't help but wonder if you're hiding something. Thankfully, you're still able to lighten up the mood and display a more playful side of your nature. Just don't get sidetracked by your need to prove yourself to anyone else or you won't be able to fully enjoy your day."
scorpio,2011-10-16,"You can literally feel the power of your beliefs today as the Sun and Mercury align with unrelenting Pluto in your 3rd House of Communication, adding intensity to your words. Ironically, exercising self-restraint brings even more strength to your message. Nevertheless, don't expect too much too fast; everything will continue to improve if you let it do so at its own pace."
sagittarius,2011-10-16,"You're eager to be distracted from your chores by someone else's agenda today, yet you can't just walk away from your previous promises. Even though you are usually the one who seeks out adventure, your friends might be the ones with all the good ideas now. Naturally, you want to play with them, but it may be wiser to set boundaries and keep yourself on course to your destination. Believe it or not, achieving your goals sometimes is more important than having fun."
capricorn,2011-10-16,"Witty Mercury aligns with transformative Pluto in your sign today, empowering you to say things that can have a positive impact on others. Mercury allows you to engage in a stimulating discussion now, without having to win the debate or even trying to convince anyone that your perspective is valid. Instead of attempting to prove anyone wrong, look for ways to make everyone right. Your open-minded outlook is a great example for others to follow."
aquarius,2011-10-16,You're able to cleverly turn a sobering conversation into one of hope and inspiration today. What starts out feeling like a setback with a friend or partner can become powerful grist for your mill. You were looking for something significant to chew on and now it's here. Don't give up too easily; it's going to take plenty of time for your special magic to work.
pisces,2011-10-16,"An easygoing friendship could become more frustrating today if there is disagreement about the fundamental nature of reality. Oddly enough, you can both experience the same events while forming very different perspectives. Instead of trying to establish who is right, just put your assumptions and conclusions out on the table. Establishing common ground is all that's needed to lighten up the energy for everyone involved."
aries,2011-10-17,"Someone may have to tell you that you're shouting before you even notice that you have raised your voice. Your enthusiasm can be out of control today, encouraging you to turn the simplest idea into one that's so overblown your credibility suffers. Thankfully, a little self-awareness goes a long way now and you don't have to unconsciously make things more important than they actually are. When your excitement rises, take a few deep breaths and remember to tone down your message."
taurus,2011-10-17,"Mercury in passionate Scorpio is visiting your 7th House of Partners, potentially bringing people into your life now who are not willing to negotiate. You could overreact with your own stubbornness if others try to override your decisions. It's easy for a little disagreement to escalate out of control unless you're willing to go out of your way to be flexible. Take the high road and let tempers settle before you resume discussions."
gemini,2011-10-17,"You might want to exert more self-restraint than you actually have today. It's not that you are worried about getting too worked up over something that's important to you. Instead, you're more concerned with honoring someone else's privacy. The Moon in your sign encourages you to express your feelings, but telling the whole truth may not be appropriate. Some things are better kept quiet, so be discreet about what isn't yours to share."
cancer,2011-10-17,You are often the person your friends and associates confide in because they can usually count on your willingness to listen. But you may be more eager to talk about your own feelings now than reflect on everyone else's. It's okay to have your own ambitions and it's natural to want to share them. Just remember to keep your enthusiasm in check or you might say more than you want.
leo,2011-10-17,"You wish you could reminisce about an event from your past now that Mercury is visiting your 4th House of Origins. But it's more complicated than simply telling your story, for you may feel the need to exaggerate and turn your memories into a melodrama. However, your motives for sharing may not be apparent, which could prompt others to withdraw in uncertainty. If someone pulls back today, let them go and tell your tale another day."
virgo,2011-10-17,"Your ruling planet Mercury opposes excessive Jupiter today, spinning your thoughts out of control. It's not that your logic ever needs external supervision; it's just that you could be receiving encouragement now every way you turn. Nevertheless, don't blame anyone else for your radical behavior. Just re-establish your boundaries while honoring everyone else's, too."
libra,2011-10-17,"You may feel a bit panicky today when you realize how much you have to do this week. You might even have a twinge of regret if you took too much time off this weekend to play. But the illusion that time is running out is exacerbated by the restless Gemini Moon, and worrying won't help you get back on track. Instead, take a deep breath, roll up your sleeves and get to work."
scorpio,2011-10-17,"You just want everyone to recognize your contributions and appreciate your efforts beyond the call of duty. Unfortunately, expecting too much from others can make satisfaction even more elusive. Unrealistic demands won't make anyone feel better, nor will allowing yourself to be talked into agreeing with something that's not in your best interest. No one else can decide what's right for you, so listen carefully to your intuition and follow your heart."
sagittarius,2011-10-17,"Your ruling planet Jupiter symbolizes visionary thinking while Mercury rules your rational thought process. Today, as Mercury opposes Jupiter you could grow overly concerned with determining how you make decisions, yet this obsession won't necessarily help you choose the right course of action. Keep in mind that you don't have to prove your analytical superiority to anyone. Just focus the best you can and push ahead methodically on your goals."
capricorn,2011-10-17,"It's been said that you mountain-climbing Goats get ahead because of your sure-footedness, but today your unflappable determination could be your secret ingredient to success. You may be surprised by how quickly others will give up, especially if they see an easier path to follow. But even as alternative routes appear, keep your eyes focused singularly on your destination and don't deviate from your course."
aquarius,2011-10-17,"Red-hot Mars is firing up your key planet Uranus today, making it nearly impossible to hide your dissatisfaction with the status quo, especially in a relationship at work. Someone could anger you now by taking undue credit or simply needing too much attention. You're not interested in feeding anyone's ego; you just want to get the job done the best way possible."
pisces,2011-10-17,"You may be extra chatty today with talkative Mercury in your 9th House of Big Ideas opposing giant Jupiter in your 3rd House of Communication. Unfortunately, once you start explaining your perspective, you might not know when to shut up. Keep in mind that your thinking is anything but objective now. Don't be afraid to keep your involvement in a project to a minimum or, if possible, just say no. Being brutally honest is kinder than disappointing others later on."
aries,2011-10-18,"You might think that remaining quiet is a sensible strategy today, but you won't likely avoid conflict by relying on defensive maneuvers. It's tempting to believe that you'll keep your feelings to yourself, but unexpressed emotions have a way of hijacking your day. It's no fun to lose your temper, so get your concerns out into the open instead of naively assuming that things will improve on their own."
taurus,2011-10-18,"Communicating with others seems so easy today that you may think that you're missing something. Unfortunately, you are probably glossing over a critical fact or conveniently forgetting what you were told. Thankfully, you can choose to focus extra attention on the details of your interactions. The simple act of concentrating on the present moment, instead of letting your mind wander, can help prevent an unnecessary misunderstanding."
gemini,2011-10-18,"Your ruling planet Mercury is wired by electric Uranus today, exciting your nervous system and lifting your spirits. Unconventional ideas can be distracting because they aren't necessarily practical, and you may not be interested in applying your creativity now because you don't want to slow down your unrestrained thinking process. Although facing the limitations of your current circumstances might not sound great at first, putting your feet back on the ground will make you feel better in the long run."
cancer,2011-10-18,"You would like to talk about your feelings now that the Moon is back in your sign, even if you're also feeling a bit shy. Nevertheless, you won't likely go out of your way to bring up an issue that could provoke someone to withdraw from you. However, once you understand that your fear of abandonment can precipitate exactly what you're trying to avoid, it will be easier to acknowledge the intense emotions that are being revealed at this time."
leo,2011-10-18,"Don't trust others who promise you the world because they may not be telling you the whole story now that the Moon is in your secretive 12th house. It might be wiser for you to take care of business as if you were on your own today, even if someone offers to help you. Nevertheless, it's safe to listen to those who are supportive of your cause, even if they don't have easy answers. Ultimately, having faith in yourself is your best strategy."
virgo,2011-10-18,"Your key planet Mercury connects with brilliant Uranus today, sparking your imagination with unconventional thoughts and intense desires. However, you might play your hand tentatively because you don't want to upset your friends or destabilize an existing relationship. Still, it may be impossible to avoid a confrontation if someone oversteps your boundaries. Do whatever you must do in order to protect your territory as long as you don't intentionally hurt anyone else in the process."
libra,2011-10-18,"Your need to nurture others at work can make you feel indispensable today with the Moon's presence in your 10th House of Public Responsibility. However, meddling in other people's affairs can also create a real mess if you go too far. Don't fall into the trap of believing that no one can get along without your assistance now. It's healthier to wait until someone asks you for help before jumping in and taking over."
scorpio,2011-10-18,"You are tenaciously holding on to a fascinating idea today, even if it isn't very practical. You may not have time now to seriously develop your plan, yet you still can derive pleasure from just thinking about the possibilities. Keep in mind that you could turn a rather simple desire into such a big deal that the original thought is lost. Give yourself permission to dream, but don't lose perspective on what's real and what's not."
sagittarius,2011-10-18,"Mischievous Mercury can trick you into thinking that your new idea is a brilliant one, but you should probably keep your thoughts to yourself today until you decide how much to share with others. You could spoil your chances for success by telling someone about your plan before the details are actually in place. Although you often can get away with developing your strategy on the fly, being more cautious now works in your favor."
capricorn,2011-10-18,"You are usually more self-restrained than others in your group, but today all bets are off. It's not that your energy is out of control now; it's just that you are aligned with a higher purpose, adding intensity to your words and actions. Thankfully, your friends and co-workers are eager to listen to you unfold your strategy, so tell them exactly what you're thinking, even if you aren't sure how all the pieces will ultimately fit together."
aquarius,2011-10-18,"You aren't very comfortable when so many images and ideas are swirling around in your brain that you don't know what to do next. Mercury's alignment with your key planet Uranus can amuse you with all the possibilities, but you still grow dizzy watching the mental fireworks. Instead of passively dreaming about your future, concentrate your attention on a single goal and maintain your focus until it is within reach."
pisces,2011-10-18,"Although you may appear quietly confident today, you might not have that much to say yet. You're riding a wave of creativity with the Moon visiting your 5th House of Self-Expression, but the real action is taking place within your mind and out of sight from everyone's watchful gaze. Don't feel obliged to prove your brilliance to anyone now; just gently express what's most important to you once you're comfortable with the results of your inner process."
aries,2011-10-19,"Taking a walk down Memory Lane might sound like a good idea at first, but it could turn into a dead-end street before you know it. Recollections of your childhood are uplifting until you remember something that also brings up hurt feelings. If you become stuck on anger or resentment, the best way to move forward now is to shake off the past by doing something that requires one hundred percent of your concentration. You'll feel better once you get some work done."
taurus,2011-10-19,"If someone at work makes unreasonable demands on your time today, you might attempt a strategy of passive resistance. You aren't interested in wasting your energy arguing with others to explain why you believe they are out of line. Instead, you give them a display of your infamous bullheadedness because you believe that actions will speak louder than words. Nevertheless, they'll never correct their errant ways unless you take the time to tell them exactly what you're thinking."
gemini,2011-10-19,"You're often the one who can make a spur-of-the-moment decision to spend money on something that you want. However, you're more serious now about your financial condition with the retentive Cancer Moon visiting your 2nd House of Possessions. It may be a good idea to say no to discretionary purchases now, but don't take your frugality so far that you pass up a really smart deal or a great opportunity."
cancer,2011-10-19,"Although you have important domestic responsibilities that shouldn't be avoided, you still might want to take some time for yourself today. Fortunately, you may be able to postpone your personal business, but don't try to avoid it entirely. Let those involved know about any change in your schedule so no ill will is unnecessarily created. Just make sure to fulfill your obligations as promised."
leo,2011-10-19,"The spotlight may continue to shine on you as action-hero Mars travels through your performance-oriented sign. But now the self-protective Cancer Moon hiding out in your 12th House of Escapism could have you looking for the nearest exit. Although you normally love being on stage, today you crave some privacy. Don't set your expectations too high because the show may need to go on, whether or not your heart is in it."
virgo,2011-10-19,"You don't want to disappoint your workmates, but they may be expecting so much from you these days that you begin to worry. However, a bit of self-doubt can be therapeutic if it motivates you to do your research and be more prepared for your job. But too much fear of failure can become problematic if it prevents you from doing anything at all. Keep in mind that you are your own biggest critic and it's harder to satisfy yourself than anyone else."
libra,2011-10-19,"You may be more responsive to your co-workers now than you are to a friend or lover, setting the stage for a relationship meltdown. The Moon's visit to your 10th House of Career reflects your current need to be successful on the job, but you could be so eager to succeed that you end up paying a larger emotional price than you bargained for. Thankfully, remaining aware of your ambitions allows you to step back and find your center before you really lose your balance."
scorpio,2011-10-19,"You may feel painfully restrained today by the same set of circumstances and responsibilities that seemed just fine yesterday. Part of your current problem is the strong wanderlust you are feeling now that the Moon is visiting your 9th House of Travel and Education. Keep in mind that you'll probably be just as content to learn about an exotic destination as if you were actually going there. A journey of the mind may be better than getting on an airplane now, anyway."
sagittarius,2011-10-19,Your interactions with others can take on an air of intensity now that the Moon is traveling through your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You aren't as interested in clever conversations that explore the far reaches of the cosmos as you are in getting to the bottom of your feelings. You don't just want emotional clarity today; you want to create magic with someone special that turns an ordinary day into one that you'll remember for a long time to come.
capricorn,2011-10-19,"Even a casual relationship may seem overly emotional today with the sensitive Cancer Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others. You might be expressing more feelings now without even realizing that your openness increases your vulnerability. Unfortunately, your fear of losing control can be triggered if you're pulled off track by an intense interaction. Rather than shutting yourself off from your heart, see what you can learn by exploring unfamiliar ground."
aquarius,2011-10-19,"The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Routine encourages you to set aside your emotional needs so you can better focus on the mechanical aspects of your everyday life. Unfortunately, turning off your emotions isn't really a sensible strategy because they won't just go away on their own. Push back against your discomfort by putting your feelings out into the open, even if they don't seem to fit. You might be surprised to find out that others feel the same way."
pisces,2011-10-19,"Expressing your needs to someone you trust can deepen a current friendship or set the stage for a new romance as the Moon moves through your 5th House of Love and Romance. Don't shy away from displaying tenderness because you'll feel good when you're taking care of someone you love. Still, it's healthy to keep a clear perspective on your emotions or you could become more attached than you realize."
aries,2011-10-20,"You may have an excess of physical energy today, but you could squander your reserves if you aren't careful. Wasting your time on something unimportant can be draining, but fortunately it won't likely have a lasting negative impact. Nevertheless, you would be wise to work smarter rather than harder in order to maximize the opportunities that come your way."
taurus,2011-10-20,"You may not fully understand all the dynamics that are impacting your family relationships today as the Moon enters your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. However, you can feel the tension increasing so you know something is brewing. Don't get discouraged by your lack of direction. Maintaining your established course could be difficult now, yet being patient is still your best strategy until clarity returns."
gemini,2011-10-20,"You might be so distracted by the array of tasks you need to complete today that you can't figure out where to begin. It seems that as soon as you make a specific plan, something happens that requires you to reconsider your previous choice. Frustration can set in when certainty is replaced by self-doubt again and again. You could believe that an absolute answer will solve everything now, but if possible, it's smarter to hold off making a final decision until next week."
cancer,2011-10-20,"The Moon enters your 2nd House of Personal Resources today, encouraging you to pay attention to managing what you currently have, rather than trying to accumulate more. Although it's time to build on what you have already started, muddled motives could detract from your efficiency now. Don't bother attempting to justify your actions because your explanations will just grow increasingly convoluted. Keep things as simple as you can and try to finish whatever you begin."
leo,2011-10-20,"Everyone seems to believe that your feelings are transparent today as the Moon returns to your sign. However, chances are that no one truly knows what you need, even if others try to convince you that they do. Unfortunately, your emotions can get in the way of your words, so you might not be very effective when you try to explain what you want. Tone down your expectations and practice flexibility; asking for less could actually bring you more than you think."
virgo,2011-10-20,"The Moon squares extroverted Jupiter today from your 12th House of Secrets, creating a stress between your desire to connect with others and your need to be alone. It's challenging to share exactly what you want now because even the act of communicating conflicts with your reclusive yearnings. Instead of trying to change the current situation, just observe your emotional reactions to what's happening. Living with the paradox for a few days builds character and won't be as difficult as it sounds."
libra,2011-10-20,"You have wonderful friends who are eager to play with you today. However, you may grow annoyed with others if they are too distracting because you have responsibilities to fulfill. Don't take yourself so seriously now; no one will fault you for taking some time to enjoy yourself as long as you return to your obligations later in the day."
scorpio,2011-10-20,"Your planet Pluto falls under the beautiful spell of alluring Venus today, attracting you to the idea of experiencing sensual pleasure. Nevertheless, your thoughts -- however exquisite they may be -- are not grounded in experience now, so it's not wise to act on these current desires. Don't expect someone out of the blue to deliver your fantasies. Just enjoy your dreams for what they are, without needing to make them real."
sagittarius,2011-10-20,"You have been contemplating the big picture lately -- something you do quite well -- yet now it's time to put your grand plan into motion. Fortunately, courageous Mars and the Moon are both visiting your adventurous 9th house today, motivating you to accomplish your goals. You are in a dynamic period of growth, so don't wait for a better time to initiate action."
capricorn,2011-10-20,"Powerful Pluto in your 1st House of Personality receives a nod of approval from valuable Venus today, encouraging you to pursue pleasure or material wealth. You may not understand the intensity of your current ambition, but this is not the time for analysis. Push steadily toward your goals because you have the necessary inner resolve to overcome most obstacles now. Set your mind on your destination and then don't let anything or anyone distract you."
aquarius,2011-10-20,"A close friend or ally may appear to turn against you today as the fiery Leo Moon marches into your 7th House of Others. Even a casual conversation could become argumentative now because combative Mars is stirring up trouble in this relationship house. Fortunately, you should be able to avoid a conflict if you remember that diplomacy is smarter than outright conflict. Negotiating a peaceful solution is better than trying to sidestep the subject, even if it's uncomfortable at first."
pisces,2011-10-20,"Although you could face a confrontation at work today, you might not be able to get to the source of the squabble. Your interactions with coworkers aren't as simple as they seem on the surface, for unspoken feelings can make communication awkward. Thankfully, you can reduce the emotional charge on an unpleasant situation by taking the higher road and considering the larger picture, instead of only focusing on what's in it for you."
aries,2011-10-21,"The Moon-Mars conjunction heats up your 5th House of Fun and Games and encourages you to express your inner child. You're eager to participate in enjoyable activities today, especially ones that allow you to display your emotional warmth to someone you love. Nevertheless, you may think that everything is perfect if you continue to avoid the truth. Your current state of grace won't last forever, so face the facts while your creative powers are still strong."
taurus,2011-10-21,"Your idealistic attitude at work today can gain you extra points from your boss. Although others might hold you in high regard now, they may not be able to see the real you. Don't add to the confusion by diffusing your message with too many words because the more you talk, the greater your chances of contradicting yourself. Instead, let your actions speak for you to make the best impression."
gemini,2011-10-21,"Although everything is busier today with the Moon and Mars joining in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, you still may be able to float through the day without feeling much stress. Your daydreams are so real now that, like Cinderella, you can turn a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage in your mind. Very little can get in your way, but your sense of perspective may be a bit warped. Don't be afraid of your fantasies; just remember that they can influence your objectivity."
cancer,2011-10-21,"You may actually believe that you have established equilibrium in your family life, but the hidden complexity can catch you off guard today. Your immediate reaction to an unexpected turn of events could be so intense that it's more surprising than what actually happened. Think twice before allowing a rush of adrenaline to determine your future. Sit with any decisions you make now before acting on them in an impulsive burst of energy."
leo,2011-10-21,"You might feel as if your life is taking off now that the Moon conjuncts impetuous Mars in your 1st House of Self. Thankfully, your physical energy level is high, enabling you to pick up the pace of your walk, put an extra bounce into your words and appear happier than before. Just be careful not to lose perspective because ignoring the facts can stir up resistance from others. You can maintain a positive attitude without going overboard."
virgo,2011-10-21,"You often like to work behind the scenes, and today's Moon-Mars conjunction in your 12th House of Secrets can push you even deeper into your inner world. Your reaction to someone's evasive behavior can be so strong that you don't even know how to put it into words. But bottled up feelings can have negative consequences, so fight against your current tendency to withdraw emotionally and let others know what you're experiencing as gently as possible."
libra,2011-10-21,"Your fantasy life is more active than usual as the Sun in your artistic sign harmonizes with ethereal Neptune in your 5th House of Creativity. Although you can be productive if you put your mind to it, you're more likely to pursue social activities today. Thankfully, relaxing with your friends can be very beneficial now, setting the stage for an efficient workday tomorrow when you can make up for lost time."
scorpio,2011-10-21,"This can be a powerfully productive day as the Moon joins superhero Mars in your 10th House of Career. You are at the top of your professional game and have abundant energy to apply yourself toward your job. Nevertheless, you still need to convince yourself that it's okay to work for your own success, rather than only doing as you're told. Make your dreams come true instead of just giving in to other people's expectations."
sagittarius,2011-10-21,"Getting together with a group of coworkers or kicking back with a few friends might be the best thing you can do for yourself today. You may have big career plans but pushing toward your goals is frustrating if you don't make as much progress as you want. However, it's not wise to let go of your dreams, even if they take additional time to manifest. Ironically, easing off on the gas pedal now could be the catalyst that refuels your forward movement."
capricorn,2011-10-21,"You may be very unrealistic about your potential at work because today's Sun-Neptune trine emboldens you to believe nearly anything now. Although you're able to see far beyond the present moment, it's challenging to separate your fantasies from what's real. If you have specific goals, make certain that you're giving yourself enough time to deliver on your current promises. You won't be happy if you just daydream about your future without taking concrete action."
aquarius,2011-10-21,"You may be involved with others in ways that pull you into new territory as the Moon joins forceful Mars in your 7th House of Companions. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know how assertive you need to be in order to get the ball rolling. On the other hand, you might choose to withdraw if someone else acts too aggressively. Ultimately, following your intuition is the best strategy. Pay attention to your dreams; they won't steer you wrong now."
pisces,2011-10-21,"You may try to keep your feelings to yourself today, but it's so easy to get caught up in office politics or sucked into someone else's melodrama. Your sensitivity is high, so you are more sympathetic to others than you realize. Nevertheless, it's still possible to be compassionate without losing your perspective. One way to maintain balance is to concentrate on your work now so there's not much energy left over for wandering into uncertain emotional territory."
aries,2011-10-22,"It doesn't matter that you want to do something crazy today that goes against everyone's expectations; you have obligations that take precedence over your urge to escape. Instead of kicking back now, you would be better off putting your shoulder to the wheel and focusing on work. Whether you have job-related projects or domestic chores, don't postpone them any longer. Your unwavering sense of purpose will reward you with the privilege of being able to take time off once you are finished."
taurus,2011-10-22,"You can turn challenging work into fun today, because you have enough sense to make the best of any situation. You may be so clever and cunning in your approach that your coworkers actually believe that you're enjoying yourself and offer to pitch in and help. But you're no Tom Sawyer because you'll paint the fence or do nearly any other job now even if no one else shows up. A job well done brings you real satisfaction all by itself."
gemini,2011-10-22,"You might stuff more into your day than you can manage, but that won't keep you from trying to do everything. Ironically, you would accomplish more if you just stopped long enough to make a sensible plan. Although you often like to figure out what you're doing on the fly, it's a frivolity you can't afford now. Be realistic and cut back on your activities until you establish a more sustainable pace."
cancer,2011-10-22,"You may have a brilliant idea that enables you to perform up to someone else's expectations while actually earning more independence in the process. You would like to escape from an overly rigid routine and, thankfully, your good-natured approach to work today could be the catalyst you need. But wishing for things to change isn't enough; you need to have a concrete plan and be willing to work hard in order to have a shot at breaking free."
leo,2011-10-22,"You may feel safe while you're on familiar ground at work or at home today, but alluring Venus is tempting you to try something new. Unfortunately, it's not a wise idea to drop everything in search of joyful indulgences until you take care of your basic financial chores, such as paying your bills and balancing your accounts. The order of things is important now, so set intelligent priorities and then stick with them."
virgo,2011-10-22,"You could be very self-critical as you do your own performance review today. Nothing that anyone else says will be enough to let you off the hook. There's no escape; you need to process your disappointment and deal with the discouragement that recently surfaced. Although self-doubt isn't useful, constructive self-analysis leads you to new insights about yourself."
libra,2011-10-22,"The Moon's entry into your 12th House of Secrets today suggests that hidden obstacles are more problematic than obvious ones. You might have a hunch that you are missing an important piece of information, but you can't figure out where to uncover it or even what it is. Thankfully, you can prevent frustration by simply accepting your current limitations. Your positive thinking can be your greatest strength now."
scorpio,2011-10-22,"You're feeling more social today as the Moon enters your 11th House of Community. Although you still want to accomplish a lot at work, you don't have the same drive that you might have had yesterday and prefer to spend time with your friends, instead. It's likely that they will rise to the occasion and support your plans, even if they don't agree with what you want to do."
sagittarius,2011-10-22,"Instead of accepting anyone else's authority now, you are ready to take charge of the situation yourself. Although others may be fully capable of handling whatever's happening today, you believe that your combination of organizational skills and applicable knowledge gives you an important edge. Don't be afraid to let everyone know what your plan is prior to your implementation. Including others makes it easier for them to jump in and help you reach your goals."
capricorn,2011-10-22,"It might be wise to hold back your feelings today as the Moon shifts into analytical Virgo. But you could feel incapable of seeing the big picture now and are even tempted to cancel a trip to someplace special because you don't have enough time. Don't get too discouraged; there may be a very good reason to stay close to home, even if it takes a few days to see the logic of your thinking."
aquarius,2011-10-22,"You're itching to break out of an old relationship pattern, but you have enough common sense now to bide your time and see what happens, instead of doing something you might later regret. Unfortunately, you don't want to negotiate away your independence, making you a tough partner these days. Nevertheless, you won't be happy unless you can find a way to express your personal freedom. Even while asserting your self-reliance, showing up with warmth and honesty will help your cause."
pisces,2011-10-22,"You might believe that you can float along in a current relationship, yet your friend or lover might want more of a commitment than you're willing to make. Discussing specific issues could scare the heck out of you now, even if your partner seems to enjoy the conversation. Don't just give in; you have a lot to learn now by exploring your resistance. If you acquiesce without expressing your needs, you could set a bad precedence for the days ahead."
aries,2011-10-23,"It may feel as if the party's over and it's time to get down to business. You are so intent on proving what you can do that you need to be careful about making too many commitments. Even if your intentions are honorable, you could set yourself up for failure by promising more than you can possibly deliver. It's a smarter long-term strategy to be clear from the beginning about what you can't do than agreeing to do too much."
taurus,2011-10-23,"You might grow angry if someone won't support your plans today, but sharing your annoyance probably won't do much to make the situation any better. Instead of getting worked up by the growing tension, don't over-personalize the lack of cooperation. It's wiser to just address the specific criticism you receive with an open mind. Rather than slipping into an adversarial relationship, find a way that allows everyone to partake in the joy of a common victory."
gemini,2011-10-23,"You may be required to handle an emotional crisis today which could make you feel rather uncomfortable. You would normally prefer to sidestep an unpleasant situation, but now it's wiser to simply face the music. Although avoiding confrontation is often a successful strategy for you, you need to overcome a ridge of resistance. Fortunately, you'll feel better once you decide to tackle the issue head-on. If it's difficult at first, remember that things will get easier as you go along."
cancer,2011-10-23,"Stand up strong and don't let anyone bully you today. Defending your position is important, but winning the conflict isn't as crucial as it seems in the moment. What's more significant is establishing yourself as someone who must be reckoned with. Even if you have to give in, you'll make it known that you're not an easy target. Don't be afraid to express your feelings because they give you the strength to be yourself."
leo,2011-10-23,"There may be a big difference between your feelings and your actions today. In fact, your behavior could say one thing while your analytical process leads you somewhere else. Nevertheless, your emotions will probably prevail now in a border skirmish between your head and your heart. Logic may be helpful when answering a question, but not when sharing what's in your heart."
virgo,2011-10-23,"Although your feelings may seem more straightforward now, it could take days to untangle the complex threads of everyone's differing perspectives. You might believe that you can overcome old fears and take part in the current discussion, but there's more to the emotional drama than meets your eyes. Don't fall into the trap of thinking you have all the answers. Stay true to your heart while remaining flexible enough to change your mind as the situation continues to evolve."
libra,2011-10-23,"You could feel a bit let down today as the brilliant Sun leaves your sign for the darker world of Scorpio. Nevertheless, you may not be ready to jump into the shadowy realms because you don't want to complicate everything by exploring your feelings. Even if you prefer the lighthearted banter, remember that the upcoming changes are big ones and that being connected with your emotions helps you stay centered."
scorpio,2011-10-23,"The Sun returns to regenerative Scorpio today for a month-long visit that can bring hidden feelings out into the light of awareness. Your position is already changing, although there is still so much more for you to learn. You may feel as if you have done a lot of hard work, so the rest should be easier. Unfortunately, you're not off the hook yet. Whatever your plans are for the future, don't underestimate the intense transformative power of these times."
sagittarius,2011-10-23,"It could feel like an inspirational light has been turned on now that the Sun is traveling through your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Rather than telling everyone about your intriguing inner process, keep your feelings to yourself for a while longer. However, it's not healthy to sacrifice your integrity by lightly glossing over something that must be said. As long as you are considerate of other people's feelings, being honest won't steer you wrong."
capricorn,2011-10-23,"The perceptive Virgo Moon visits your 9th House of Adventure to fill you with hope and confidence. However, tough Mars forms a sesquisquare to dark Pluto, sending you on a quick trip into the depths of your subconscious mind where you may feel very vulnerable. Don't be afraid; there's nothing wrong with this journey of the soul, unless you stubbornly try to cling to an outmoded way of seeing the world."
aquarius,2011-10-23,"It's time to place your attention on your professional path now that the Sun is shining in your 10th House of Career and Public Life. However, your ambitious goals may require you to hide your personal desires for a while so they don't get in the way. Tread carefully; it's not wise to bury your reactions so deeply that you can't even remember what you are feeling. Remember, even if your emotions are inconvenient sometimes, they still motivate you to connect with others."
pisces,2011-10-23,It seems like new waves of emotions are washing over you today and could rejuvenate your life. But you can still feel overwhelmed at times because difficult aspects prevent you from relaxing in the moment now. The cosmic intensity acts like a catalyst that opens your heart if you don't waste energy wrestling with your fears. Expressing your worries is your cheapest insurance against shutting down your heart.
aries,2011-10-24,"You may try to please everyone today, but you could end up alienating others if you don't consider your needs, too. The social Libra Moon in your 7th House of Relationships tempts you to deny your own desires in favor of taking care of someone else. Unfortunately, codependency won't help you or your partner reach satisfaction. Avoid the trappings of frustration by expressing what you want as honestly as possible. Friendship and intimacy grow from a foundation of integrity and trust."
taurus,2011-10-24,"You want to be of service to others now that the Moon is in your 6th House of Work, but making money isn't necessarily your primary concern. You might be drawn to helping those who are less fortunate than you, or, maybe, you wish to pay back a debt to society to balance old karma. In any case, it's healthy to know your limits by considering what you're willing to give up to achieve your altruistic goals. Making commitments is serious business, so think twice before overextending yourself."
gemini,2011-10-24,"You're determined to find ways to alter the daily routine of your life, but you're not interested in upsetting the status quo. You just want to provide room for making improvements. Perhaps you have grown tired of having so many good ideas, only to discover that the big things in your life remain unchanged. Unfold your new goals slowly; the tiniest modifications can have the longest lasting impact."
cancer,2011-10-24,"Family dynamics are highlighted when the Moon returns to your 4th House of Security today. But if parenting is your primary responsibility, then you might just have less free time available for other activities now. But having a good time isn't your primary motivation; it's more about being available to those you love, even if it prevents you from doing something you enjoy. Fortunately, the quiet satisfaction derived from nurturing a loved one may be the greatest gift you can receive."
leo,2011-10-24,"You may require some downtime today so you can think about the recent twists and turns in your life. Unfortunately, the road ahead is not very easy to navigate, so it's a sensible idea to visualize a more direct route to success. Don't be concerned if there aren't immediate changes in your circumstances, for it may take some time for the current resistance to fade away."
virgo,2011-10-24,"You could run into a speed bump on the road of life today and though it requires you to slow down, there's no need for a detour. Just take unexpected events in stride and do the best you can. Don't allow yourself to succumb to discouragement, even if you face a major setback. Consider obstacles as perfect opportunities to keep improving your plan. Strengthening your body and mind now will increase your chances to succeed."
libra,2011-10-24,"It's harder these days to take your responsibilities lightly because the Moon and somber Saturn are both in your sign, setting the tone for the day. Don't waste precious energy trying to put on a cheerful face for others, just because that's what they expect from you. It isn't your job to make everyone feel okay about the issues you face. Nevertheless, it's up to you to look inward and ask yourself tough questions so you can gain clarity about the next phase of your life."
scorpio,2011-10-24,"You may not want to talk about your emotions with the Moon and Saturn hiding out in your 12th House of Secrecy. But your need to be alone doesn't include your very best friends or lover, since you long for the deep emotional connections that can break through your current isolation. Remember that interpersonal walls are created by mutual consent, so open your heart to invite in those with whom you want to share your life."
sagittarius,2011-10-24,"You only have so much free time available today, but you still want to escape for a bit, anyhow. Meanwhile, your workmates and friends keep reminding you of how many tasks you still have to complete. There are only so many hours in the day, so you may not be able to take time off to play now. Nevertheless, remaining focused on what's most crucial will be rewarded later on. There's no need to explain your choices; just follow your instincts and take care of the business at hand."
capricorn,2011-10-24,"You may feel a lot of stress now, but this is your perfect chance to prove your competence to your boss. The reflective Moon and karmic Saturn in your 10th House of Career marks the culmination of your recent efforts or the beginning of an exciting new project. In either case, this is no time to relax. Don't worry if no one seems to be acknowledging your contribution. Recognition is likely to happen soon enough."
aquarius,2011-10-24,"Even well thought-out plans could meet up with opposition, but your ideas can still reach fruition if you're open to making smart changes. Don't be stubborn; acting as if you're on top won't help you reach your goals any faster. Something must change; fortunately, others are willing to meet you halfway if you demonstrate some flexibility. There's no need to give up if you're wise enough to modify your strategy."
pisces,2011-10-24,"You could face a difficult situation today if you must deal with someone who holds authority over you while remaining unsupportive of your efforts. It may be a difficult climb and although it requires extra determination to reach your destination, the process also makes you stronger. Don't complain about your obligations; just roll up your sleeves and get busy. If you put forth your best effort the rewards will eventually follow."
aries,2011-10-25,"You might attempt to withdraw from a conflict with a friend because you don't want to reveal too much about your inner process. You would like to make your point diplomatically, but could say something you'll quickly regret today if you become overly emotional. Meanwhile, you know that escapist behavior won't benefit you in the long run. Take a risk and say what's on your mind because you have a chance now to overcome your current resistance to change."
taurus,2011-10-25,"Encountering obstacles at work is never fun, but today someone who has been in your way may be ready to move aside. Ironically, you might not have to say anything, for your actions will have more impact than your words. However, you can't get away with just going through the motions; your behavior must be consistent with what's in your heart. Your path should clear once you acknowledge that your fears have been fueling the resistance you faced."
gemini,2011-10-25,"You might try to avoid making a commitment today because you think that you'll be better off if you keep your options open. Unfortunately, you could miss out on a great opportunity if your irrational fears warp your judgment. Instead, consider how making plans gives you the structure you need to increase your productivity. If your creative endeavors don't pan out as you expect, you can always redirect your efforts later in the day."
cancer,2011-10-25,"Your emotional perceptions are keen today, but you could inadvertently mix up old memories with the current situation. Your insecurities may be tied to an old pattern of attachment that has been followed by disappointment. But you're not obliged to repeat the past; instead, clear your slate by retelling your story in a new and different way, one that doesn't place blame on anyone else for your feelings. Once you take full responsibility for your reactions, you'll be freer to open your heart even wider."
leo,2011-10-25,"You could gain strength now from realizing a new sense of purpose, but you must also acknowledge the inherent weaknesses of those in your immediate environment. Someone else's shortcomings can remind you of your own fears. Or, perhaps, taking care of a loved one might drain you more than you wish. There aren't any simple answers today; nevertheless, your loyalty to those you love will bring priceless rewards."
virgo,2011-10-25,"Clarity is returning, but it still is too soon for you to make any big decisions. Your emotions continue to cloud your cool analytical style, even if you can tell where the current situation is leading. Attempts to make changes today may not be very effective, for they tend to be subsumed by larger shifts that are coming your way. Avoid impulsive action that's prompted by frustration; patience is your best strategy."
libra,2011-10-25,"Don't worry about someone who thinks that you should be more decisive today. Your strength originates in your ability to understand all sides of an issue, especially now that so many people are stuck in their negative perceptions. Your friends will ultimately appreciate how you can quickly spot the potential that someone else might pass by without ever noticing."
scorpio,2011-10-25,"You might need to face some ghosts from your past, buy they're not likely frightening enough for you to totally avoid them today. Thankfully, your desires are strong now, luring you to the edge of excitement, even if you still need to work out more details before you can achieve satisfaction. Don't let old fears stand in the way of an exciting possibility that is right around the corner."
sagittarius,2011-10-25,"You may feel pulled between your desire to stay involved as a member of a team and your need to spend some time alone. Fortunately, if you have been working diligently, you should be able to escape for a while without others minding your temporary absence. Although you could benefit from a bit of quiet time now, you'll still be able to reconnect with your co-workers without having any regrets about missing some of the action today."
capricorn,2011-10-25,"You are thinking about your future, but a part of you stays in the present moment because you have concerns that haven't yet been addressed today. Maybe you're afraid that you won't have enough time, money or love to fulfill your dreams. Although this is a real dilemma, you will gain more from having an enjoyable experience now than worrying about what may or may not arrive later."
aquarius,2011-10-25,"You need your independence now and might become rebellious if you're told that you cannot do something. You have additional emotional charges because of the similarity between the obstacles you face today and ones that you previously couldn't overcome. Although being hesitant in the past was a smart idea, today you could push through these old insecurities. If your ideas are truly worthwhile, they're also worth defending."
pisces,2011-10-25,"You may feel nervous about taking a risk today, but you'll gain confidence once you let your heart lead the way. Confidently move through your logical concerns and allow your emotions to lead you through the uncertainty. Don't rush your process; you could ruin the outcome if you move too quickly. However, pushing against your anxiety like a sailboat leans into the wind gives you the maximum advantage and an excellent chance for success."
aries,2011-10-26,"Today's possessive Scorpio New Moon energizes your 8th House of Shared Resources, highlighting a business or personal relationship that takes center stage as the specifics of a commitment are negotiated. But discussions can be tricky now because strong emotions might turn combative. Fortunately, logic will prevail if you remember that losing your temper won't help your cause. Think strategically instead of just trying to get your way at any cost."
taurus,2011-10-26,"The passionate Scorpio New Moon draws energy to your 7th House of Relationships today, agitating an emotional struggle with someone who can be as bullheaded as you are now. Although being more flexible than usual can defuse the situation, you're both likely to have strong opinions. Don't fall prey to your own impulsive desires; you'll be happier if you take the high road by showing your willingness to compromise."
gemini,2011-10-26,"Sometimes you excel at avoiding issues that can positively impact your daily routine. However, you may be ready to start a new exercise program or diet with today's New Moon in your 6th House of Health and Habits. Just make sure that your resolve matches your enthusiasm. Don't try to improve everything all at once; create a manageable plan so you don't fall short of your goals."
cancer,2011-10-26,"The powerful Scorpio New Moon increases your romantic desires as it stimulates your 5th House of Love and Creativity. You want to present a more passionate side of yourself today and may be very serious about making others understand what you're feeling. Ironically, you could try so hard that your intensity gets in the way of your message. Fortunately, you can lighten up the energy by being more playful. You'll have a better shot at reaching satisfaction if everyone is at ease."
leo,2011-10-26,"You may have big ideas about what you want to accomplish at work today, but the inflexible Scorpio New Moon in your 4th House of Home and Family uncovers pressing domestic responsibilities. You might be overly concerned that these personal issues could hijack your professional aspirations, but surprisingly they could give you more energy than they take. Don't resist what you have to do because a methodical approach will enable you to do it all."
virgo,2011-10-26,"You might try to reclaim your power and make some last minute changes to your schedule. But it won't be as easy as you think because it's difficult to break commitments without creating a whole new set of problems. Today's rigid Scorpio New Moon activates your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, reminding you to follow through on previous promises before unnecessarily making your life even more complicated."
libra,2011-10-26,Make the most of today's perceptive Scorpio New Moon in your 2nd House of Money by planning your finances for the next few weeks. It doesn't matter if your cash flow is in good or bad condition; you benefit either way by creating a sensible budget. Just keep in mind that you could make a significant error if you take any shortcuts. Take your time and think through your assumptions; it's better to be safe than sorry.
scorpio,2011-10-26,"You may believe that your wishes can come true today as the New Moon in your sign plants seeds of intention in your 1st House of Self. But a difficult Mercury-Pluto aspect could turn a casual desire into an obsession if you don't temper extreme emotions with a more calculated and logical approach. Go ahead and ask for what you want, but then let go of your attachment to the outcome. Paradoxically, relaxing your grip on the reins will actually give you more control in the long run."
sagittarius,2011-10-26,"You may feel as if a phase of your life is nearing conclusion, but this is really a sign that new opportunities are around the next corner. The mysterious Scorpio New Moon in your 12th House of Destiny opposes your key planet Jupiter, making the current transition even more significant than you realize. Just don't expect your natural optimism to make up for a lack of work. Scaling back your expectations and working harder should help you get what you want."
capricorn,2011-10-26,"Today's controlling Scorpio New Moon in your 11th House of Social Networking encourages you to reserve your participation in a group until you are sure that your intentions are aligned with theirs. Don't be overly casual about your involvement with friends and associates now, for they could change the direction of your current trajectory. Rather than going along with the crowd, establish your own path based on what's most important to you."
aquarius,2011-10-26,Your career is most likely your main focus today as the potent Scorpio New Moon spotlights your 10th House of Public Status. You are wise to seriously consider your options prior to initiating any new plans because spending energy on a project that distracts you from your real goals is a waste of time. Trust your intuition now; it will steer you in the right direction.
pisces,2011-10-26,"You are resistant to being talked out of your opinions today with the penetrating Scorpio New Moon falling in your 9th House of Beliefs. You think that you can see through the veils of illusion and into the inner core of reality, but all is not exactly as it appears. The Moon's opposition to optimistic Jupiter makes it easy to convince yourself that your ideas are facts. Be vigilant and make sure your goals are realistic before finding yourself too far along a road that's taking you in the wrong direction."
aries,2011-10-27,"You could worry about an issue today that ultimately isn't all that important. Thinking about the consequences of your words is wise because your fears might provoke you to say something that is hurtful. Luckily, your actions will speak louder than words now with your key planet Mars on display in your 5th House of Self-Expression. It may be challenging to keep your rapid-fire repartee under control, but it is surely worth the effort."
taurus,2011-10-27,"You may not be able to find a pace that works for you at first today, but your persistence should pay off. You could initiate action too quickly, only to realize that you must do it again if it isn't exactly right. Don't be stubborn if you discover that you're wrong. Your relationships will improve if you are flexible enough to listen to reason instead of fearfully holding on to a perspective that doesn't stand up to the truth."
gemini,2011-10-27,"You may feel agitated today as Mercury and Venus are challenged by combative Mars. Your legendary wit can grow sarcastic, turning clever words into acerbic verbal jabs. Unfortunately, your coworkers probably won't stand for your misplaced aggression. Even the most casual conversation can quickly escalate into open conflict unless you stay aware of what's really happening. If it isn't a matter of highest concern, keep the peace by backing down as gracefully as possible."
cancer,2011-10-27,"It may be very difficult to dramatically alter your behavior today, even if you know how much it would help to make some basic changes. But knowing the truth alone obviously isn't enough because your actions don't automatically conform to your rational thinking. Nevertheless, you're still ultimately responsible for whatever you do, so don't just take the course of least resistance."
leo,2011-10-27,"You could convince yourself that you're on such an urgent mission today that nothing can get in your way. Unfortunately, your self-doubt could turn out to be the most significant source of resistance. It's wise to dig deeper in search of the truth, but questioning your own abilities is a waste of time and energy. Although you may not be able to make your fears disappear overnight, you don't have to let them have power over you."
virgo,2011-10-27,"You want to follow the schedule that you created for today, but unseen forces prevent you from executing your plan. You might work yourself up into a state of anxiety if you are too unyielding. You could even lose your temper and say something to a loved one without realizing the negative impact of your words until it's too late. If tension is growing, remind yourself to remain flexible. Going along with the flow is smarter now than resisting it."
libra,2011-10-27,"Your heart and your head aren't reading from the same script today, challenging you to observe how your behavior affects others. You could be very stubborn if anyone suggests that you are being a non-conformist and a contrarian now because you don't believe that you're the one who is stirring up the trouble. Nevertheless, your day takes a turn for the better when you relax the reins of control."
scorpio,2011-10-27,"Your thoughts are quite intense today, making you feel like everyone can actually hear what you're thinking. Venus and Mercury in passionate Scorpio form tense squares with assertive Mars, coercing you to speak your mind without worrying about the consequences. Thankfully, you have the power to transmute fear into love, allowing you to choose the most creative path in each of your interactions."
sagittarius,2011-10-27,"You may have a very clear idea of exactly where you're going now, but your action plan could be flawed with irrational logic or incorrect assumptions. Thankfully, you are able to overcome poor reasoning if you can trust your intuition. Don't fret about the details; just be flexible and play it by ear as you move through your day. Even if you cannot justify your unusual strategy, it should work for you today, anyhow."
capricorn,2011-10-27,"You are a tough opponent in a public debate today, but stop and consider the price you may need to pay for your victory. Ruthless intentions can be unleashed now if you take a position contrary to your family or friends. You're the only one who can decide whether or not it's worth it. There's no right or wrong choice here as long as you think about the consequences in advance, and not after creating needless emotional pain."
aquarius,2011-10-27,"You may feel insecure about a relationship with a good friend or partner today or about your success at work, but you should be able to transcend your fears through spiritual practice. For some, prayer may be the best way to handle the current stress, but your personal journey might also contain meditation, dance or a relaxing nature walk. As long as you can step outside of your interpersonal concerns now, it doesn't really matter what tools you use to awaken your cosmic connection."
pisces,2011-10-27,"You may feel blocked at work today, yet the more you think about the obstacles, the larger they become. Although you might be justified in some of your concerns, it will take longer than just one single day to fix your current predicament. Nevertheless, it's still a smart idea to examine your plans and adjust them as necessary before forging ahead."
aries,2011-10-28,"Trickster Mercury short-circuits your mental wiring today, making you believe that someone is threatening you, even if that's not the case. Fortunately, you can avoid overreacting by just being aware of your current tendency to make everything more important than it actually is. Ultimately, your decisions should work out for the best as long as you don't jump to conclusions that justify unkind behavior."
taurus,2011-10-28,"You may try to be fair-minded in a partnership, but you cannot maintain your objectivity today. It's not easy to express your annoyance with someone close to you, because you don't want to waste energy on activities that detract from what you need to do. Unfortunately, holding your emotions quiet only adds to your irritation. Take a deep breath and then share your feelings -- even if they are negative -- but do it without blaming anyone else."
gemini,2011-10-28,"Warrior Mars stresses your planetary ruler Mercury today, luring you into an unpleasant exchange of words. You might think that your professional status is at stake, but it's likely that you are so sensitive now that you make a big deal out of something that's not all that important. Step back before reacting; try to understand what's currently happening instead of attempting to change it."
cancer,2011-10-28,"Someone may accuse you of being negative today, yet you might believe that you are acting like a Pollyanna. Your denial doesn't do much to settle others down as they ask you to explain your behavior. Don't allow yourself to get sucked into peripheral dramas, but if it's true that you have been hiding your frustrations it will feel better to get them out into the open."
leo,2011-10-28,"You may not be willing to take the time now to explain your current actions or even your rationale for doing nothing. You feel that it's your right to keep your feelings to yourself. Unfortunately, you can add more confusion to the situation if you don't share your motives when you have the opportunity to do so. Even if you think that you have something better to do today, let your friends and associates know exactly what's on your mind."
virgo,2011-10-28,"Your close friends may encourage you to talk about something you usually prefer to keep to yourself as forceful Mars antagonizes your key planet Mercury. Even if you know better, you could still lose your temper today and give someone a piece of your mind. Keep in mind that angry words don't make anyone happier, so think twice before you escalate a minor difference of opinion into an open conflict."
libra,2011-10-28,"Your rational thinking isn't enough to keep you even-keeled these days as wordy Mercury squares combative Mars. Your friends and associates might not play fairly when they refuse to get involved in a discussion, but all you want is a bit of honest feedback. Paradoxically, it may work backwards now; if you push too hard, others will just retreat even further. Fortunately, giving them room to breathe allows them to finally come out of their shells."
scorpio,2011-10-28,"You may experience another layer of frustration as you try to handle an already tricky situation. Thankfully, jolly Jupiter trines your key planet Pluto, giving you the endurance to follow through on whatever you start. But your eyes are larger than your tummy now, tempting you to bite off more than you can chew. Taking a few steps backward to reconsider what makes the most sense is a viable strategy to get what you want."
sagittarius,2011-10-28,"You can become involved in lengthy discussions at work as the Moon returns to your bombastic sign and enthusiastic Jupiter enters your 6th House of Employment. However, you may grow annoyed if others are less than forthcoming with their true intentions now that Jupiter trines underhanded Pluto. You're impatient and don't understand why your workmates don't just come right out and say what's on their minds. Even if it's frustrating, practicing tolerance teaches you ways to overcome previous conditioning."
capricorn,2011-10-28,"If your friends are acting belligerently toward you now, the situation may not be what it appears. Your emotional self-restraint can be very annoying to someone who burns hotter than you. The long-term solution to the current imbalance might not be the obvious one. Instead of telling others to back off, the answer may be for you to show your feelings. Ironically, a potential fight could be avoided by your willingness to share your emotions before a conflict grows out of hand."
aquarius,2011-10-28,"You prefer to be left alone so you can get your work done today, but your co-workers continue to bother you with their great ideas. Before you overreact, try changing your mind about what's happening in the present moment. If you attempt to shut others up now, they'll just get angry and probably grow even more vocal. But if you take their suggestions in stride, they will feel acknowledged and you might even learn something important in the process."
pisces,2011-10-28,"You are experiencing everything with greater intensity today and this can be very draining on those around you. But don't turn off your feelings, for any form of avoidance or denial only makes the atmosphere even more intense. However, keep in mind that you don't need to express every thought or share every passion that stirs your soul."
aries,2011-10-29,"You have a lot going on in your life now, and yet you're still very enthusiastic about what's ahead. Even though your current trajectory is leading you into exciting new territory, it's going to take a while for you to reach your goals. Keep in mind that there's no time for distracting yourself with unimportant frivolities. Procrastination is tempting, but self-discipline is required if you're going to deliver what you promised."
taurus,2011-10-29,"You might be concerned with what happens next in an existing personal or business relationship. Even if you're pleased that the everyday routine is functioning smoothly now, you can't help but still want more. It's beneficial to reach beyond existing assumptions and limitations. Although there may be good news right around the corner, you must take the initiative and extend yourself to receive it."
gemini,2011-10-29,"It feels as if a world of possibilities is opening up in front of you now and you're able to get a hint of what your future might be like. However, it may not seem like the vision is really yours because it probably is shared with you by a friend or co-worker. Unfortunately, you could easily miss a significant piece of information if you're distracted by your own thoughts. Listen carefully and be receptive to what you hear so that you know what steps to take next."
cancer,2011-10-29,"Your first reaction to a new opportunity at work could be one of uncertainty because you think that others are in denial about the amount of effort that will be required to complete the job right. You're tempted to set them straight if you believe that they're leaving out important details, but this might make you sound more negative than you actually feel. Don't respond immediately; take time and consider how to speak your truth in a constructive and positive manner."
leo,2011-10-29,"Your straightforward approach can be somewhat disconcerting to someone close to you today. You have a good sense of what you want and could surprise yourself by taking a chance and expressing your feelings. Just remember that your overtures are more likely to succeed if you adopt a more cautious attitude that allows time for processing along the way. It may be challenging to contain your energy now, but you must slow down and create a strong foundation instead of building a castle on shifting sand."
virgo,2011-10-29,"It's uncharacteristic of you to become so enthused about your future that you're tempted to start something new without regard for your regular sense of caution. Although you're eager to act with spontaneity today, it's not a smart idea to move ahead until you have all of the facts. The more advanced planning you do now, the better the results."
libra,2011-10-29,You might believe that you can get away with almost anything now because your air of confidence can clear previously insurmountable obstacles from your path. But your positive attitude won't fix everything; you aren't invincible. Don't waste energy trying to reach unrealistic goals; instead make sure your plans are sensible and that you can complete whatever you start.
scorpio,2011-10-29,"There is a fork in the road that requires you to choose the difficult path or the easier one. At first it seems like a straightforward decision, but the curves ahead obscure your vision. Wherever you want to go today, you have a better chance of getting there if you follow the map. Ultimately, the level of difficulty doesn't matter. What's important is taking concrete steps to simplify your life."
sagittarius,2011-10-29,"You can make an inspiring assessment of what's happening in your life today with the Moon in your visionary sign. You're in touch with your needs and can clearly communicate them to others in a concise manner. However, this is not the right time to waste energy on lighthearted frivolities, even if you're in a good mood and feel ready to party. Instead, concentrate on what's most significant; a serious approach will take you further now than one based upon humor."
capricorn,2011-10-29,"Your imagination can reveal the truth today, even if you're just daydreaming, as the opinionated Sagittarius Moon forms a supportive sextile with your key planet Saturn. But even if you know what's happening, you may not be ready to tell anyone else yet since the Moon is hiding in your 12th House of Secrets. Keeping your perspective to yourself until tomorrow allows you to refine your thoughts until they're ready for prime time viewing."
aquarius,2011-10-29,"The Moon's visit to your communal 11th house indicates that social networks are a lifeline to your future as friends and acquaintances encourage you to reach for the stars. However, it's not really important if you're able to turn your fantasies into reality today. Either way, it's exhilarating to feel free enough to allow your thoughts to show you what's possible tomorrow. Save your practicality for another day; being visionary in your thinking is enough for now."
pisces,2011-10-29,"You are ambitiously looking ahead so you can map out the exact details of your strategy. Thankfully, you are thinking beyond the limitations of your current job as you try to figure out your place in the world. But setting your expectations too high could leave you feeling disappointed. Nevertheless, dream big; just put your plan into action one small step at a time."
aries,2011-10-30,"Your recent enthusiasm could lead to trouble today, especially if you don't pay attention to the signs that are telling you to slow down. Your friends and workmates might not try to intervene, even if they think that you have promised more than you can deliver. Your courage is often a useful trait, but now it may interfere with your success because you can't seem to recognize your own limits. Consciously cut back on your activities before circumstances grow out of control."
taurus,2011-10-30,"Your goals may be set so high that you will probably feel disappointed later once you can see everything more clearly. You think that everyone will be as straightforward as you are now, so you're caught off guard when someone's behavior doesn't support their stated agenda. Let others know that you want to stick with your original plan, even if it's going to take more time to reach your destination."
gemini,2011-10-30,"If everyone has been overly enthusiastic about your ideas, it may become apparent today that you haven't seen the whole picture yet. There is more that's coming into view, so you might need to reconsider an earlier decision. It isn't necessary to put off making your choice as long as you aren't blinded by everyone else's over-the-top support. Ultimately, trusting yourself makes the most sense."
cancer,2011-10-30,"You might have an irresponsible approach to your obligations today, and your boss or a co-worker may let you know where your work is falling short. You're not in the mood to listen to anyone's advice and you're tempted to ignore something that you hear now, especially if it's critical of your performance. Don't put up resistance to the honest feedback; instead, you can use it to your advantage by impressing others with your willingness to change as you integrate the new information into your  perspective."
leo,2011-10-30,"You may have already taken a risk in love, but reality can shut you down pretty quickly if you've overplayed your hand. Thankfully, this means that you won't have to wait too long to know if you made a successful move. Although you still might experience a few mood swings between optimism and pessimism, the extremes should begin to settle down by the end of the day. Don't be afraid to modify your plans as you get a feel for the new emotional terrain."
virgo,2011-10-30,"You might struggle as you try to maintain your intellectual clarity now because your emotions are coloring your perceptions. Problems may arise if you try to be overly objective since suppressing your passions only fuels their power. Unfortunately, your biases will still come across in all that you do unless you carefully monitor yourself throughout the day. Don't make any important decisions today, you will be better off daydreaming about your future, instead."
libra,2011-10-30,"You wish that you could avoid the inconvenience of any emotional discomfort today, but your feelings may end up out in the open, anyway. Ironically, you might be the person who suddenly reveals something that you have been keeping secret. But instead of worrying about the consequences of what you might say, stay in the present moment and deal with each situation as it unfolds."
scorpio,2011-10-30,"You crave your independence now, but real freedom might command a very high cost. Still, you're tempted to speak your truth, even if you have to deal with the fallout from what you say. Luckily, the practical Capricorn Moon helps you to stay on message. Sharing exactly how you feel today might not lead to the outcome you expect, but you will likely end up being pleasantly surprised if you keep your heart open."
sagittarius,2011-10-30,"You may not be so transparent today as your feelings bounce back and forth between being uncontainable and expressive one moment and closed off and withdrawn the next. You might even try to get others to join in on your fun when you are on the excitable side of the equation. But as the Moon leaves your sign, the sparkle on your upbeat attitude begins to fade and you are left with the hard work it will take for you to reach your current goals. Staying positive invites the ongoing support of your friends."
capricorn,2011-10-30,"You might be feeling a bit uneasy today because you really don't like being judged. Your unexpressed worries can plant seeds of suspicion or even paranoia that double back on you during the afternoon hours. However, discussing your lack of confidence can completely change the game. Keep your communication simple so others know what to do as they work with you in a constructive manner."
aquarius,2011-10-30,"Your lack of patience can be enough to wake you up early today. But you're more likely to view the consequences of your actions with much greater clarity later in the day. Don't shut down your positive thinking too soon, for it can inspire you to reach greater heights. Instead, shift the intensity of your emotions into a drive that helps you ferret out whatever you need to know before you make an important decision."
pisces,2011-10-30,"The continuing pressure from your job creates stress that can take a considerable toll on your relationships. You can't ignore your professional commitments, but avoiding your personal obligations won't work, either. Don't let your unbridled hope tempt you to make empty promises at work or at home, for you will be required to come through with the goods later in the day."
aries,2011-10-31,"You are smooth as silk today and can spin fantastic stories to support your goals. The images you use seem real to others as you describe your plan or try to get someone to join your cause. However, you should tread carefully because you can convince yourself that you are right, even if you're missing the point. Telling everyone what to do may work out okay as long as you consider the needs of the whole community and not just yours."
taurus,2011-10-31,"You might not be able to turn off the flow of fantasies that spring forth from your imagination today, but you still can be totally aware of what you do with your ideas. Your idealism enriches your day by bringing an endless supply of creative material, but this stream of ideas or pictures can also distract you from your real work. Escaping into dreams may not seem productive, but using them for motivation is a wise strategy now."
gemini,2011-10-31,"You may not be interested in beating around the bush now; you're eager to say whatever's necessary to justify your position. Nevertheless, you are afraid of hurting someone's feelings, so you could start off tentatively. You might be pleasantly surprised by all the feedback you receive that clears the way for constructive conversations. Keep your facts straight today, because a faulty assumption on your part can turn a spirited discussion into a comedy of misunderstandings."
cancer,2011-10-31,"Expressing your feelings with someone you trust at work might not be on your agenda today, but something may stimulate a strong reaction, prompting you to share everything that's on your mind. Be careful because once you begin to talk, you could inadvertently say too much. Thankfully, it's simple to prevent an awkward situation by just seriously considering what you are going to say before you open your mouth."
leo,2011-10-31,"Your creativity is flowing strongly today, whether you are working or simply enjoying yourself. You might not want to plan too many details of your day, since each activity slips dreamily into the next one. But you must stay on your toes, for your heightened emotions allow you to be easily misled now. Verbal communication may be the source of misunderstandings, so watch what others do before trusting what they say."
virgo,2011-10-31,"You may have inflated hopes about a family gathering, and can run into trouble if you harbor unrealistic expectations. Your ruling planet Mercury encourages you to daydream now, but you could turn a perfectly sensible idea into a grand fiasco. As tempted as you are to expand on a smart theme, it's smarter to keep plans simple and the drama to a minimum."
libra,2011-10-31,"You are a master illusionist today as your key planet Venus squares surreal Neptune. This can work to your advantage if you are the host or hostess that ends up dealing with others' unresolved feelings. Your diplomatic skills assist you in influencing others with your fair-minded perspective. Keep in mind that intuition can lead you down the wrong path, so pay attention to the facts for the greatest positive impact."
scorpio,2011-10-31,"Family dynamics may be confusing now because someone is quick to hide his or her true feelings. It's difficult to know what others want unless you're willing to climb out on a limb and ask them. This may sound straightforward enough, yet you might end up hearing a lot more than you wanted to know. Nevertheless, you'll be better off when you learn the truth and then can honestly share what's on your mind."
sagittarius,2011-10-31,"The power of your convictions should be enough to help someone else through an episode of low self-esteem today. The smartest reaction to uncertainty now is to quickly get your facts in order, and then talk about what can be done to clarify the issues. Don't be afraid of looking ahead; the bold actions you take can set the pace for your friends and family."
capricorn,2011-10-31,"Your schedule may keep you busier than you imagined, even if you were planning on less activity rather than more. But the current noise in your life might seem worse than it really is today because you cannot determine how to turn off the stream of creative thoughts and unconventional feelings. Remembering that you don't always need to be in control of everything; letting go allows you to enjoy every moment for exactly what it is."
aquarius,2011-10-31,"You're aware of what's best for everyone else now, and would like to be acknowledged for your altruistic behavior. However, your ideals could be incongruent with your emotional needs. Fortunately, you won't have to choose one over the other. If you can muster up enough courage to talk about how your inner desires conflict with your responsibilities, you might be able to achieve satisfaction on both fronts."
pisces,2011-10-31,"You have a long list of chores that may be left over from last week, but you seem to feel unsure of your ability to accomplish much at all today. The best strategy to deal with your current concerns is to concentrate on fulfilling your social and professional obligations as soon as possible. Your doubts will lessen as soon as you start crossing things off your list. You can indulge in the pursuit of pleasure once you are done."
aries,2011-11-01,"You may not know what to do with the brilliant ideas that pop into your head today. Ironically, friends and coworkers become less convinced that your approach will work the more you try to explain it. They may agree with your position, but they're not sure that you can transform your clever strategy into a practical plan. It won't help to ramble on about what you will do. Save your long speeches for another time; for now, lead with actions rather than words."
taurus,2011-11-01,"You believe that you're being very realistic, but you probably won't have such a firm grip on reality today. At first you may persuade others that you're in control, but you are more likely to confuse them as you contradict yourself later on. Although you're able to explain a complicated concept now, it's more challenging to just give simple directions. Be smart and let someone else temporarily hold the reins of control."
gemini,2011-11-01,"Your key planet Mercury is in its trickster mode today as it squares irrational Neptune. You may try to think clearly, but it's challenging to finish sentences when your ideas float off into the mists of illusion and fantasy. Remember your analytical process is muddled now, so don't be overly certain about what you know. Wait a couple of days before reconsidering your options."
cancer,2011-11-01,"You may be better off today by remaining as silent as possible. If you avoid saying too much, you can come out of a tangled emotional web appearing as if you are a real hero. Although it could be difficult to see both sides of a conflict now, you still realize that there's no single straightforward solution. Pretending to have the answer will probably just create disappointment; your wisest strategy is to wait it out. If you have something crucial to add to the discussion, it will be even more relevant in a day or two."
leo,2011-11-01,"It's very reassuring when your personal goals are consistent with your actual duties at work. However, it can be quite disconcerting now if they're not. Your current situation may be complicated by a friend or business partner who isn't communicating clearly. If you're trying to finalize a decision, it would be better to have the support of those around you. Be patient; others will begin to cooperate more in the days ahead."
virgo,2011-11-01,"This can be an unusual but exciting day when you're more inclined to tell a story or write a poem than act in a fully rational manner. You want everyone to acknowledge how clever you are, but it isn't easy to concentrate on details today. Don't set yourself up for failure by trying to deliver something beyond your current capability. Give yourself permission to lose yourself in a daydream; you can always return to your work tomorrow."
libra,2011-11-01,"Your sign of The Scales symbolizes your commitment to seeking balance, even when it's elusive. You might end up spinning your wheels today if you think you can use logic to find the calm center of the storm. But you won't re-establish your center of gravity by keeping still; instead of sitting in a yoga pose, imagine that you are a figure skater in motion. Your easy grace arises from being one with the flow rather than trying to cling to the status quo."
scorpio,2011-11-01,"You aren't in the mood to argue with anyone who seems to know all the answers since you don't feel the need to prove anything. However, it won't help if you just walk away from a discussion simply because you're afraid that a disagreement will ensue. Remember that it always takes two to create conflict. Demonstrate your wisdom by remaining clear about your facts and beliefs without having to compete with others."
sagittarius,2011-11-01,"You can turn a rather mundane day into an exciting one as long as you don't attempt to resolve the dualistic way you approach life today. On one hand, you're thinking like an analytical scientist, carefully observing your current situation in a cool and detached manner. But on the other hand, you're like an artist, directly engaging your experiences by responding with a wide spectrum of emotions. Each method has something of value to offer, so tune in to your head and your heart at the same time without closing down either one."
capricorn,2011-11-01,"You want to believe that your instincts won't steer you wrong because the Moon is back in your pragmatic sign. However, you may have temporarily lost your ability to separate threads that are spun in your imagination from those that are woven with reality. Normally you are a champ at keeping fact and fiction distinct, yet now the fabric of life contains both. Don't overanalyze what's happening; just appreciate the magic of what you can create."
aquarius,2011-11-01,"You are motivated to communicate the recent vague visions you've been having, but the more you try to describe them, the less others understand. Your thoughts are elusive and cannot easily fit into words, unless you have a particular spiritual discipline that helps you to frame your experience. Awakening your inner artist, poet or mystic, however, can help you explain the subtleties of your current perspective."
pisces,2011-11-01,"Logical Mercury is forming a creative square with your ruling planet Neptune, opening your imagination to realities that exist beyond the realm of language. This can be very confusing if you want to be specific in your communication today. Unfortunately, even the most basic ideas are slippery now. Instead of increasing your frustration by trying to manage too many details, put this kind of work off until tomorrow when your concentration returns."
aries,2011-11-02,"There could be danger ahead if all you see is the sunny side of everything. Nevertheless, it's still smarter to concentrate on the positive possibilities instead of the negative. Although affirmations are extra potent today, also acknowledging what could go wrong gives you the opportunity to recognize a potential problem before it becomes critical. Addressing the weakest part of your plan doesn't have to turn you into a pessimist. You still get to create your future with every word you speak and every action you take."
taurus,2011-11-02,"You may receive overdue recognition from your co-workers or your boss today. Even better, a long-awaited raise or promotion could finally come through. Being acknowledged for your contributions is heartwarming, but you might have a tough time accepting praise now as your key planet Venus squares wounded Chiron. However, modesty isn't necessary, so overcome your uncertainty, say thank you and proudly celebrate your accomplishments."
gemini,2011-11-02,"It doesn't require much effort to start off with a fantastic strategy today and make it even bigger and better by increments. Unfortunately, your current desire to expand nearly everything in your life could turn a sensible idea into one that becomes so grandiose that it's impractical. Remember, a bit of self-restraint now is your key to success."
cancer,2011-11-02,"You are so intuitive today that it's easy to confuse your idealistic fantasies with reality. It's challenging to remain objective, even if you have a lot of facts at your disposal. But even unbiased data can become tinted with the subjective emotions that you attach to information, so don't believe for a moment that you have a corner on the truth now. Go ahead and dream about your future, but continue to pay attention to your feelings in the present moment."
leo,2011-11-02,"You might grow uncomfortable today because it's hard to find meaningful boundaries that separate you from others. The Moon is shining her stuff in your 7th House of Relationships, attracting you to the idea of being in a partnership, but you also want your freedom. Don't be afraid to reassert your independence, as long as you aren't trying to avoid an important issue. Consciously flowing with the currents should help to reduce the resistance to your opinions."
virgo,2011-11-02,"You may not be able to finish everything that you start today, even if you planned to work hard and be done early. Unfortunately, you're tempted to underestimate the time and resources necessary to complete your assignments. Handling your own disappointment is hard enough when you don't deliver what you promised, but dealing with everyone else is even tougher. Stay alert like a clever fox, and don't commit to more than you can deliver."
libra,2011-11-02,"You continue to walk a fine line as you try to balance your serious responsibilities with your incurable optimism. However, you might try to avoid exerting too much effort today, since you know there's plenty of work still coming your way. Perhaps you should steal a bit of downtime while you can. Just remember that denial isn't a smart strategy, so be aware of the consequences of what you are doing before you get into trouble."
scorpio,2011-11-02,"You might be expecting too much from a loved one or a family member today, and this sets the stage for disappointment. On the other hand, you won't let someone down if you have realistically assessed what you can do. Don't even think about over-committing just because you don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Being honest from the start is better than having to clean up the mess you make by promising the Moon and stars."
sagittarius,2011-11-02,"Friendly Venus and loquacious Mercury enter your outgoing Fire sign today, boosting your energy and amplifying the intensity of interpersonal interactions. There may be so much going on that you wonder how you're going to keep up with everything. Thankfully, your out-of-control feelings should begin to settle down by the end of the week. In the meantime, do the best you can to pace yourself to sustain your energy throughout the day."
capricorn,2011-11-02,"Step back from your current routine so you can re-evaluate your overall financial condition now. The Moon moves quickly through your 2nd House of Personal Resources, so this phase should play through before the weekend arrives. Nevertheless, don't procrastinate; at least make sure that your accounts are in order, bills are paid and that you're ready for any unexpected expenses that come your way."
aquarius,2011-11-02,"Others may see you as a positive force in their lives today as charming Venus and chatty Mercury enter your social 11th house. Even if you're struggling with other people's interference in your personal affairs, you're still able to project a positive and upbeat image. Your friends may be glad that you're doing well now, but they don't know the whole story. Sharing your uncertainties could feel like a risk, yet it can also remove barriers to cultivating a special friendship."
pisces,2011-11-02,"It's hard to separate the real world from your subconscious mind because the veil that separates these two realms is very thin now. Although Halloween has passed, the spirit realm feels nearby enough that you bump into a few ghosts of your own. Remember, your visions may seem to have little in common with reality, but that doesn't mean they lack power. Ignoring your dreams can stifle your creativity, while allowing your imagination to flow should keep you inspired."
aries,2011-11-03,"You may be lured close to the edge of an emotional cliff today, yet you're probably ready to jump even if you recognize the potential danger. Fortunately, you have a bit of magic working in your favor now and gravity might not send you crashing toward the ground. Take a risk by sharing your thoughts or feelings with someone you trust. You could be pleasantly surprised by where the conversation leads."
taurus,2011-11-03,"Typically, you take a practical approach to love, but today your mind is enticing you to explore some unconventional possibilities that are very exciting. Luckily, you're in an experimental mood and are eager to connect with someone in a completely different way. But don't venture too far too fast unless you're sure that you really want to go there."
gemini,2011-11-03,"You can fall in love with a weird idea or an unusual person today, even if you find yourself somewhere you've never been before. You don't get to recycle your same old fantasies now; familiar territory just won't hold your attention. Enjoy playing on a new social playground, but pay attention or you might find it difficult to find your way home later on."
cancer,2011-11-03,"Although you have high hopes about accomplishing a lot at work today, save the self-judgment for another day if you don't reach your goals. Rather than setting yourself up for disappointment, consider declaring the day a personal holiday, instead. Anything you can do to stir up excitement is a good idea. Remember, you can always fulfill your responsibilities  tomorrow."
leo,2011-11-03,"It begins to dawn on you today that your newfound freedom isn't just some passing phase; it's your life. Although you might have twinges of nostalgia, your future looks brighter than your past. An unconventional person may be encouraging you to take a risk by embarking on an adventure. But even if there's travel in your future, the real journey comes from opening your heart to the idea of something new and different."
virgo,2011-11-03,"Your emotions may conflict with your logic now that the Moon is visiting your 6th House of Details. But attempts at resolving the tension won't bring you happiness, for you're being pulled in two directions today. Trust your instincts and take a chance on following your gut reaction. You can always reconsider your priorities in a couple of days when your cool-headed analysis kicks back in."
libra,2011-11-03,"You want to believe what others tell you, but you might realize that someone is stretching the truth today. Ironically, this doesn't bother you much as long as you like what you're being told. Anyway, you might try to hide your feelings now because you're attracted to something unusual. Nevertheless, Venus harmonizes with quirky Uranus, so taking the extra step and sharing your fantasy can be fun. Nearly anything is possible if you aren't overly attached to the outcome."
scorpio,2011-11-03,"You may feel very confident about your finances today, even if reality doesn't fully support your conclusions. Nevertheless, you're able to break out of the mold you placed yourself in by imagining your life very different than it is now. Although you might want to be in a new situation right away, it's going to take time. Instead of feeling frustrated, give yourself permission to envision everything just as you want it. Remember, the next phase of your journey is just beginning."
sagittarius,2011-11-03,"Ironically, when your fantasies grow more real, they can also become less tempting. Your current desires may lead you down a totally unfamiliar path, and the closer you get to the end, the more uncertain you are about your choice. There is a delicate line between your unbridled imagination and what's actually possible now. Fortunately, if you're willing to take a risk, you can make an impossible dream come true."
capricorn,2011-11-03,"You are known for your down-to-earth practicality, and normally you can manage the details of your life as needed. But now you're more likely to dream about having fun than taking care of the business at hand. Although you're not sure about just abandoning all your responsibilities, you should be able to get away with letting some things slide today as long as you commit to catching up with your work later on."
aquarius,2011-11-03,"This can be a perfect day to fall in love, whether or not you're on the lookout for romance. Venus and Mercury harmonize with your key planet, Uranus, charging your system with natural charisma and irrepressible desire. There's no need to worry about stability now; it's the possible thrill that grabs your attention. However, just because you are attracted to an unusual situation, it's still not wise to act on every impulse. Consider the consequences before doing anything you might later regret."
pisces,2011-11-03,"If you could quietly slip into another dimension, every color would be perfectly matched while your favorite music was playing. Fortunately, there's no need to travel to a parallel universe today, for everything desirable seems as if it's right around the next corner, even if you never get there. Instead of trying to make all your dreams come true, pick one and strive to make it real."
aries,2011-11-04,"Being swept away by your fantasies won't be problematic today as long as you remember to fulfill your responsibilities, too. Give yourself permission to explore socially unconventional attractions in the discreet privacy of your own mind. But the lesson of the Moon's visit to your 12th House of Secrets is that you don't need to turn every crazy dream into something real. Some thoughts are better kept to yourself."
taurus,2011-11-04,"Instead of simply continuing your business as normal, it's more exciting today to shake things up and try a different approach. It may be difficult to live up to someone else's expectations of what you should do since you have your own method to explore. Your key planet Venus continues to lure you into unexplored territory as she harmonizes with freedom-loving Uranus. Thankfully, your closest friends should be quite supportive now, so there's no need to hold back."
gemini,2011-11-04,"You don't want so much supervision at work and, thankfully, you stand a good chance to gain more independence today. But dreaming about more freedom doesn't automatically give you the results you desire. You must clearly ask for what you need while being ready to bolster your request with solid logic. Don't forget to keep up with your previous commitments or you'll lose the trust that you already earned."
cancer,2011-11-04,"Typically, you choose the safer road in a relationship, yet these aren't typical times. You're brimming with exciting ideas about how to live your life in a more productive manner. You are eager to try something new and to break the mold in how you usually express yourself. Keep in mind that there's no need to explain your choices to anyone; let them draw their own conclusions based upon your actions alone."
leo,2011-11-04,"You have a chance to demonstrate your special brand of love to a close friend or family member. But this day isn't about buying gifts or making magnanimous gestures; it's about being patient and taking enough time to nurture others. Your ability to encourage their independence and help them move beyond their self-imposed limitations can be of immeasurable benefit. Don't worry about expressing your feelings, for your words can be the catalyst that someone else needs at this time."
virgo,2011-11-04,"A business partnership or friendship can seem a bit weird today if one of you suddenly refuses to play by the regular rules. If someone unexpectedly cancels a social engagement, try not to make a really big deal of it. Rolling with unexpected changes can turn disappointment into enthusiasm. Remain flexible and you might be happily surprised with the outcome."
libra,2011-11-04,"Your key planet Venus is searching for some unusual interpersonal connections at work today as your regular routine is unexpectedly turned upside down. Unfortunately, the more you try to follow a tight schedule now, the more frustrated you become. There's no need to panic while stepping out of your comfort zone. Be true to your spirit and try something radically different."
scorpio,2011-11-04,"Playful Venus in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem is still boldly prancing about with wild and crazy Uranus today. It's very empowering to express yourself in ways that you might usually frown at. You have a sparkle in your eyes that increases your charm, so step up and live your life as if you were free as a bird. Thankfully, you're able to take a risk and spread your wings now without losing anything in the process."
sagittarius,2011-11-04,"Allow space for everyone to bring a different perspective to the table today, even if there's disagreement within the group. Your uncharacteristically narrow field of vision can create more harm than good now, so don't close off your thinking. You might be so caught up in your own viewpoint that you take your argument too far. You'll do fine if you remember that yours isn't the only correct position."
capricorn,2011-11-04,"You are able to pull a rabbit out of a hat today, arriving at an elegant solution to a tricky problem that's left others confused. However, formulating a concrete plan that ensures your success is only half of the deal. The other part requires you to work really hard until all the details are finished. You can actually turn your great idea into reality by following through on what you start."
aquarius,2011-11-04,"The Moon's current visit to your 2nd House of Resources urges you to be careful with your cash, for you could easily find yourself spending more than you have for something you really don't need. Impulsive purchases are not helpful, because you could be overly attracted to the glamor of having certain possessions now. Find meaningful things to do with your friends to reconnect with what's most important."
pisces,2011-11-04,"You may feel like arguing with your co-workers today and doing things your own way just to prove that you're really different from everyone else. Normally, you might provoke a negative judgment when you do something that appears out-of-the box. But now, people look at you with admiration, wondering how you get away with such unconventional behavior so easily. But even your charm is not as simple as it appears; doing the extra work, at least, sets a wonderful example."
aries,2011-11-05,"You may decide that hiding from the world is a good idea today, but it's not possible because others are making demands on your time. You can't just ignore your commitments, so work through your resistance to getting involved with friends and family. Remember, you're a part of a larger community and your lack of participation could have a detrimental impact. Show up as a team player, but give yourself permission to hang back and let someone lead the charge."
taurus,2011-11-05,"You have an idealistic vision about your future and may want to share it with others. However, it may be more advantageous to wait until you have more clarity prior to cluing someone else in on your plans. It's less important to attract anyone's attention than it is to continue developing your thoughts now. Flying beneath the radar is a wise strategy today. Remember, successful ideas take time to evolve and grow."
gemini,2011-11-05,"It's difficult to concentrate today because your boredom and frustration continues to grow. You may resist doing what you promised, but it's probably not a good idea to upset others with your negativity. Thankfully, you can improve your day by changing your attitude. Even if you want something different now, going along with the plan should decrease the stress in the present moment, giving you time to figure out a better long-term strategy."
cancer,2011-11-05,"You may be overconfident about making an important decision today, but your choices could steer you wrong if you don't take all of the facts into consideration. Paying extra careful attention to what others expect can help keep you from going overboard. Listening to your intuition makes sense, as long as you create enough peace and quiet so you can get in touch with your inner wisdom."
leo,2011-11-05,"You are eager to step outside of your normal routine today and network with others to widen your professional horizons. But you're not all business now; this isn't just about making a plan and then executing it. Even if you have chores to handle, don't pass up a chance to deepen an important relationship. It isn't necessary to have answers; revealing your vulnerability can be the key that opens the door to the next level of intimacy."
virgo,2011-11-05,"The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Partners can shift your attention from your work to what's happening with those closest to you. Just make certain that you don't lose touch with your own needs; you can still be sensitive to someone else while taking care of yourself. Juggling your desires with your familial and social commitments takes extra concentration, but a healthy balance is helpful as you navigate your way through the tricky territory of relationships."
libra,2011-11-05,"You may be feeling a bit confused if a situation doesn't unfold according to your plan, yet your optimism continues to lead you on. Unfortunately, your current tendency to gloss over important details can actually impede your progress. Nevertheless, it's still tough for changing circumstances to pull you off course today if you remain committed to fulfilling your obligations. As your thoughts drift away from reality and into the realms of possibility, gently pull them back into the present moment."
scorpio,2011-11-05,"You're ready to deliver on your promises today, and you may even enjoy yourself while being super-productive. However, you may not be able to adhere to an overly rigid schedule because the less freedom you have now, the more you're tempted to escape from the restrictions. Nevertheless, it's still smarter to buckle down and finish your chores before you take some time for yourself. Not only will you feel good about your accomplishments, you'll be able to enjoy yourself without feeling guilty."
sagittarius,2011-11-05,"Your great intentions may not be enough to keep you on the straight and narrow path today as you play out your wanderlust in the realm of fantasies. Thankfully, you should be able to hide your imaginative exploits so no one even realizes you're traveling somewhere else in your mind. However, don't get cocky or you'll need to answer to an unforgiving friend, boss or lover. If you maintain appearances, you might be able to get away with living in both worlds for a little while longer."
capricorn,2011-11-05,"You're often the person that everyone confides in because you seem to be able to hold space for their problems. But others might not even realize that you're going through your own personal struggles now as you attempt to balance your appearance of competence with your increasing lack of certainty. It's useful to periodically reconsider your assumptions, but don't let real questioning turn into self-doubt. You can always contemplate philosophical concerns another day when you have more time on your hands."
aquarius,2011-11-05,"Your dreams may bring an answer to a lingering question, but you must be willing to take sufficient time to explore their symbolism. Even if you're unable to recall the details, your subconscious mind connects you with what's most important now. Your lesson is about how your unbridled imagination helps you to co-create the future. Remember, tomorrow's reality begins with today's thought."
pisces,2011-11-05,"The Moon's visit to your imaginative sign increases your emotional sensitivity. Thankfully, you know how to separate your feelings from the empathic connection you have with others, but this requires constant vigilance. If you practice differentiating your thoughts from those around you, it becomes easier to respond to what's happening without becoming exhausted or emotionally drained. It might be less stressful to keep to yourself until things settle down."
aries,2011-11-06,"Lightning strikes within your brain today, and you are eager to share your brilliant new ideas with anyone who will listen. You are fired up and may be quite pleased with your own ingenuity. Unfortunately, you can lose interest in what you're doing before you really gain traction. Don't worry if nothing reaches fruition; you current thoughts will continue to develop and cycle back in a day or two when you're ready to take them to the next level."
taurus,2011-11-06,"An unexpected shift in your thinking could be precipitated by someone who decides to change shared plans without necessarily telling you. This can be problematic because it impacts the rest of your day, too. You might be resistant to adjusting your schedule to accommodate another person, but it's not wise to be stubborn now. Instead, demonstrate your cooperative spirit by being as flexible as possible. You'll gain more respect if others see you as a team player."
gemini,2011-11-06,"You would like to be acknowledged as a reliable person who is responsible to your friends, family and community. However, you may not be fully committed to walking your talk today. Although others could have high expectations, you might not be interested in paying the price to earn the respect you want. Nevertheless, instead of wasting your time in idle fantasy, show up and play your part as best you can. Even if it's not your first choice, the rewards can still be very satisfying."
cancer,2011-11-06,"You think that you can hear the future calling you today, and you want to get things rolling. But you aren't sure whether or not to take the whole thing seriously. Rest assured the opportunity is worth pursuing, so don't waste time wondering if it's real. It doesn't matter; just pick up the imaginary phone and engage the possibilities."
leo,2011-11-06,"You feel very connected to someone special today, only to suddenly withdraw or be pushed away. If you are rejected, your partner's unexpected behavior could be quite upsetting. Fortunately, it won't take you long to recover, but you may keep your defenses up for a bit to be on the safe side. It's fine to retreat a little, but don't back up so far that you end up isolating yourself from someone you love."
virgo,2011-11-06,"You may be looking forward to breaking out of a rut today, but might let the opportunity to try something new slip away without giving it a shot. Thinking about taking a risk sounds better than it actually is, because you ultimately believe that you will be happier if you stick to what's already familiar. Ironically, avoiding change seems safer, but suppressing your desires could precipitate an unexpected event that you cannot control. Follow your initial instinct and shake things up a bit."
libra,2011-11-06,"A sudden break in your routine catches you off guard today. It may seem as if someone else's refusal to cooperate with you further complicates your day. However, if nothing out of the ordinary happens by evening, stir up some mischief on your own. Ultimately, something must change and if you don't make it happen, the cosmos might just do it for you."
scorpio,2011-11-06,"Even if you feel stuck today, a sudden shift of energy or a burst of enthusiasm can set you into motion. You might attempt to initiate much-needed change, but nothing will come of your efforts if you act prematurely. Wait until you can sense that the time is right. Your patience will be rewarded with a high level of accomplishment, but it might take a few days before you can fully appreciate your success."
sagittarius,2011-11-06,"Although you might try to avoid your responsibilities today, your conscience gnaws at you and reminds you that you must do what you promised. But you may not be coming from a place of passion now; instead you could attempt a half-hearted effort just to get by. Unfortunately, your current detachment can create additional problems if you pretend that everything is okay. Wait it out; inspiration will likely come later in the day."
capricorn,2011-11-06,"You are unable to maintain total control over your own schedule now, for your roommates or family members may not cooperate as you expect. Even if you're upset because your plans fall through today, don't shift the blame to anyone else. No matter how it appears to you, no one is trying to sabotage your efforts. It may come as a surprise, but the cause of your current instability is you."
aquarius,2011-11-06,"You may not be able to turn your plans into reality today because there are some interesting twists and turns that can change the direction of your day. A totally unexpected event might send you into an emotional tailspin if you try to hold on to the past. However, it can prove to be quite exciting if you're ready to launch into your unknown future. Rigid thinking turns small problems into larger ones, so remain open to the surprising possibilities ahead."
pisces,2011-11-06,"You can't hide your feelings forever with the Moon lingering in your sign today. It's as if you are wearing your emotions on your sleeve for everyone to see, even if you try to show your sensitivity by acting kindly to those around you. Nevertheless, your sudden emotional outbreak may surprise others when the Moon enters hotheaded Aries. Don't hold back; expressing yourself in the moment can be just what's needed to encourage someone else to say what's on his or her mind, too."
aries,2011-11-07,"You're all dressed up and ready to go with the Moon in your sign. But your key planet Mars is engaged in a tug of war with otherworldly Neptune that can pull you into a parallel universe. You could slip on a metaphysical banana peel, leaving you uncertain about what to do next. Instead of driving faster to reach your destination, admit that you don't know where you're going. It makes more sense to relax than to waste your energy."
taurus,2011-11-07,"There's no need to work yourself into a state of high anxiety, especially since the conclusions you draw today are likely built upon incorrect assumptions. You cannot trust your senses now because you can't help projecting your fantasies onto the events you perceive, creating a loss of objectivity. Enjoy the movie your mind is directing, but treat the scenes as a work of fiction rather than a documentary. Your view of reality will be clear again in a few days."
gemini,2011-11-07,"You may sound very confident when you share your intentions with your friends or co-workers, but you might actually be covering up your uncertainty. It appears that you're running out of time, but it's not wise to make decisions now just to placate others. Avoid finalizing plans today because confusing Neptune can mess up even the simplest agenda or itinerary for the next few days."
cancer,2011-11-07,"You are charged up and raring to show everyone at work what you can do now that the feisty Aries Moon is in your 10th House of Career. You are highly motivated, believing that little will get in your way of success. But you may lose your concentration and fall victim to your own self-doubt, even if it's not warranted. Ironically, you'll probably accomplish more today if you don't try so hard. A gentle but tenacious approach is a smarter one than coming out ready to set the world on fire."
leo,2011-11-07,"Although combative Mars is still in your dramatic sign until Thursday, you may feel as if you've lost your fighting edge today. It's not that your defensive skills are diminished; it's just that you're more inclined to engage with others in a much subtler manner now. Your adversary may not even realize that you made a move, but you can be so effective as a spiritual warrior that you win a duel without ever drawing your sword."
virgo,2011-11-07,"It's difficult to put your finger on something concrete that's happening today, yet you know that you're on to something significant. You can sense that an energetic shift is drawing near, but you're not quite ready to let go of your current routine yet. Even if you're champing at the bit, hold on a little longer. Waiting isn't easy now, but it's smarter than making the wrong move right out of the gate."
libra,2011-11-07,"You are driven to participate in a group activity today, even if it's just working on a project as part of a team. But it's different from your typical need to relate to others. This is more about losing your identity to a larger cause. Put as much energy as you can into your efforts now, for your need to re-establish your individuality will begin to resurface by the end of the week."
scorpio,2011-11-07,"Your key planet Mars is nearing the end of its visit to your 10th House of Public Responsibility, yet today's opposition to diffusive Neptune may have you wondering about what comes next. Since you have been extremely focused on work, you may be longing for a bit of downtime. Give yourself permission to dream about going on a retreat; you'll be given a chance to turn this wish into a reality soon enough after your work is done."
sagittarius,2011-11-07,"Your love of adventure could get the best of you today as you obsess about going on an amazing journey to an exotic destination. Unfortunately, delusional Neptune is tugging on action-hero Mars, now in your 9th House of Big Ideas. It's healthy to entertain travel fantasies, but don't be disappointed when you realize that you got carried away by confusing your wishes with reality."
capricorn,2011-11-07,"You may feel as if you're on an amusement park ride today -- and you don't like it one bit. You're not happy wasting valuable time because you have too many things to do and you want both feet planted firmly on the ground. You don't want someone else controlling your life, even if it's just for a simple turn on the roller coaster. Nevertheless, practicing flexibility is wiser now than resisting what you cannot change."
aquarius,2011-11-07,"Someone may be giving you directions today, but you're still not sure what you're supposed to do. Perhaps communication is muddled, or, maybe you have ideas about doing things your way. Unfortunately, you can jeopardize a working relationship unless you go out of your way to empathize with others. If you keep in mind that there are multiple paths to any destination, you won't get so frustrated when you realize you've taken a detour."
pisces,2011-11-07,"You may be tired of doing the same thing in the exact same way. You want to try a different approach, but you need to make it clear to everyone exactly what you're doing and why you're doing it. Unfortunately, being bored isn't the reason that your co-workers want to hear, so it might make more sense to keep your motives to yourself until you know that your new method is successful."
aries,2011-11-08,"Although you may be more impatient today than usual, moving too quickly isn't a smart thing to do. You might not feel supported by your closest friends and workmates, especially if you are concerned with fulfilling your own needs. Ultimately, you'll do better if you follow your dreams, even if they conflict with the wishes of others. Proceed slowly and deliberately; acting overly assertive will only add to your problems."
taurus,2011-11-08,"You're motivated to put your dreams into words today, even if you reveal a new facet of your personality in the process. However, your seemingly harmless disclosure can initiate a serious disagreement, and once you start to argue, it may be difficult to find your way back to a more peaceful place. Think twice before sharing your personal secrets on the job, for once they're out in the open you won't be able to take them back."
gemini,2011-11-08,"You would like to set aside your responsibilities today so you can spend time with your friends. Although you're ready to change your plans at the last minute to make something enjoyable happen, it's not a smart idea to leave someone hanging without advanced warning. Consider the negative impact of your actions prior to doing something you might soon regret. Thankfully, being more understanding of others now can deepen your relationships in ways that can't be easily measured."
cancer,2011-11-08,"You are inclined to pull away from someone close to you or ignore a time-honored tradition in your life. You could even feel resentful of anything that restricts your self-expression now. Nevertheless, you don't want to cut your family ties, and you know that you can't just disappear and pretend like no one else exists. Instead of upsetting your personal life, demonstrate your independence by attempting something completely new and different today."
leo,2011-11-08,"You're excited about the prospects of your future, yet obvious obstacles still need to be handled before you can consider yourself successful. You could even feel waves of discouragement today if you focus on how much work there is still left to finish. It's helpful to take a few moments and think about your recent changes, carefully observing where your horizons have grown. However, don't waste precious energy looking back, for time marches on and you must live in the present."
virgo,2011-11-08,"You might be feeling agitated today, yet you're unable to put your finger on the source of your anxiety. You need to tell someone what you are thinking, but blurting out the truth may not be the smartest way to settle your nerves. Instead, try a more diplomatic approach by finding shared beliefs and values, and establishing common ground from there. Remember, confrontation is rarely as productive as cooperation."
libra,2011-11-08,"Someone may be insisting that you make up your mind today, but you don't want to decide because you're able to see both sides of the issue. It's not that you don't care about the outcome; it's just that you can imagine a multitude of possibilities from whatever position you choose. It may require a great deal of determination to remain neutral now, but that's your best strategy until you get a clear answer from within."
scorpio,2011-11-08,"You're inspired to try new approaches to routine jobs today because you're bored of doing repetitive tasks. But acting impulsively with a radical approach to your chores may not be the smartest tactic, even if you want to stir things up. You might feel a lot better in the short run, but your productivity could suffer. The more familiar route makes a lot of sense now as long as you commit to finding an outlet for your restlessness later."
sagittarius,2011-11-08,"The workweek ahead seems longer than usual because the Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Games is enticing you to escape. You're ready to party, but you just can't make plans with so much to do at work. Thankfully, you're able to recognize that this isn't the best time to take off. Just don't project your frustration onto your workmates. Giving yourself a bit of breathing room will allow you to appreciate others more."
capricorn,2011-11-08,"You naturally prefer staying cool, but today your emotions provoke you to jump in and take direct action immediately. Impulsive behavior may be unavoidable now if you project your fear of change onto the current situation. Fortunately, saying what's on your mind can release you from your worries. Embrace the future with an open mind, instead of holding on tightly to the past."
aquarius,2011-11-08,"Your social calendar may be busy enough that you're anticipating a number of exciting activities. Or, perhaps, you're looking forward to doing a project that you've been putting off. Keep in mind that your current optimism may not be enough to keep your plans on schedule. Although a surprise might turn things upside down, your flexible attitude can transform an upset into an adventure."
pisces,2011-11-08,"You could shock your co-workers or friends with your radical behavior today. They may have believed that they knew you well, but now you're full of surprises. Nevertheless, don't spend too much time worrying about how others view your apparent change of values. You don't have to justify your actions to anyone else; just be true to yourself and explain your motives at another time if you wish."
aries,2011-11-09,"Attending to financial matters is a good idea with the Moon's presence in your 2nd House of Money, but you could mistakenly put a lot of effort into an unnecessary task if you don't set clear priorities first. Stopping to consider what is important can turn a frustrating day into one of accomplishment. Concentrate on finishing one meaningful project instead of wasting your time on things that don't really matter."
taurus,2011-11-09,"The Moon's return to your sign brings your feelings to the surface and makes your reactions more transparent to others. It's as if you're wearing your heart on your sleeve for everyone to see today, whether you want to share your emotions or not. But your friends and co-workers might not understand your process, especially if things are more complicated than you wish. Although it's tempting, it's not wise to leave out significant details just because it's convenient in the moment."
gemini,2011-11-09,"You appear to be as steady as a rock today, but this may be a result of you withholding something that you aren't ready to reveal. Normally, you're eager to blurt out whatever you're thinking, but now you're likely to remain quiet. It's okay to wait until you're sure of your feelings; continue developing your ideas for another day or two before divulging your plans."
cancer,2011-11-09,"The Moon's move into your 11th House of Dreams and Wishes can solidify your plans today as you put the pieces of your life together in a practical way, rather than entertaining idle fantasies. Don't be overly concerned if you cannot yet figure out how you will reach your goals. It's likely that your ideas will continue to make more sense over the next couple of days until a concrete plan materializes from the clouds of your imagination."
leo,2011-11-09,"You're not interested in carefully pussyfooting around the truth today. If you see a direct path to your desired destination, you're ready to do nearly anything to get there in a speedy manner. Unfortunately, others may not be so practical, requiring you to slow down to explain your plan point by point. Don't automatically trust a new partnership today because it may be smarter to work by yourself for a while."
virgo,2011-11-09,"You're more comfortable sharing your thoughts now that the Moon is in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Nevertheless, it's easier to talk about the realm of future possibilities rather than what is happening in the present. Stay focused on the horizon; discussing your plans in a very broad sense is more productive today than trying to fill in the details. Waiting until after tomorrow's Full Moon should improve discussions about more specific issues."
libra,2011-11-09,"It may be challenging to untangle mixed signals today, especially if you choose the course of least resistance. Although you have a lot of common sense at your disposal now, you still could be too serious about a current situation. Your desire to be practical conflicts with your feelings of optimism, making you eager to move past your concerns so you can truly enjoy the good times ahead. However, it's still smarter to concentrate on the present moment while taking one step at a time."
scorpio,2011-11-09,"You're ready to sink deeper into your subconscious as you explore the current possibilities in your life. But you could run into resistance if you are expecting a close friend to participate with you on this metaphysical journey. Others may be quick to express their willingness to join you, but they might withdraw before the energy gets intense. Don't worry; you're better off traveling in these imaginative realms by yourself, anyway. Your friends will just have to wait to hear about your adventures when you return."
sagittarius,2011-11-09,The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Routine can bring you an opportunity to think about your physical well-being and do something proactive to improve your health. Making small changes to your diet or exercise program could have positive consequences now as long as you don't alter too much too fast. Small steps that lead to enduring change are more useful than grandiose gestures that do not last more than a day or two.
capricorn,2011-11-09,"You're riding on a highly creative wave today as the Moon moves through your 5th House of Self-Expression. Fortunately, she is in practical Taurus, enabling you to set a sustainable pace in the morning and then stick with it until you finish your tasks. Thankfully, you'll probably have time for play, too, making this a relatively pleasant day. Nevertheless, the Moon's conjunction with expansive Jupiter tempts you to take on more than you can complete, so don't say yes unless you really mean it."
aquarius,2011-11-09,"You are likely to receive much-needed support from family members and close friends now that the Moon is in your 4th House of Roots. Although their generosity can make your life easier, the assistance might not be what you need -- even if others mean well. If you feel confined by someone meddling in your affairs, express your concerns as kindly as possible. Count your blessings; there's no need to make your life more complicated by offending your allies."
pisces,2011-11-09,"You can be swept off your feet by other people's agendas today because you think they need your help. Unfortunately, you might be left feeling like your assistance wasn't very useful at all. And on top of that, your own work could remain unfinished. However, if you establish clear boundaries so you can fulfill your responsibilities early in the day, you'll feel better about jumping in to support someone else."
aries,2011-11-10,"Your desire to experience pleasure today could make you lazy, especially if you think that your fantasies are out of reach. Although you might be content to dream about fun activities, you also realize that your window of opportunity is closing fast. Instead of accepting whatever comes your way now, decide what you want and pursue satisfaction while the odds are still in your favor."
taurus,2011-11-10,"Today's Full Moon in your sensual sign puts you in touch with your feelings, even if they tug at you from different directions. Typically, you prefer being sure about what you are doing, but you're willing to tolerate a bit more uncertainty now. Even if your current circumstances are topsy-turvy, you can still rely on your inner compass to guide you through the day."
gemini,2011-11-10,"Everything seems less complicated than it actually is today, and you may not realize the complexities that are hiding beneath the surface. The placid Taurus Full Moon agitates your 12th House of Secrets, reminding you to keep your concerns to yourself. Thankfully, you're able to handle yourself well in the tricky cosmic currents. Remember, your goal is to maintain balance, rather than to reach a specific destination."
cancer,2011-11-10,"You may think that your friends or colleagues are acting in a stubborn manner and coaxing you to step outside of your comfort zone when the Full Moon illuminates your 11th House of Teamwork. Even if you resist at first, you'll ultimately relinquish control to the tides of change. Once you accept that you can't prevent inevitable change, your worries can transform into exhilaration, removing the barriers between you and the rest of the group."
leo,2011-11-10,"Impulsive Mars is spending his last day in your fixed sign, and you want to squeeze every last drop of excitement out of whatever's happening. However, you can be quite stubborn as the bullheaded Taurus Full Moon illuminates your public 10th house. Unfortunately, circumstances will still require you to change to your plan. Thankfully, your tension can be alleviated by discussing your dilemma with someone you trust."
virgo,2011-11-10,"Someone may be withholding information from you, leading you to make a commitment based on incomplete data. Needless to say, you could be very upset when you learn the truth. Even if your plans don't unfold according to your expectations, it's not wise to take your frustrations out on anyone else. Rather than concentrating on what went wrong, save the day by focusing on the possibilities that still lay ahead."
libra,2011-11-10,"It isn't easy to unwind today because a simple financial decision can escalate into a crisis that involves a close friend or business partner. But your attempts to fix the problem only make it worse as the Full Moon in your 8th House of Shared Resources encourages you to take responsibility for a choice that's not really yours to make. Fortunately, a strategy based on cooperation, rather than control, should help to restore the peace."
scorpio,2011-11-10,"Today's Full Moon spotlights your 7th House of Partners, emphasizing your professional and personal relationships. However, stressful lunar aspects can turn a little misunderstanding into a major disagreement. Instead of going out of your way to drive home your point, change your tactics and do whatever you can to get along with others. Solutions will begin to flow once the erratic emotional energy has settled."
sagittarius,2011-11-10,"The hectic pace of your day can wear you out with so many demands at work that require your immediate attention. However, reacting quickly isn't as useful as you think, since you could waste a lot of energy by heading off in a wrong direction. If you want to do well, slow down and be sure you stay on track or you'll just end up spinning your wheels without accomplishing what you set out to do."
capricorn,2011-11-10,"The pragmatic Taurus Full Moon fills your 5th House of Play, reminding you to enjoy yourself while doing your chores. However, it's easy to misread a situation on the job today, sending you on a tiring wild goose chase. But even if your plan is unsuccessful, don't blame anyone else. Arguments don't increase your productivity, and only generate bad feelings. Taking the pressure off of others makes the best of the stressful situation."
aquarius,2011-11-10,"Hot-tempered Mars in your 7th House of Others encourages you to express your feelings, but a conversation about an important subject might not go as smoothly as you prefer. Although you may have specific goals, someone else has a very different agenda for you now. Instead of fighting over unimportant details, be willing to find common ground. A group of like-minded people can accomplish a lot more now than a lone ranger."
pisces,2011-11-10,"The rest of the world appears to be speeding up, yet your wise strategy is to take several deep breaths and slow down. Today's steadfast Taurus Full Moon highlights your 3rd House of Communication, infusing your words with common sense. Although an unexpected change of plans could be upsetting at first, hold on to your dreams of the best possible outcome. Your consistent affirmations will go a long way toward improving your day."
aries,2011-11-11,"You might want to take some time off today, but you could end up much busier than expected. It's tempting to kick back in the morning, but it's likely that you'll pay a price if you fall behind on your work. Procrastination isn't a good idea now; turn your day around by working hard first and then making time to pursue your own interests after you fulfill your responsibilities."
taurus,2011-11-11,"Your emotions may still be close to the surface today, but you probably feel calmer than you did yesterday. It's easier to take things in stride now, even if your feelings are confusing. However, you might receive information later in the day that conflicts with what you thought was true. Instead of being overly concerned about the contrary stories, entertain all possibilities as the truth until the facts sort themselves out."
gemini,2011-11-11,"Someone could be working to block your progress, but the Moon's shift into facile Gemini this afternoon allows you to smoothly sidestep most of the resistance. Don't overreact before you know what's going on, because you could inadvertently turn a figment of your imagination into something real by giving it too much attention today. Instead, just continue doing your best and let the situation develop on its own."
cancer,2011-11-11,"Getting into a flow of creativity feels good today, even if you're content to work behind the scenes. You may be producing something wonderful, but you don't necessarily want others to see what you're doing yet. Continue along your path without worrying about what anyone else thinks of your current endeavors. You'll receive the recognition you deserve later on when it really matters."
leo,2011-11-11,"Tensions begin to ease, leaving you with the desire to integrate your feelings more completely into your whole life, rather than having them neatly tied up in a box. You may be afraid that others won't understand your actions, leading you to pull back a little at this time. Although you must function within your family or community, it's more important to acknowledge what is in your heart, no matter how anyone else judges you."
virgo,2011-11-11,"You may feel a jolt of energy now that active Mars is spending his first full day in your sign. Others think you're doing well because they can't help but notice your ""I can do it"" attitude. However, issues that are out of everyone else's sight can still negatively impact your day if you try to avoid your emotions. Instead of pretending that you are fine today, show real courage and reveal your vulnerability to someone you trust."
libra,2011-11-11,"A bit of worry could lurk behind your easy smile today, but your self-doubt may vanish when the Moon enters cavalier Sagittarius and your 9th House of Big Ideas this afternoon. You don't even need to change anything, although you might feel as if your timing is off if you don't react immediately. The best way to overcome your uncertainty is to remember that the details may not be as significant as they seem. There's no need to get hung up with what can go wrong if you stick to the simplicity of the present moment."
scorpio,2011-11-11,"You're able to breathe much easier now as yesterday's Full Moon intensity starts to wane. Your feelings were trapped behind a dam and now the waters are flowing again. Nevertheless, don't gloss over any residual blocked feelings because bringing them into awareness will ultimately help you reach satisfaction. Just remember to let go of the past once the stuck energy is moving or you won't be able to swim into the future."
sagittarius,2011-11-11,"You might feel as if you're bouncing around in a sea of intense forces that you cannot control. You could fritter away time and energy by trying to take charge of your life today, but a smarter tactic is to soften your position and temporarily let go of your agenda. However, you don't need to alter your overall direction; just lessen the pressure by demonstrating your trust in the wisdom of the cosmos."
capricorn,2011-11-11,"You might be able to find your groove and accomplish a great deal today while also enjoying yourself. Although your pace is steady and your resolve is unwavering, social connections at work can become more meaningful than your job itself. Don't let any important feelings slip into denial; be vigilant about keeping all communications clear and above board. Hiding the truth now can multiply problems later, so share your concerns and then let them go."
aquarius,2011-11-11,"Events at work can take an odd detour that ultimately reveals a whole new perspective. It doesn't matter if you can't logically figure out how all the disparate pieces fit into place, since more is going on than is apparent on the surface. Although maintaining a flexible attitude isn't always easy for you -- especially when you are sure that you know the truth -- today it holds the key to your happiness."
pisces,2011-11-11,"Your commitment to work may be so over the top now that it becomes counterproductive. Don't take yourself so seriously today, especially if you really believe that you have no time at all for any frivolous activities. Ironically, you'll accomplish more if you loosen up and focus some of your attention on maintaining healthy relationships away from your place of employment. It's true: all work and no play makes Johnny (or Susie) a dull boy (or girl)."
aries,2011-11-12,"You could work yourself into a state of excitement today by following one interesting distraction after another. Although you would be happily amused if you were free to flit from one task to the next without completing what you start, circumstances could close in on you quickly, anyhow. You won't be thrilled if your boss arrives to pressure you to finish one project before you head off to something else. Be responsible and do things right the first time around, and then no one will have a valid reason to question your intentions or criticize your work."
taurus,2011-11-12,"You might glide along smoothly today, as if you know just what to do in order to be productive. However, a surprising turn of events may stir self-doubt about your recent choices. Although you can't undo what you did in the past, you can bring your focus back to the present. You should be able to maintain your current delivery schedule if you don't waste time questioning your previous performance."
gemini,2011-11-12,"Your buzz factor is extremely high today and you're quite excited about your future prospects. However, bouncing off walls isn't necessarily conducive to getting a lot accomplished, even if you like how it feels. Your exuberance might create problems unless you allow extra time to complete your agenda. Unfortunately, you could make too many plans and promise too much all at once. Pace yourself so you can sustain your output until the energy settles."
cancer,2011-11-12,"Your fantasies may be more active than anyone realizes, but that's because you're able to balance them with actual productivity. Keeping your dreams to yourself helps you convince others that your feet are firmly planted on the ground when, in fact, you might be soaring in your imagination. Nevertheless, a sudden change in circumstances could reveal your secret life. There's no reason to hide the truth since the outcome is likely to be a positive one."
leo,2011-11-12,"You can find your work groove today and should end up feeling great about your accomplishments. Thankfully, whatever you do now has a positive impact on your future. However, everything isn't as light and breezy as it seems. Serious issues must be addressed and the sooner you face them the better. Just remember that you might overreact, so ask your friends or colleagues for their advice before you fly off the handle and say something you regret."
virgo,2011-11-12,"You are motivated to act in a pragmatic and decisive manner, but it's difficult to make practical use of your thoughts today. You might even feel as if you're walking on a cushion of air, making it nearly impossible to get traction. Instead of trying to force results, give yourself permission to explore a variety of options without choosing one course of action. You can decide on your strategy when you land back on earth in a day or two."
libra,2011-11-12,"Your explorations into the more serious side of life aren't over yet, but you may want to have some guilt-free fun today. You might even think that you're making up for lost time by reconnecting with your inner child or your adult adventurer. Just be aware that you won't be able to avoid the real issues in your life that still need resolution. Don't be impatient; the long-term changes you seek will take a while to unfold."
scorpio,2011-11-12,"You want to release pent-up tension by doing something to get your adrenaline flowing. You're drawn toward acting out your feelings physically today, but it's wiser to use this time to reconnect with your spiritual center. Instead of distracting yourself with social activities or strenuous exercise, consider spending time alone with your thoughts. Observe how you become attached to new outcomes as your moods change, even when you're not doing anything at all."
sagittarius,2011-11-12,"Everyone appears more interesting today, but your connections with others may be limited to a superficial basis. Although you're fully capable of building profound relationships, it's more fun now to drop in and out of a discussion as your attention waxes and wanes. Don't judge yourself harshly if your energy is scattered because you'll have plenty of time to dig deeper in a few days."
capricorn,2011-11-12,"Although fascinating people and intelligent conversations may fill your day, it's difficult to simply enjoy your surroundings. You may be distracted by your fear of being stuck in a situation that demands more of your time than you want to give. Honor that part of you that wants to explore a variety of interests now. There's nothing wrong with remaining open to what the world has to offer, instead of letting circumstances or the needs of others define your day."
aquarius,2011-11-12,"A playful interlude with a friend or lover may be just the thing you need today in order to regain a healthy perspective on life. Even if you're busy with work or if you have lots of chores to do, don't pass up an opportunity to pursue pleasure. Remember, you can always fulfill your responsibilities tomorrow with a big smile on your face and a bounce to your step."
pisces,2011-11-12,"Relationships may be a source of tension now, especially if someone is trying to extract a commitment from you that you're not ready to give. If fears about a negative outcome begin to surface, go ahead and share your concerns with your friend or partner. However, don't shift the discussion to hypothetical questions about the future. Instead of worrying about meeting anyone else's expectations, your best strategy is to keep bringing your thoughts back to what you're feeling in the present moment."
aries,2011-11-13,"You have a lot on your plate today and could be rather busy just trying to keep up with everything. However, you might not have much to show for your efforts by the end of the day. Even if you have a viable plan in place, one distraction after another lures you away from your work. But there's no reason to think that frustration will hijack your day; simply accept the premise that disruptions bring important lessons you need to learn before you can move on."
taurus,2011-11-13,"You might expect your life to be easier as your feelings settle down, but it's challenging to find a place quiet enough to hear your own thoughts today. You need to establish limits with an emotionally intense acquaintance, even if you don't want to get involved. Fortunately, you can ultimately be effective in getting what you want if you choose your words carefully and stay focused on the message at hand."
gemini,2011-11-13,"The Moon is still in your busy sign today, drawing you right into the center of an emotional storm. You may feel very clever now, but don't assume that everyone thinks that you're funny. Others could perceive your playful antics as bothersome, even if you mean no harm. Fortunately, you can avoid making trouble by tempering your emotions and acknowledging that there are times to act appropriately serious."
cancer,2011-11-13,"Others may be talking behind your back today -- or, at least, that's how it appears -- but your own desire to keep secrets can fuel your suspicions. The issue isn't whether you are the subject of idle gossip, since you can't control what anyone else says, anyway. But your reaction to the current situation has an immediate impact, making it advisable now to keep all your communications clear and concise on your end. Respond to what you truly know and not what you only imagine."
leo,2011-11-13,"You may feel as if you are an integral part of a social network, especially if you are reconnecting with old friends. It might be overwhelming at first, but it should grow easier to handle all the new information you now receive. It's a serious mistake to assume you must understand everything right away. There's no hurry; instead, be open to the changing flow and see where it takes you."
virgo,2011-11-13,"Your desire to be objective isn't very successful today because even your logical thoughts have strong feelings attached to them. Although you may try to rein your emotions back in, they just seem to slip out of control again. This can become a problem, especially if you're trying to keep your personal opinions out of the way. Don't worry about hiding what's important; it's more useful to show up and be your authentic self."
libra,2011-11-13,"You may feel a bit flighty today, making it difficult for someone to pin you down about an important matter. However your current need for independence now isn't about avoiding commitments. To the contrary, you want to express yourself as best you can. But you could be so eager to please that you're ready to agree to someone else's plan, even if your heart isn't into it. Don't say yes to anyone if doing so gets in the way of your own personal goals."
scorpio,2011-11-13,"Once you make up your mind, no one will be able to talk you out of your decision. You are ready to stand behind your commitment today, making you a formidable opponent if your judgment is questioned. Nevertheless, your stubbornness can be misleading because you're interested in discovering what's real, and are not as close-minded as you sound. Back up your penchant for the truth by showing your intellectual flexibility when it's appropriate."
sagittarius,2011-11-13,"You enjoy taking a sweeping philosophical approach to life, but today's data-gathering Gemini Moon prompts your interest in just about everything. Unfortunately, you might appear scattered as your attention jumps from one fascinating topic to another. But the Sun's presence in your 12th House of Soul Consciousness reveals an intense inner world in contrast to your outer appearance. Slow down and choose a spiritual path now, since it can lift you out of the mundane world and take you to a more magical space."
capricorn,2011-11-13,"Sticking to your regular Sunday routine isn't the smartest idea, since you probably won't be satisfied doing things the same way you did them last week. Introducing variety to your schedule enables you to feel more optimistic, but keep in mind that your fresh approach isn't necessarily better or more efficient. Being a little less productive for once is a small price to pay for improving your emotional health."
aquarius,2011-11-13,"You understand your role in your family or community, even if complicated circumstances are at play. But you might disagree with the group agenda now, which motivates you to openly question the wisdom of others. Be careful; it's a good idea to leave a little wiggle room for yourself. No one appreciates a know-it-all, so allow enough time for the unheard voices to offer their valuable input, too. You might be surprised at what you can learn if you stop talking long enough to listen."
pisces,2011-11-13,"The dualistic Gemini Moon traveling through your 9th House of Big Ideas encourages you to be of two minds. You are easily influenced by those closest to you, but have difficulty following through on any single thought. However, you also have your own long-term goals and aren't willing to compromise. It helps if you consciously create your life by balancing interactions in the present moment with your dreams for the future."
aries,2011-11-14,"Although you might be strongly attached to someone special, it's still difficult for you to express your desires today unless you feel emotionally safe. You may be overly concerned that your needs are not supported by the current situation, leading you to keep quiet about them. Unfortunately, remaining silent isn't a viable strategy since it will be apparent that you're holding something back. Ultimately, it isn't what you choose to share that's problematic now; it's how you deliver the message that counts."
taurus,2011-11-14,"You're attracted to something or someone who pushes against your boundaries today, but you're hesitant to act on your feelings. You might think that you shouldn't step outside your comfort zone and therefore deny what you actually like. Don't try to rationalize your feelings; you aren't required to justify your tastes to anyone. It's time for you to live your own life without worrying about the expectations of others."
gemini,2011-11-14,"You don't necessarily like the thought of slowing down, but acting responsibly to get what you want could keep you in one place for a while. You won't be satisfied if you just run off to the next event, so stop and face the music now. Fortunately, your fears are more challenging than what will actually happen. Sink into the messy realm of feelings today; navigating watery emotional spaces isn't your natural preference, but it's essential to your spiritual well-being."
cancer,2011-11-14,"A difference of opinion that has bothered you for a while reaches a critical stage today, leaving you nowhere to go with your feelings. Your emotional sensitivity contributes to the turmoil, but losing your temper might seem like the only way to clear the air of unexpressed emotions. A smarter strategy is to express your frustrations before they reach the boiling point. Sharing what's in your heart can help to bring down your walls and amplify the love that's already in your life."
leo,2011-11-14,"Your grand gestures today may reveal more than you want, especially if you're feeling a bit vulnerable. Unfortunately, your magnanimity won't likely express your true emotions now. You still might need to go through the motions of sharing your feelings. Remember, once you have worked through your stress, you should be able to reclaim your power by simply being yourself."
virgo,2011-11-14,"You're not interested in burdening any of your friends, but it might be smarter to let them know what you've been dealing with, rather than keeping everything to yourself. Don't go looking for sympathy; just accept responsibility for your place in life and keep working to manifest your dreams. Instead of being negative or fearful, just take the time to catch up with everyone and then move on."
libra,2011-11-14,"You could run into your share of difficult emotions as you think about the tough issues that are still ahead of you. Luckily, you may have already started to take responsibility for your future. But don't fall into the trap of believing that you have to fix everything at once. Although you still have time, it will be easier to deal with the complications ahead if you don't ignore the inevitable for too long."
scorpio,2011-11-14,"Although your goals may be coming into focus, it still seems as if the road to your future is being blocked by the past. Old fears may resurface today when you realize that nothing will change until you shift your own attitude. This might not be a reassuring thought, especially if you focus on the obstacles instead of your dreams. Have faith; the significant progress you've already made will continue to grow more evident in the days ahead."
sagittarius,2011-11-14,"A wave of uncertainty flows into your life today, intensifying your emotions and reminding you to stop running around long enough to process your feelings. But you might worry that others will question your effectiveness. Fortunately, you haven't lost your edge; you're just moving through a phase of inner growth that doesn't mix well with your outgoing style. Regardless of what anyone else thinks, breaking away for meditation and contemplation can be exactly what's needed to get back in the groove."
capricorn,2011-11-14,"Today's schedule doesn't necessarily allow time for an emotional melodrama, so you'll probably try to keep your feelings all to yourself. Unfortunately, your strategy could fall apart if someone involves you in the same kind of drama that you're attempting to avoid. Although you're ready to run, keep your heart and mind open to what you're being shown now rather than exhausting yourself resisting an important lesson."
aquarius,2011-11-14,"Your optimism could collide with reality today, but you might not be ready to face a lingering issue head-on. The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Employment challenges you to stay objective at work because you have definite opinions about nearly everything. Resistance from friends or co-workers is tiring, but also serves to clarify your thinking now. Thankfully, the truth can help dissipate your fear and bring a newfound freedom from the past."
pisces,2011-11-14,"Even if you're worried about the wisdom of a recent choice, you're also optimistic that things are improving. Fortunately, you can be very patient now, even if your emotions are all over the place. It's hard to tell if you're overreacting or if the residual negativity you're feeling is actually real. Be smart and wait a few days before changing your game plan. In the meantime, concentrate on the best possible outcome instead of stressing about the past."
aries,2011-11-15,"Patience may be considered a virtue, but it's not an easy one for someone as impulsive as you. Thankfully, you're more receptive to learning about the benefits of waiting when the Moon is in tenacious Cancer. You will be able to enjoy the present moment even more if you don't push too hard. There's no need to struggle today; a current issue will reach fruition when it's ready and not necessarily when you think it should."
taurus,2011-11-15,Your ruling planet Venus is flying high in idealistic Sagittarius these days and her quintile to imaginative Neptune today can lure you into believing that your fantasies are true. But you might have a gnawing suspicion that something is off and may be hesitant to make a commitment based solely on your feelings. Listen to your internal voice of reason because it offers a healthy balance to pursuing unrealistic dreams.
gemini,2011-11-15,"Relationships are at the forefront of your thinking today as the emotional Cancer Moon misaligns with thoughtful Mercury in your 7th House of Others. However, it's not beneficial to automatically place someone else's needs ahead of yours. Of course, unselfish acts of love can be emotionally transformative, but not if you're avoiding an important issue of your own that needs attention now. Taking care of yourself first enables you to give someone special a more meaningful gift later."
cancer,2011-11-15,"Your actions are motivated by your need to make good feelings last longer now that the Moon is in your nurturing sign. But you might feel as if everything is moving along too quickly for your taste, prompting you to find ways to slow down. Remember, time is on your side; be patient and pay attention to what's happening in the present moment rather than trying to manipulate events in order to get what you want."
leo,2011-11-15,"You may feel like the eye of a hurricane today; even if storms of change are circling around you, you still manage to remain calm and continue on your path. But now you might need to make several adjustments to your plan as you respond to the fluctuating circumstances. Even if you get caught up in the craziness of the moment, your positive attitude will help you stay on track."
virgo,2011-11-15,"Your social life seems to be in turmoil today as the cautious Cancer Moon moves through your 11th House of Friends. However, you may be overly distracted by your fear of not fitting in. Rather than trying to alter your behavior to meet other people's expectations, consider curtailing some of your superfluous activities. A bit of rest and relaxation will have a more positive impact on your life than a few hours of meaningless chatter."
libra,2011-11-15,"Your ruling planet Venus reminds you of the importance of your dreams today as she creates a magical quintile with elusive Neptune. Sometimes it's not healthy to get lost in fantasies, but now they can be a source of solace and even inspiration. However, don't expect all your wishes to come true; instead, seek satisfaction in what's real while also honoring your ideas about an ideal future."
scorpio,2011-11-15,"Your feelings are growing in intensity now, but others might not notice anything different about you. This is not because of a shortcoming in anyone else; it's a result of your skill in hiding your feelings today. Keeping quiet for another day may be long enough to give you the time needed to untangle your complex desires. It's better to make a rational decision than one based on an impulsive reaction."
sagittarius,2011-11-15,"The security-conscious Cancer Moon challenges you to balance your wanderlust with your current need for security. You may have exciting ideas about your possible adventures during the next few weeks, but you might also be feeling quite exhausted. Suddenly, staying home could sound more appealing than going anywhere. Instead of trying to reconcile your conflicting desires, make enough room in your schedule for both rest and play."
capricorn,2011-11-15,"Your social and career ambitions are extremely important to you, but sometimes it's useful to set your goals aside for a while. Your ruling planet Saturn forms an otherworldly septile to mental Mercury today, enabling you to retreat and enjoy yourself instead of worrying about getting ahead. It's okay to forget about your obligations for just a little while. Your responsibilities aren't going anywhere; but you'll feel rejuvenated and better equipped to tackle your work after you return from a playful excursion."
aquarius,2011-11-15,"You are comfortable with your logical approach to life, even if others think you're emotionally aloof or just plain weird. Ironically, you might not be able to avoid your feelings today, even if you prefer to present a cool and carefree image. Don't resist the strong emotional currents as your changing moods draw you out of your head and into your body. Showing your vulnerability could actually strengthen your connection with someone you love."
pisces,2011-11-15,"You're in touch with your feelings, yet you're quite reserved today when it comes to expressing them. Maybe you don't want to burden a friend with your current situation or, perhaps, you're fearful of being rejected. Either way, inaccurate assumptions could stand between you and your happiness. Don't fall victim to your own negativity now. If you muster up enough courage to ask for what you need, you might be pleasantly surprised with what happens."
aries,2011-11-16,"You're eager to shout your message from the top of the mountain or proudly strut your stuff to anyone who will watch. However, you would be wise to temper your actions since everything you do now is infused with your excessive enthusiasm. Acting with good intentions is always admirable, but you could end up making things worse if you overstate your case today."
taurus,2011-11-16,"You are unable to simply walk out on your responsibilities today, but you might be able to escape with just doing the bare minimum. You don't have anything to prove to anyone now and your deadlines may be more flexible than you think. You'll feel better if you treat yourself to some rest and relaxation, instead of pushing yourself for no logical reason. Remember, you can always complete your work tomorrow."
gemini,2011-11-16,You can tell that things are changing for the better now that the pace of your life is picking up again. Your optimism has returned and you're ready to hit the ground running. Doing anything today is smarter than holding on to the status quo. Don't be afraid to make a bit of mischief by mixing up work and play. But don't just talk about it; get out and make something happen.
cancer,2011-11-16,"Although you are often careful about how you spend your time, this is a great day to hang out with your friends or colleagues. You might feel a bit lazier than usual today, but ironically, you have more physical stamina now than you think. Your energy will become more apparent to you once you get moving, so don't sit around dreaming about all the possibilities. Ultimately, it doesn't really matter what you do as long as you connect with others when you have the opportunity to do so."
leo,2011-11-16,"Your co-workers seem to need your support today, and, thankfully, you can be there for them even if you wish that you didn't always need to play the role of the hero. The Moon's return to your expressive sign encourages you to show your positive side, but you might prefer that others share in the leadership responsibilities more than they do. Although you are capable of supplying your shoulder for your friends to lean on, you have your own agenda, too. Don't worry; you'll have time for yourself soon enough."
virgo,2011-11-16,"This can be a magical day for you as the Moon enters your spiritual 12th House, encouraging you to slip away unnoticed. Make time for a quiet meditation or a long walk; doing something physical now is good for your soul, while also giving you enough time to sort out your options and make a sensible plan. Fortunately, paying attention to your needs should put a big smile on your face today."
libra,2011-11-16,"Your life gets even busier as the expressive Leo Moon enters your social 11th house. However, you might not want to be so involved with others because you have your own schedule to manage. Even if you're annoyed that your friends are taking up too much of your time, let your dreams lift you out of the present moment and into the future. Focusing on the potential ahead will go a long way to reducing your present frustration."
scorpio,2011-11-16,You're at the top of your game as the proud Leo Moon visits your 10th House of Status today. But this isn't a day to rest on previous accomplishments because there is still work to be done and unrealized opportunities just around the next corner. Don't waste your time drifting in Fantasyland; continue to shine your light so will receive the recognition that you deserve.
sagittarius,2011-11-16,"You have plenty of great ideas today and, fortunately, the energy to turn some of them into reality. Although you might not be quite as charmed as King Midas, you could create fantastic opportunities everywhere you go. Your high spirits can inspire your co-workers to support you, even if your vision seems overly ambitious. Don't let this bountiful day pass without moving ahead on your next journey."
capricorn,2011-11-16,"You don't need to be in the spotlight today because you're more concerned with achieving tangible results than with getting attention. However, expressing your enthusiasm may place you on center stage, anyhow. No matter what happens, don't take your eyes off your goal. As long as you remain focused, it really doesn't matter whether or not others notice what you're doing yet."
aquarius,2011-11-16,"It's challenging to keep on track, for the Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships means that the actions of others have a profound impact on you today. Even if you have a clear idea of where you're going, many of the variables depend on those around you. If your focus shifts away from your original goal, firmly pull yourself back to center. Try not to change direction now; maintaining your current course is your smartest strategy."
pisces,2011-11-16,"You might lose your cool if your friend or a co-worker acts in an overly aggressive manner today. You are tempted to fight back by turning a minor detail into a big deal just to validate your sense of power. Unfortunately, this tactic leads to a dead end because no one comes out a winner if anyone loses. Avoid confrontation while demonstrating your truth through clear and decisive action."
aries,2011-11-17,"It doesn't matter what you have to do today because you're in the mood to play rather than work. Instead of heading into the office, you would rather be off doing your own thing. Your creative potential is high now but you may feel as if you need to be less restricted in order to express what's in your heart. Don't wait for circumstances to change; make the best of what you have in the present moment."
taurus,2011-11-17,"You feel as if you deserve to be acknowledged and even appreciated by those close to you, yet you're not sure that you want to share your feelings today. Your mixed messages make it challenging for others to connect with you. It's really your choice; if you take a leap and reveal what's in your heart, you can create a fertile environment for intimacy. Push back against your resistance by expressing your real intentions, even if it makes you uncomfortable. The likelihood of success makes this less of a gamble than you think."
gemini,2011-11-17,"You have a variety of things that you want to do today, but it's easy to stack up one too many activities for such a limited amount of time. Your day only grows more complex if you are unable to say no. Although you may be looking forward to fun, your life becomes complicated if you're so busy that you can't give anything the attention it deserves. Fortunately, lightening up your calendar should have a positive impact on the rest of your week."
cancer,2011-11-17,"Your usual need for emotional safety might not serve you well today, making this a smart time to take a risk in the outer world. Although breaking out of your shell is probably the best thing you can do, overextending yourself could make you so uncomfortable that you run back to the seclusion of your private world. Instead, take a few methodical steps into your journey; start small and grow into your new strategy so you won't have to retreat."
leo,2011-11-17,"Although the Moon's visit to your lively sign increases the activity level of your day, don't take on so much that you burn yourself out before you're ready to call it quits. However, doing too little can leave you feeling frustrated since you have so many things you want to accomplish. A more constructive approach is to concentrate on the most crucial tasks, leaving the other ones for another day."
virgo,2011-11-17,"You may have set your goals so high for today that you might be wise to cancel a few activities so you can recharge your batteries instead of running out of energy. You are uncharacteristically resistant to making a list of exactly what you want to do because you want some flexibility to relax. Nevertheless, it's still best to give some structure to your day; ultimately setting a schedule will open up more time than making it up as you go along."
libra,2011-11-17,"Your day may start on a rough note, but thankfully it improves through the afternoon and evening. You might want to take it easy, but hard work now brings bountiful rewards. Instead of ignoring your obligations as a team player today, fulfill your promises before you head off to enjoy yourself. Fortunately, your efforts will pay off many times over, making you glad that you took the more responsible path."
scorpio,2011-11-17,"Trusting your intuition is your best strategy today, even if you're unable to rationally explain how you arrived at your decision. Although you have a healthy balance between your career objectives and your personal values, you still might need to perform tasks you would rather leave behind. But don't be overly concerned if your obligations don't align with your long-term goals now because you might not be able to see your true trajectory from your current point of view."
sagittarius,2011-11-17,"While you know that practical concerns should be considered when making plans for your future, you're tired of placing limits on yourself. You are tempted to ignore the current circumstances and just do as you please; however, you cannot avoid the reality of the present situation at work. Thankfully, after you finish assessing your current condition, you should be able to move ahead with a much clearer view of the future."
capricorn,2011-11-17,"You're not a stranger to hard work, yet you might talk about everything you want to do instead of actually doing it today. You are motivated by a strong desire to create a life of purpose, but your higher ideals don't necessarily support the tasks that you need to complete. Procrastination doesn't work in your favor because you still must meet your obligations. Instead of wasting time plotting your escape, just bite the bullet now and finish the job before doing anything else."
aquarius,2011-11-17,"You like the idea of working by yourself, but the Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners makes it difficult to avoid others. You might become obsessive about evading someone you don't want to see today, even if there's no easy escape. Fortunately, once you are engaged in a social situation, you could quickly forget about your previous resistance. Make it easier on yourself by practicing flexibility earlier in the day instead of waiting for circumstances to force you to change your mind."
pisces,2011-11-17,"You may be unusually self-critical as you compare your performance at work to your original objectives. Or you might be unforgiving with a co-worker who isn't holding up his or her end of the deal. Although your inclination is to be brutally honest today, this strategy could quickly turn a minor problem into a major event. You don't need to say everything you feel now unless you can show extra kindness when stating your point of view."
aries,2011-11-18,"You may believe that no one should tell you what to do today. You might even feel like doing the opposite of what everyone expects, but this arrogant attitude won't lead to anything positive. It's smarter to take time to ask what others think and then listen carefully to what they say. There's nothing wrong with having goals of your own as long as you temper your actions so you won't upset your best allies."
taurus,2011-11-18,"Sometimes you can be stubborn without even realizing that you have dug your heels into the ground. However, you know exactly what you're doing today and you most likely have a good reason to hold on to your position. But it still can be a challenge to justify your behavior now because your intense emotions prompt you to be overly defensive. Even if you won't change your mind, be aware that you'll have a better chance of getting what you want if you try to be more flexible in your thinking."
gemini,2011-11-18,"Your need to interact with other people at work today may be blocked by circumstances that appear to be beyond your control. However, you can have a positive effect on your day by envisioning your ideal future instead of concentrating on your current frustrations. A simple shift of focus could alleviate the pressure and prevent rash behavior on your part. Extreme reactions aren't necessary; moderation improves your chances to achieve satisfaction."
cancer,2011-11-18,"The people in your immediate environment could be so pushy today that you want to resist following their agenda. Unfortunately, passive-aggressive behavior isn't conducive to getting what you want; neither is losing your temper. Nevertheless, revealing your feelings can be helpful if you present them in a non-judgmental way. Expressing yourself without blaming anyone else is tricky, yet it's possible with a bit of conscious intention."
leo,2011-11-18,"You could respond so quickly to someone's invitation that you end up saying yes to more activities than you can handle. It's worthwhile to take time and think about what happens next or you may be unpleasantly surprised by where your overinflated optimism leads you. However, you don't need to act too cautiously if you simply temper your enthusiasm. Making good use of your common sense can minimize the chances of a difficult situation developing later on."
virgo,2011-11-18,"Hiding your anger today isn't the best approach to managing an intense interaction with an emotional person. Unfortunately, your feelings are more transparent than you think, leading others to mistrust you if they see that you aren't being completely honest. Don't wait until your frustration reaches the boiling point before you say something. Avoid unnecessary arguments by sharing your inner process before it grows out of control."
libra,2011-11-18,"Your need to please your friends may lead to more enjoyment today than you expect. But if you're only thinking about what you can get out of a situation, your expectations will surely stand in the way of a potentially joyful experience. You may have to manage your desire to maintain control, even if you appear to be unattached to what happens. Your best chance of finding happiness now is interacting with others without trying to manipulate the outcome."
scorpio,2011-11-18,"You are motivated to take a firm stand on an issue that demonstrates your integrity today. However, your concerns about being judged in a negative light could tempt you to overstate your position. You may be so adamant that others go quiet, thinking there's no room for meaningful dialogue. You can soften your words without having to compromise your convictions by remembering that someone can hold a different point of view without taking anything away from yours."
sagittarius,2011-11-18,"Your confidence has returned, prompting you to shut off anyone else's negative feedback about your big plans. If someone is dissatisfied with your stated intentions now, you may be tempted to walk away and do your own thing without any further discussion. However, it's not wise to be so quick to leave your friends behind. Take a deep breath and slow down today; give others sufficient time to come around to your perspective because everyone will have more fun playing in a group."
capricorn,2011-11-18,"You may believe that someone is exerting unnecessary control over you now and you aren't happy about it. Rather than quietly avoiding a direct confrontation, you're eager to face it head-on. Unfortunately, if you believe that you are right, the dynamics can take a turn for the worse. However, creating a win-win situation flips you into a cooperative mode where everyone comes out ahead."
aquarius,2011-11-18,"You are supportive of others who are extra clear about their needs; however, you're not as enamored with those who act selfishly. You may try to maintain an upbeat attitude today, but someone could inadvertently push you too hard, provoking a forceful response. However, you don't have to slip unconsciously into conflict. Deflect overt aggression by confidently holding your position and cheerfully waiting for things to work out."
pisces,2011-11-18,"You might inadvertently make too big of a deal out of what you are doing today because you crave positive feedback, rather than criticism, from others. But doing your work isn't a guaranteed path to gaining more attention. Don't waste energy wondering if you are appreciated by your peers; just complete your assignments as efficiently as possible, without looking back. Ultimately, your performance brings more positive recognition than shining the spotlight on yourself."
aries,2011-11-19,"Even if you have been planning your life in general terms, you can be more effective today by bringing everything down to a manageable size. Rather than trying to consider the enduring consequences of what you do now, limit your thinking to the immediate impact. There's nothing to be gained by attempting to solve all the problems of the world; just make small improvements to your own life and let the ramifications of your actions ripple outward naturally."
taurus,2011-11-19,"Although you're eager to have a day off, your mind is probably still on your work, especially if you're lucky enough to enjoy your job. Otherwise, you may be ready to jump into a project on the home front that allows you to express yourself in a creative manner. In either case, staying focused increases your chances of being productive enough so you can kick back and relax later in the day."
gemini,2011-11-19,"The discriminating Virgo Moon helps you to notice all the minor details today. Meanwhile, mental Mercury and sensual Venus are traveling through uplifting Sagittarius, opening your mind to exploring the distant horizons. It's tough to follow through with either perspective because your thoughts are bouncing back and forth. Nevertheless, attempting to make a logical decision may be an exercise in frustration now; following a hunch just might be your best chance for success."
cancer,2011-11-19,"The amount of preparation you do now determines how much you actually accomplish today. If you have a solid plan and concentrate on the immediate tasks at hand, you could power through your chores. But if you scatter your energy by dreaming about the distant future, you might end up annoyed with how much you still have to finish. Scale back your big thinking so you can take care of the little things first."
leo,2011-11-19,"It's going to take extra effort to remain focused today, yet limiting your activities should pay off. It may be tempting to express your excitement in a competitive manner or impulsively run with someone else's bold idea. However, it's very important to follow through on whatever you start or you could be harsh with your self-criticism later. Giving up prematurely is not a smart strategy; however, continuously bringing your thoughts back to the present moment will improve your efficiency throughout the day."
virgo,2011-11-19,"It may feel as if things are beginning to settle down a bit now that the Moon is visiting your sign. However, you might be uncharacteristically overconfident as you think about what happens next. Don't trust your logic today, especially if your future seems too good to be true. Your life is on the upswing, but managing the details as they surface, rather than ignoring them, keeps you in touch with reality."
libra,2011-11-19,"You would be wise to finish up an old project this weekend so you are ready for the new opportunities that will show up next week. Unfortunately, it may not be so simple to take care of business now because you could inadvertently be working against your own success. Stop procrastinating; you can't delay the inevitable by ignoring what needs to be done today."
scorpio,2011-11-19,"It's fully acceptable to be as picky as you want about your social commitments because you don't have much time to waste today. Even if you did, you would still rather choose your own activities than follow along with someone else's. But totally isolating yourself from friends and family isn't useful, either. Manage your time more efficiently so that you can enjoy hanging out with those who matter the most to your heart."
sagittarius,2011-11-19,"Broadcasting your optimism allows others to get a sense of the bigger picture as you see it. But you can become so enamored with your vision of the future that you might miss what is happening right now. Although it may be very tempting to throw yourself into the next exciting adventure of your life, it's helpful to be pragmatic today. Toning down your enthusiasm just a notch improves your chances of reaching your goals."
capricorn,2011-11-19,"You may believe that you have a workable plan in place that will enable you to fulfill your dreams, but it might not turn out quite as sweet as you wish. Your thinking is still in an inflationary phase, even if you have already narrowed your focus. However, your best ideas might lose their value if you take them too far. Keeping your expectations in check could be the most important thing you can do today."
aquarius,2011-11-19,"Your friends and acquaintances could steer you in the right direction now as amicable Venus and talkative Mercury are both moving through your 11th House of Group Activities. But the Moon's visit to your less social 8th house tempts you to withdraw and think things out on your own. Nevertheless, hanging out with the right folks can be very rewarding, so don't intentionally isolate yourself. Aim to find a happy medium between losing yourself in a crowd and avoiding others, altogether."
pisces,2011-11-19,"You may be rethinking relationship strategies now as the Moon visits your 7th House of Others. No doubt, it's complicated juggling your domestic responsibilities with other obligations. But, instead of bouncing around from one thing to another, pick one train of thought and follow it all the way through. When you finish, then shift gears and do something else. Staying on a narrowly defined path could bring the stability you seek in partnerships so you can apply your efforts elsewhere next week."
aries,2011-11-20,"You may believe that your imagination can conjure up a wonderful future, but you could be misleading yourself today. It's true that your fantasies might actually guide you along your way, but your intentions must be grounded in reality or they will remain as castles in the air. Although disappointment occurs if you set unrealistic goals, practical seeds should grow into the nourishing fruits of your labor."
taurus,2011-11-20,"Someone might mislead you today, yet it could be your over-eagerness to reach your goals that steers you wrong. Perhaps you misinterpret a message you receive based upon what you want to believe. If the truth comes out, don't waste time being discouraged. Instead, be thankful that you discovered what's happening and make whatever adjustments are necessary to put yourself back on track."
gemini,2011-11-20,"You could feel the stress that arises from trying to balance your playful nature with a more serious side of life today. For example, your attraction to a one-on-one partnership might conflict with your fear of being too vulnerable. Or, perhaps, your parenting skills may be challenged as dynamics at home go through unexpected changes. In any case, it's helpful to acknowledge the truth and take the high road whenever possible."
cancer,2011-11-20,"Family matters are still a central focus now, even if your role at home has already undergone dramatic change. You could be taking yourself very seriously these days, but it feels as if your load is lighter today. Unexplored alternatives are being put in your path, but this still may not liberate you from previous obligations. Instead of worrying about what to do, express what's in your heart -- even if you don't know where it will lead."
leo,2011-11-20,"You may be facing an uncomfortable situation that has you wondering about the validity of your role at home or within your community. Don't lose touch with your feelings, even if you are more analytical than usual when it comes to forming your conclusions now. Although your head and your heart might be in conflict, it's still a wise idea to keep them in balance without favoring either one over the other."
virgo,2011-11-20,"You may think that your life is heading in the right direction now that progressive Mars is in your sign. But you're also aware that your foundations are built on your beliefs and, perhaps, they are not as firm as you would prefer. But don't let fear convince you to hold on to your current assumptions just because what you know is more comforting than what you don't yet understand. Embracing the unknown is scary at first, but it enables you to be open to the potential gains ahead."
libra,2011-11-20,"You might be so moved by someone's story that you have to avoid further conversation to prevent yourself from getting too emotional. Thankfully, your imagination isn't restrained today by the facts alone; you're able to envision a more positive scenario, allowing you to paint an optimistic picture instead of just passively responding to someone's current problems. Be courageous and inspire others with your passionate dreams of change."
scorpio,2011-11-20,"It's challenging to balance your desire for meaningful social interaction with other people's preferences that you don't take everything so seriously. Nevertheless, it isn't just business as usual these days and you're not interested in faking lightheartedness just to satisfy someone else's needs. Don't hesitate to say yes to an intriguing invitation if you think getting together with like-minded individuals might provide a safe container for interesting conversation."
sagittarius,2011-11-20,"It's difficult to know what's real as your fantasies flood your imagination today. Ironically, others may not realize that you're on a mental holiday because they see a more practical side of you that shows up to take care of business. Fortunately, it doesn't require much effort to meet your obligations now, so you can continue to gain inspiration from your inner world while simultaneously making progress in your outer world."
capricorn,2011-11-20,"Your self-doubt could quickly grow out of hand today if you believe that you're not on the right path. However, you should be able to refocus your energy by drawing from your deep reserve of willpower. Be bold and imagine your future just as you want it to unfold. But don't expect your dreams to become real unless you're prepared to work hard and focus your attention on one simple task at a time."
aquarius,2011-11-20,"Since you could spend time drifting in and out of your fantasies today, at least make a concerted effort to discern your hopeful dreams from what's actually happening. It is a magical gift to be able to enhance reality with all your favorite colors, but your cosmetic treatment won't last, leaving you disillusioned at the end of the day. Be grateful that you can escape from the mundane world for a while, but remember to return to earth so you can gain the satisfaction of meeting your obligations as well."
pisces,2011-11-20,"The Sun's square to elusive Neptune blurs the facts in your world today, challenging you to find enough useful data to make a smart decision about your long-term goals. But your future is so colored by your feelings that you cannot see what's truly out there. Nevertheless, daydreaming is a key to unlocking the possibilities of the present moment. Set aside a specific time when you can lose yourself in your fantasies without feeling guilty."
aries,2011-11-21,"You might be very appreciative of a long-time partner or a steadfast friend who continues to stand by you through good times and bad. You're inclined now to tell him or her how you feel, but you may be so insistent about expressing your feelings that your sentiment sounds forced. Don't try so hard; a simple statement of gratitude will be more easily received and is worth more than one that rambles on endlessly."
taurus,2011-11-21,"You can find peace of mind during this busy period without getting too distracted by all your big ideas. However, you still could overdo something that makes you feel good. Thankfully, reacting impulsively isn't your style, especially as your key planet Venus moves toward a sextile with sensible Saturn, reminding you that all actions have consequences. Practicing moderation now is your key to happiness."
gemini,2011-11-21,"You may be feeling self-assured these days, but overconfidence at the wrong time can land you in a pile of trouble. Don't be so eager to please just because you want to demonstrate how nice you are to a friend. Instead of getting yourself into a situation that requires a lot of your time and effort today, limit your involvement before you're in over your head. It's easier to maintain autonomy now than to untangle yourself from an emotional drama later on."
cancer,2011-11-21,"You typically don't like it when people disagree for no apparent reason. Being a peacemaker is one way to smooth over ruffled feathers, but it may sound easier than it actually is today. You could have the very best of intentions, but others might think you're trying to control them. Instead of changing anyone else's behavior, shift your own attitude. Let people know how you feel and then back away to give them time to process their reactions."
leo,2011-11-21,"You may be a bit conflicted today because you cannot make up your mind. You don't want others to perceive you as being wishy-washy, so it's easier to withdraw than to try and explain your uncertainty. If you share your current dilemma, your friends might push you to hurry up and decide. Take your time and don't say anything until you've arrived at your own conclusions."
virgo,2011-11-21,"Although you may try to limit your activities today, you could be lured into participating in someone else's agenda. You might ignore another person's idea at first, but as the plan begins to sound better, you become more tempted to jump on board. Even if you resonate with an innovative concept now, it's still smarter to say no to another obligation. Keep your feet on the ground and focus on your priorities until you have more free time to help out others without compromising your own goals."
libra,2011-11-21,"You may be quieter than usual today, yet others can still appreciate what you have to offer now that the Moon is in your easygoing sign. They seem to understand that your strengths are being energized by a spiritual belief that you can't put into words. Thankfully, you don't have to say much; all you have to do is maintain integrity between your actions and your heart."
scorpio,2011-11-21,"The Moon's visit to your 12th House of Secrets may have you slipping back into your past in order to find the inspiration you need to handle current events. Fortunately, you're a champion at connecting with life's subtle mysteries and you're willing to dig as deep as necessary now to uncover the answers. Keep in mind that your realizations may be so complex that you cannot explain them to anyone else, anyhow. However, there's no pressure to share your discoveries until you're ready."
sagittarius,2011-11-21,"Talking about moderation is one thing, but following through with sensible behavior can often be a challenge for you. Although your key planet Jupiter has recently bestowed his extravagance on you, it's strict Saturn's turn today, reminding you to tighten your belt and show some common sense. Then again, the radiant Sun's shift into your sign tomorrow suggests that your self-restraint may not be long-lived."
capricorn,2011-11-21,"It's not easy to stay on task with waves of optimism giving you new hope. However, the idea of getting something for nothing isn't as appealing now, making you more willing to work for what you want. Fortunately, this mature strategy will likely bring you the rewards you seek as long as you stay focused on your goals and continue steadily on your path without taking any impulsive shortcuts."
aquarius,2011-11-21,"This could be your day of reckoning if you are overextended. Unfortunately, you may have reached too far by spending too much energy on a project or buying an expensive item that you really didn't need. Past actions catch up with you now as you struggle to regain firm footing. Even if you don't immediately see positive results from today's efforts, rest assured that your persistence will eventually have the effect you desire."
pisces,2011-11-21,"You're tempted to act in an overly demanding manner today because you may believe that you deserve more than you have. Unfortunately, the squeaky wheel doesn't always get the grease and you could receive a greater payoff by just being patient, instead. Value-conscious Venus in your 10th House of Status forms a supportive sextile with calculating Saturn, giving you strength of purpose and the ability to wait for sweet satisfaction."
aries,2011-11-22,"You might become agitated by something that seems to be just beyond your perceptions today, yet your unsettled frame of mind actually motivates you to accomplish more than you realize. Fortunately, the Libra Moon in your 7th House of Others indicates that your friends can help you gain clarity. Nevertheless, don't try to control your thoughts just because you would be more comfortable if you had answers. Relax and let your mental wanderings take you on a wild ride."
taurus,2011-11-22,"You are known both for your penchant to take the course of least resistance and your ability to be very stubborn. Either way, you usually choose stability over innovation. However, you're now being offered new ways to respond to familiar situations, encouraging you to break out of a rut. Instead of just repeating your past behavior, you're ready to shatter an old habit. Risk-taking isn't always wise, but today it should work in your favor."
gemini,2011-11-22,"Although you might not think you have time to just kick back and enjoy yourself today, something could occur that gives you more freedom than you expected. Don't question the opportunity that's being handed to you; go ahead and take a chance. Just make sure that you also pay attention to your obligations; don't push your current limits too far or you will regret your actions tomorrow."
cancer,2011-11-22,"Normally, you might ignore an opportunity for emotional thrills if you're afraid that it will destabilize your life. But your eagerness for change is increasing now and you're tempted to ignite the fireworks, even if you could get burned. Thankfully, the risk isn't as great as it seems today, so grant yourself permission to do something fun that's outside of your regular comfort zone."
leo,2011-11-22,"Even if there aren't any easy answers today, you still may have a pretty good idea of what you should do. It's critical to take direct action to establish strong boundaries to help you feel safe. But self-protection is a double-edged sword because you could inadvertently isolate yourself from those you need in the process. Expressing your emotions enables you to keep your heart open."
virgo,2011-11-22,"All aspects of communication are becoming more important as Mercury slows down to turn retrograde on Thursday. You might choose to remain unemotional today, but sticking to dry facts will probably leave you feeling unsatisfied. You need to dig deeper to get past your logical filter so you can fully engage your experiences. Don't worry if you cannot understand everything that happens; you will have time to put your day into perspective later if you let it unfold naturally."
libra,2011-11-22,"You may need to make a very practical decision today that has long-lasting consequences, yet your logic remains elusive to those who think they know you well. It seems as if you're being reckless, but others don't realize that you've been seriously contemplating your choice for some time. Don't worry if you're still unsure of your direction; uncertainty is part of this ongoing process."
scorpio,2011-11-22,"Circumstances appear to be pushing you into a corner today, but the lightning bolt of awareness strikes just when you start to feel hopeless. Your new perspective changes the rules of the game. You're not restrained by old patterns any longer if you can see yourself in a different light. Ironically, the external situation may stay the same for a while, but at least you are now free to explore alternative options before deciding what to do next."
sagittarius,2011-11-22,"You're looking forward to starting new projects and activities now that the brilliant Sun is shining in your sign. After a recent period of retreat or isolation, you're super-motivated to make something social happen today. But your words may be slightly ahead of your actions and it could take a few more days before you notice a real difference in your life. Don't be too self-critical if you want to have some fun; you've earned the right to play."
capricorn,2011-11-22,"You might try to hit the brakes today, but you'll probably just keep going. Even if it's a smart idea to slow down and consider the consequences of your behavior, an extra push on the gas pedal may be exactly what you need to blast you out of your current reverie and shock you into seeing the truth. Once your eyes are open wide, you'll be able to make a fresh assessment of your situation so you can plot a new course of action."
aquarius,2011-11-22,"A combination of intelligence, skill and magic might temporarily solve your current dilemma. Even if you worked yourself into an unpleasant corner, a sudden burst of energy today gives you the impetus to try different solutions to old problems that continue to block your progress. Don't be concerned if you cannot find a permanent fix; taking calculated risks might alleviate the immediate pressure now and give you additional breathing room."
pisces,2011-11-22,"You can feel a rebellious mood coming on and you might slip into the habit of contradicting what others say today. If you are expected to follow along with someone's plans, he or she may be sorely disappointed when you take a more independent route. It's challenging to logically explain why you need to be different now, and your attempts to do so could only deepen the confusion. Just making sure that everyone knows how serious you are helps them to understand your desire for freedom."
aries,2011-11-23,"Reaching your career objectives or finding your life's purpose becomes more important now as your desires intensify. You could even grow obsessive, afraid that you'll miss your chance if you don't push harder toward your goals. Unfortunately, it's possible to ride roughshod over other people if you don't stop and think about the consequences of your actions. Thankfully, you can be quite effective today if you simply take time and consider the feelings of those close to you."
taurus,2011-11-23,"A relationship grows more complex if your friend or partner is as inflexible as you are today. Fortunately, you can change the dynamics of the situation by resolving to meet others halfway, instead of trying to fit them into your agenda. In fact, you might be so pleased with the responses you receive that you give more in return. Rather than trying to get your way now, seek common ground instead."
gemini,2011-11-23,"It's a bit unsettling when your rational thoughts are overpowered by intense emotions. You might even think that you're losing control of the situation. However, this can be a magical moment if you're willing to admit to yourself that you weren't running the show even when you believed you were. Broadening your horizons by exploring uncharted feelings can tune you into a deeper message that's buried behind the noisy distraction of language."
cancer,2011-11-23,"This could be a day that's filled with contemplation, but that won't stop you from joining in with others if you think that you might have a good time. You want to enjoy the camaraderie, but you might have mixed feelings about engaging in lighthearted social chatter today. Nevertheless, you will probably be happier if you consciously set aside your serious thoughts for a while. Focusing too much attention on your emotions now gets old quickly and isn't a smart idea."
leo,2011-11-23,"You may feel the need to work harder so you earn more money, but financial success could lose its importance in the weeks ahead. Luckily, you aren't in a hurry now because you secretly believe that your patience will ultimately be rewarded. Don't show all your cards yet, or you'll give away your power too soon. Playing the waiting game is easier if everyone doesn't know what you're going to do next."
virgo,2011-11-23,"You have felt emotionally protected recently, but tensions still lurk beneath the surface. You may be smooth enough today to avoid an open conflict with someone close to you, but there's still a world of difference that separates you from each other. Thankfully, you're motivated by a desire for mutual respect and the tolerance of different beliefs. Giving the gift of freedom to others enables love to flourish in a healthy environment."
libra,2011-11-23,"Perhaps you recently demonstrated your flexibility by encouraging the ones you love to pursue their own interests. But now the tables are turned and you may need to defend your core beliefs. You're not so eager to go along with someone else's vision if it contradicts your basic values. Overcome your fears and state your boundaries; although this can feel frightening at first, everyone should feel better after you make your limits clear."
scorpio,2011-11-23,"The Moon's visit to your sign usually brings your emotions to the surface. Now, however, courageous Mars aligns with passionate Pluto, encouraging you to act on your feelings, rather than to talk about them. Although your mood changes throughout the day, your resolve remains steady and you won't be easily deterred from your destination. Fortunately, you should be able to make great progress as long as you don't try to cut any corners."
sagittarius,2011-11-23,"The irrepressible Sun-Uranus trine sends shockwaves of change through your life. Others may not fully approve of your need to shake things up because they only see what's working well. Meanwhile, your inner restlessness won't go away until you do something about it. Embracing an uncertain future is a good idea, but don't sacrifice your convictions for the sake of being flexible."
capricorn,2011-11-23,"You may have an opportunity to retreat from your usual responsibilities today, giving you time to reconsider where your life is taking you. Normally, your ambition drives you on an upward path toward your career objectives, but now you're less concerned with professional advancement than with spiritual fulfillment. Thankfully, removing the pressure to succeed could open new doorways to destinations that were not previously on your radar."
aquarius,2011-11-23,"It's a busy day with the Moon's presence in your 10th House of Public Recognition, but you may not be willing to live up to anyone else's expectations now. Even if someone tries to tap into your wisdom and experience, you might avoid getting involved because you prefer journeying within today. You'll be better off if you let others know your true intentions right from the start. Just make sure that you state your case kindly so no one's feelings are hurt."
pisces,2011-11-23,"You may feel rejuvenated as you regain emotional clarity today. However, your intense feelings about a relationship might not be received so well by someone else. Your message is very important, but so is the tone of your words. Even if your perspective is radical, there's no need to purposefully provoke other people's fears. Concentrating on the highest potential should keep you on a successful path."
aries,2011-11-24,"You'd like to believe that what you see is what you get today, but things are not as they appear. Although you might think that you're in control, reality doesn't seem to conform to your perceptions. Instead of pretending that you're in charge, it's wise to acknowledge that the job is more than you can handle. Try a more contemplative approach while waiting for a better time initiate change."
taurus,2011-11-24,"You may be drawn into someone's emotional drama today with the Moon in your 7th House of Relationships, but you cannot rely on your feelings to guide your response to the situation. Ironically, ignoring your intuition isn't a better strategy because a logical approach won't prove any better. Rather than trying to be an authority now, admit you don't have the answers. Just practice being a good listener; your compassion will help more than you think."
gemini,2011-11-24,"Don't try to understand the complexities of a relationship today because mischievous Mercury's retrograde turn in your 7th House of Others can muddle communication. If you believe that you can unravel the mysteries of a misunderstanding now, you'll probably just end up frustrated. However, if you're willing to allow the current situation to unfold naturally, the answers will become apparent in their own time. In the meantime, enjoy your fantasies without trying to make them real."
cancer,2011-11-24,"Following your gut instincts could lead you into a situation where bad judgment further complicates your life. Although you think you know how all the pieces fit together now, the mystery is more complicated than you realize. Unfortunately, your current tendency to believe you can meet all your obligations isn't necessarily based on reality. Instead of dreaming about the possibilities, rely on common sense to keep your feet on the ground."
leo,2011-11-24,"You can see the good times ahead and may be very eager for what's next. If it seems like the hard work is over you might be glossing over some important facts. Paradoxically, your overconfidence could be a deterrent to success because it leaves little room to accept help from others. Find an open-minded approach that still allows the possibility for you to learn more and grow."
virgo,2011-11-24,"Clever Mercury, your ruling planet, can create a pile of mischief today as he turns retrograde in your 4th House of Foundations. You may be concerned that you missed your opportunity, but time is slowing down to give you a chance to rebuild a solid base to your life if you don't take on too much. However, you may need to let go of the truth you think you know. Approaching the future with an attitude of a beginner is better than thinking you know it all."
libra,2011-11-24,"An unusual turn of events could complicate your life today as Mercury turns retrograde in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Unfortunately, everyone seems to think that you can sort everything out. Thankfully, your positive attitude is your greatest strength now; your plan will likely work if you believe in yourself. Just don't push your luck too far; knowing your limitations helps to ensure your success."
scorpio,2011-11-24,"Although you may feel as if you've worked yourself into a corner, you now have a window of opportunity to turn things around. However, it could take more time than you realize, so don't frustrate yourself by trying to do everything all at once. A positive attitude helps, but showing up over-eager could put others off because they know that your show of confidence is false. Even if you're facing real deadlines, remember that acting before it's time won't help you or anyone else."
sagittarius,2011-11-24,"The Sun's anxious quincunx to your ruling planet Jupiter encourages you to take on more than you can effectively handle. No matter how visionary you think you are today, you still don't have all the answers within your scope. Although you might be the one who can usually put the big picture into a coherent plan, it's time to let someone else share the responsibility now. But this isn't about giving up; it's merely about recognizing your limits."
capricorn,2011-11-24,"You believe in karma -- that if you do your job well, success should follow. But inflated expectations can set you up for disappointment, unless you acknowledge the fact that life doesn't come with this any guarantees. Nevertheless, do the best you can, even if positive results seem elusive. Trying to get noticeable results too soon will only add to your frustration. Sticking to your original plan is still your safest path to continued progress."
aquarius,2011-11-24,"Being in the social spotlight can seem like a bit too much now, making you wish that you could be less visible. Even if you try to keep your feelings to yourself, you still might not escape from the public eye. Instead of hiding from others, find ways to enjoy the attention. If you act in an upbeat manner when others are around, you'll end up having more time for contemplation when you're alone."
pisces,2011-11-24,"You're not a stranger to the magical realms of imagination, but your eagerness to jump into a daydream can create problems today because there's so much to do in the real world. Unfortunately, it's difficult to know what makes the most sense because everything looks better than it actually is. Exercising a bit of self-restraint may be your key to success since it will give you extra time to attend to important details that can ultimately make the difference between failure and success."
aries,2011-11-25,"You are impatient to begin a new project today, but complications may arise before you even take your first step. Today's Sagittarius Solar Eclipse in your 9th House of Big Ideas gives you the nod to go ahead, but demands on your time may prohibit you from actually proceeding. Don't read the signals wrong; a blinking yellow light is very different from a red light. Look in all directions and if it's safe, keep on going."
taurus,2011-11-25,"The philosophical Sagittarius Solar Eclipse encourages you to consider issues that don't normally concern you. You're excited about exploring exotic places and investigating new ideas now, and less concerned about being practical. However, you won't have to travel far away to satisfy these desires. Learning about a different culture or studying a foreign language enables you to journey to amazing places within your mind."
gemini,2011-11-25,"Today's Sagittarius Solar Eclipse falls in your 7th House of Partners, indicating your desire to improve a significant relationship by taking it in a new direction. No one is perfect, yet your current willingness to learn how to become a better version of yourself initiates real personal growth as you delve deeper into your own emotions. Rather than scattering your energy now, concentrate your attention on what matters most."
cancer,2011-11-25,"Today's Sagittarius New Moon Eclipse emphasizes your 6th House of Health, reminding you that your wellness begins with simple lifestyle decisions. You can improve your diet by eliminating things that are not nourishing or just cutting back on unnecessarily rich foods. For now, it is smarter to make a small adjustment that lasts for a long time, rather than shaking up everything for a few days, only to settle back into an old, familiar habit."
leo,2011-11-25,"You can take the edge off your anxiety by engaging in competitive sports, either as a spectator or as a participant. You could even temporarily forget about your worries while you're totally absorbed in the game of your choice now that today's Sagittarius Solar Eclipse activates your 5th House of Fun and Games. Although strenuous physical activity will have more immediate positive results, nearly anything that allows you to be spontaneous is healthy."
virgo,2011-11-25,The open-minded Sagittarius New Moon Eclipse illuminates your 4th House of Roots today. You may feel a strong yearning to sink into your past and attempt to recover a memory that has particular relevance now. But your thoughts might be so vague that you end up feeling frustrated rather than comforted. Focusing your intentions on the possibilities of the future is ultimately more constructive than nostalgically dreaming about the past.
libra,2011-11-25,"Meandering philosophical conversations with close friends or siblings takes your mind off more serious problems today with an inspiring Sagittarius Solar Eclipse stimulating your 3rd House of Communication. However, these spirited conversations won't necessarily lead to anything productive. However, verbal banter with a trusted friend can enrich your life now, giving you the impetus to establish goals and try to achieve them. Just remember, you will still have to put in the hard work to reach your destination."
scorpio,2011-11-25,"You may question your own abilities as the optimistic Sagittarius Solar Eclipse flip-flops the energy of your 2nd House of Self-Esteem. You might feel overconfident one moment and reach out too far, throwing you off balance. Establishing sensible goals is a healthy strategy to lift your spirits and motivate you to stretch yourself. But it's smarter to take small successful steps rather than attempting giant ones that invite failure."
sagittarius,2011-11-25,"Today's New Moon Solar Eclipse in your outgoing sign sets an upbeat tone to the day. You're enthused about doing something exciting, but it may be easier to conjure up a great idea than to turn it into something tangible today. Fortunately, you should be able to get what you need if you don't assume that you deserve whatever you want. Practicing humility and exercising self-control can bring your goals within reach."
capricorn,2011-11-25,"Although today's Sagittarius New Moon Eclipse falls in your 12th House of Endings, what happens next is more important than what already occurred. But don't go rushing blindly into a new project yet; it's crucial to have a sensible plan first. You don't have to make life-altering changes; in fact, slowing down your progress gives you time to consider various alternatives before taking your next step."
aquarius,2011-11-25,"You're excited about your plans for the weeks ahead as the highly inspirational Sagittarius Solar Eclipse activates your 11th House of Groups. The idea of having fun with friends and family inspires you to engage in more social activities, but you could become so busy that you end up exhausted by the good times. If you find that you have overcommitted yourself, don't blame your bad decisions on anyone else. Just cut back on your social schedule before it's too late."
pisces,2011-11-25,"You might be unable to let go of your thoughts about getting ahead today, even if you're distracted by social or family events. The aspiring Sagittarius Solar Eclipse shakes up your 10th House of Career, revealing new ways to get what you want, even if you feel blocked in your professional development. But don't mistake a new course of action for a shortcut. Even if the future looks bright, it's still going to require hard work and determination to get there."
aries,2011-11-26,"Risking your current security might seem like a good plan today, but an unsuccessful shortcut will only require you to continue going back over the same territory until you learn your lesson. But your memory is short now, so the past may not be readily accessible. Just remember that you can trick yourself into believing there's a quick fix when there's none to be found. There's no way around it; the road to happiness will take time and hard work."
taurus,2011-11-26,"Your ruling planet Venus squares rebellious Uranus today, turning your down-to-earth tastes into more unconventional attractions. You may try to ignore your edgy desires because you don't want to jeopardize your standing within your family or community; however, denying your true feelings doesn't help matters one bit. Share your most eccentric emotions with a trusted friend now, but don't become attached to the outcome of the conversation."
gemini,2011-11-26,"You're probably more flexible than most of your friends, and today you could take your ability to avoid making a final decision to a whole new level. You may get on other people's nerves because you want to leave so many options open. You might be afraid that making a commitment too soon can prevent you from being available for a bigger opportunity later. However, waiting too long could actually cause you to miss something satisfying that is right in front of you."
cancer,2011-11-26,"You don't want to jeopardize your security for the fleeting possibility of an amazing experience. Nevertheless, you may still be attracted to engaging in unusual behavior, even if it places a strain on your life. Keep in mind that you can accept your current desires even if they are outside your usual comfort zone. Acknowledging an irrational urge doesn't mean that you must act on it."
leo,2011-11-26,"You enjoy feeling fully alive, but may grow tired of getting bounced around by your crazy desires today. One minute you're feeling wonderful about a romance, and the next you're wondering about the wisdom of your heart. The extreme swings of attraction and fear will pass if you don't overreact with emotions on either end of the spectrum."
virgo,2011-11-26,"You might not be able to verbalize what you want today because your desires are taking you into unknown territory. Instead of eagerly exploring your emotions, you're tempted to sidestep what's in your heart since it's easier to maintain a detached perspective when you stay up in your head. However, you could inadvertently bring on the emotional meltdown you're trying to avoid unless you're willing to step beyond the limits of your rational thoughts and into the realm of feelings."
libra,2011-11-26,"Your attempts at being serious might not go as expected today since unpredictable Uranus can turn your life inside out as it squares your ruling planet Venus. You're not as sensible as you think, and your irrational behavior can create a series of events that require you to shift your plans suddenly. Instead of wasting energy trying to avoid the inevitable, be open to the excitement that comes from trying new things and meeting new people."
scorpio,2011-11-26,The emphasis on your 2nd House of Finances today indicates that you don't mind spending extra cash on something that helps you express your feelings toward a special friend. You won't likely purchase anything that is ordinary because your tastes are more eccentric than usual now. Buying a unique gift can be a joyful experience as long as you keep the other person's needs in mind rather than getting something that you would secretly like yourself.
sagittarius,2011-11-26,"You are often drawn to ideas of doing something adventurous with your friends, but today you might pass up a social activity so you can stay home. Of course you can't do both, so choosing one or the other could become problematic if others demand that you make a choice. But micromanaging your day isn't a sensible strategy; you'll be happier now if you let someone else make the decisions. You could end up feeling a real sense of exhilaration once you let go of control."
capricorn,2011-11-26,"You might feel unsettled if you're playing outside of the rules now. Normally, Venus' shift into your sign motivates you to follow a conservative path of the heart, but her square to wild Uranus pushes you into new territory today. Letting go of old familiar systems expands your horizons while increasing the variety of possibilities ahead. It's time for you to take a risk; you won't be disappointed."
aquarius,2011-11-26,"You're feeling on-edge as Venus squares your key planet Uranus. You want to do something crazy that makes you stand out in a crowd, but you could go overboard today. Friends may be shocked by your sudden uncharacteristic behavior and might criticize your actions. Don't worry about how others judge you; just stay true to yourself."
pisces,2011-11-26,"You are more attracted to eccentric people today, especially if you have been showing self-restraint in your own personal expression. The wilder you are the less everyone else needs to act out your suppressed feelings. You have an excellent opportunity to experiment with what you want, within reason, of course, so try something outrageous; you can always return to your old ways tomorrow."
aries,2011-11-27,"Remain upbeat about your contributions when pushing toward your goals whether you're making plans to achieve a goal at work or striving to be noticed within your community. Thankfully, you should receive assistance from an important person now that friendly Venus is visiting your 10th House of Public Status. Go ahead and do your best work, but make certain to ask for the credit that you deserve. Although seeing tangible results may take a few days, you could be surprised at the outcome."
taurus,2011-11-27,"It's always lovely to be appreciated, and today is especially sweet because you receive so much positive energy from Venus' trine to optimistic Jupiter in your sign. Nevertheless, it isn't always appropriate to overwhelm others with your exuberance. A touch of self-restraint can help you reach your goals. Don't sprint to the finish line; it's not as close as you think."
gemini,2011-11-27,"You may be very clear about what you want out of a relationship now, especially if you have been clarifying your needs all year long. The time is ripe to make something happen, and you could blow your chances if you wait too long. Maintain a positive attitude while sharing your feelings, even if you don't know where the conversation is leading. But don't let this opportunity pass without acting on what's in your heart."
cancer,2011-11-27,"You may be emerging from a tough phase, yet you're still able to rationalize what you want. However, many delicious feelings are bubbling up from your subconscious now and tempting you to set aside your objectivity. Hold on steady and keep your eyes on the current opportunities, for this wave should ultimately bring a positive transformation."
leo,2011-11-27,"Beneficial Jupiter is visiting your 10th House of Public Success and its trine to pleasurable Venus in your 6th House of Work could resonate with your plan to accomplish a lot today. Unfortunately, you might feel like a lazy Lion with plenty of excuses to justify your unproductive nature. Remember, you don't have to prove anything to anyone at all. You deserve a bit of downtime now, so take it while you have the chance."
virgo,2011-11-27,"You might not be happy at first with whatever happens today, but you may be willing to wait for satisfaction once you realize the potential pleasures that are available to you. Even if you try to fight against the changes, your resistance fades quickly once you sink beneath your noisy thoughts and into the less familiar non-verbal world of emotions. Ultimately, your feelings will steer you in the right direction now."
libra,2011-11-27,"This is a magical day to immerse yourself into your feelings without wasting any energy rationalizing what's in your heart. Don't be afraid to act on your intuition because the signals that are now coming from your subconscious are integrally connected with your truth. Only negativity stands between you and your success, so jump in and follow your positive instincts before you change your mind."
scorpio,2011-11-27,"It's not such a bad idea to temporarily set aside your personal interests now and concentrate on selfless acts of generosity. However, don't spoil the moment by asking what's in it for you. If you really need to know, then you're missing the point entirely. Ultimately, if you stay focused on the highest expression of love, the emotional rewards will always circle back and touch your heart."
sagittarius,2011-11-27,"You may attempt to hide your anger today because you really don't want it to interfere with the general loveliness that's floating around in your environment. Fortunately, with valuable Venus in your 2nd House of Income, you could feel as if everything you touch turns to gold. Just keep in mind your ability to work in service to others now is enough of a gift to make you happy."
capricorn,2011-11-27,"Sensual Venus harmoniously trines happy-go-lucky Jupiter today, promising fun activities and empowering you to co-create new games. Unfortunately, you may not be able to escape your responsibilities just because the phone is ringing and good times are calling. Thankfully, you can still enjoy yourself by expressing your creative urges in a practical project."
aquarius,2011-11-27,"You may be feeling so intense now that you don't know how to say what you're thinking without upsetting others. Unfortunately, keeping your thoughts to yourself isn't a smart strategy either, since suppressed emotions will blast their way to the surface sooner or later. Expressing love and not fear can transform obstacles into positive learning experiences."
pisces,2011-11-27,"You're eager to please others now with the Moon visiting your 11th House of Social Networking. You can be a wonderful friend, but you must be careful about only acknowledging the good news. The power of positive thinking can help you today, but you could take your optimism too far. Obsessing on the possible negative outcomes isn't useful, but neither is burying significant issues without addressing them."
aries,2011-11-28,"You are motivated to get ahead on the job now, but your ambitions may be so strong that that you don't bother checking in with your close friends to find out how they feel about what you're doing. Although you don't need the approval of others when making your plans, it's still wise to seek feedback from those you trust the most. There's no rush to act immediately so give yourself plenty of time, or you might find yourself far out on a limb without an easy way back."
taurus,2011-11-28,"You are continuing to gain clarity about your goals with the Capricorn Moon's presence in your 9th House of Future Vision. However, you might realize that your current path isn't leading you to the exact place you want to go. It may not be the best time to shift directions, but it surely can't hurt to start planning for the upcoming changes."
gemini,2011-11-28,"You may grow uncomfortable today if a close friend or lover asks you too many questions about your relationship. You might sidestep a direct interrogation about your motives by not answering with a definitive yes or no; however, it's not easy to maintain ambiguity now. You cannot evade making a decision any longer, so share your thoughts and then put your words into action."
cancer,2011-11-28,"You want to strengthen your emotional connection with a special someone in your life today, but you might not be as available if your partner is too demanding. You may be feeling so practical that it's hard to show any vulnerability. Your smartest move might be to retreat now so you can reconnect with your own needs before engaging in an intense conversation. Once you re-establish your center, you'll be able to communicate your feelings in a more constructive manner."
leo,2011-11-28,"You might wish that you weren't so direct today because your actions can be a bit intimidating to someone who is less dynamic than you. It's challenging to see a problem before it arises, and beating around the bush isn't your preferred style. Nevertheless, a bit of self-restraint is in order now. Ultimately, controlling your anger by acting in a diplomatic manner will help you to get what you want."
virgo,2011-11-28,"You're able to tap into a deep well of creativity today, but you must find a sensible method to integrate it into your day or you won't have much to show for your efforts. Instead of trying to capture a sudden burst of genius, try to find a groove that's comfortable enough to sustain. Remember, being productive is more important now than being clever."
libra,2011-11-28,"You're not interested in frivolous activities today and won't likely be inclined to join your friends unless you believe that what they're doing is worthwhile. Even if you're thinking that you would prefer to have fun, you won't be able to enjoy yourself unless you feel grounded. Your serious attitude turns you into a harsh judge if someone pushes you too hard. However, if you state your needs clearly, you'll get along with others and even have a good time in the process."
scorpio,2011-11-28,"It's in your best interest to decide what you're willing to give in return for what you want before you start any sort of negotiation today. But keep in mind that you won't get very far if you're expecting something for nothing. You'll end up sabotaging your efforts if you're too greedy, so it's better to work toward a mutually beneficial outcome where everyone is a winner."
sagittarius,2011-11-28,"Don't let anyone push you around now; take a stand and be firm about it. Unfortunately, it may not be a simple task to set your boundaries, especially since you could be facing a formidable opponent. Don't be afraid to disagree, even if your words stir up conflict. The chances for resolution are slim today, so don't try to force a victory. Instead, just make sure that your message is heard and then move on."
capricorn,2011-11-28,"Everyone may get more than they bargained for today. If anyone tries to control you, your intense emotions could quickly rise to the surface now that the Moon is in your practical sign. The slightest provocation might elicit a flood of passion that stems from your defense against someone who makes you feel insecure. Thankfully, your current position isn't as precarious as it seems, so don't overstate your case. Take a few deep breaths and let your anxieties dissipate before you respond."
aquarius,2011-11-28,"You're not ready to reveal your secrets today, and the more someone tries to get you to talk, the more you withdraw. Fortunately, you're quite capable of holding your ground, even if a very persuasive person is trying to coerce you to spill the beans. You can't be forced to share anything that you've decided to keep to yourself, so politely decline to answer and change the topic of conversation."
pisces,2011-11-28,"Social situations are more complicated than you think now, because each person has a distinct set of desires. You might be overly confident about your ability to navigate through the emotional landscape, but you cannot please everyone. Nevertheless, you won't be deterred from trying as the Moon visits your 11th House of Friends and Associates. Don't hide your motives; it's better to be honest, even if it triggers a disagreement in the process."
aries,2011-11-29,"You can see exciting possibilities when only yesterday everything seemed more problematic. However, you haven't been suddenly struck with answers to all of your questions. Rather, it's your perspective that's changed and you're more willing now to let the ambiguity resolve naturally. It's healthy to imagine the desired outcome to a situation, but you don't need to force resolution to the issue prematurely."
taurus,2011-11-29,"Although you want to make plans for what's ahead, you might not be eager now to peer too far into your future. You may believe that you're close to achieving an important milestone on your way to success, even if you still have a way to go. Still, there's no use wasting energy by concentrating on a current obstacle. Instead, get busy and revise your schedule with a new timetable that charts your path to your destination."
gemini,2011-11-29,"You might get an uncharacteristic urge to withdraw socially today, but your friends will likely seek you out to join them, anyway. Don't bother giving them your reasons for passing up an invitation; instead, just say yes. You'll be glad that you changed your mind and decided to come out of hiding. It's better to enjoy yourself with others if given the chance because you can always find time to be alone later."
cancer,2011-11-29,"You may be uncomfortable with what's happening in a relationship, yet you now have an opportunity to push beyond your fears. Although you tend to hold on to what's familiar because it fosters security, it's time to take an emotional risk. Don't play it safe; do what you can to align your actions with your needs. You may be pleasantly surprised if you take the initiative today to stretch past your old limitations and try something new."
leo,2011-11-29,"An eccentric person could arrive on the scene now with the non-conformist Aquarius Moon's visit to your 7th House of Others. An exciting invitation may not be what you expected, but you could be tempted to turn down the offer because of time constraints. Luckily, today isn't likely to unfold according to your plans, so it's a good idea to set aside your agenda and have some fun. Your flexibility might just be rewarded with lasting happy memories."
virgo,2011-11-29,"You have a number of unusual tasks on your list of things to do today and may be looking forward to getting started. However, you aren't sure how everything will go until you actually begin, so don't waste time trying to fill in the details. Your best strategy is to let go of your need to micromanage and just make it up along the way. You already have the skills necessary for success, so just apply them as needed."
libra,2011-11-29,"You are easily coaxed into setting aside your long-term responsibilities for a while if you think that you'll be able to experience a bit of pleasure today. The Moon is visiting your 5th House of Play now, so take time to express yourself in the present moment. Don't worry if you need to return later to complete unfinished business. Let yourself be as creative as possible, even if it's not about making money. Don't hold back; do something for the sheer fun of it."
scorpio,2011-11-29,"It requires a lot of effort to talk you into going anywhere today because the Moon in your 4th House of Security reminds you how much you would prefer to stay at home. You want to watch the world go by quietly because your inner experience is much more important now than scattering your energy socially. Don't worry if you don't live up to someone else's expectations; you get to decide what brings true spiritual value into your life, even if it doesn't involve anyone else."
sagittarius,2011-11-29,"The Moon's harmonious connection with the Sun in your optimistic sign today lifts your spirit above the mundane events of your daily life. Your current need for independence is so strong that you might not be willing to justify your desires to anyone else. Of course, you can discuss anything you want, but no one has the authority to tell you what to think. Just taking a moment to remind yourself that you're in charge of your inner world is enough to make you happy now."
capricorn,2011-11-29,"You may want to make a decision about how to budget your money today, but you're being pulled in several directions. It's possible that you have a few things you would like to do, but not enough cash to go around. For example, you could decide to buy something special for yourself, only to see a beautiful gift for someone else. Even if social obligations make your choices more difficult, remember to be nice to yourself. If your heart's  not happy, you won't have anything to give to those you love."
aquarius,2011-11-29,"The Moon's return to your eclectic sign gives you permission to express your feelings, even if they're not what others expect. But it's not necessary to hide your true needs just because others may be uncomfortable with them. However, you don't have the right to spew your opinions without doing so in a kind manner. Being considerate of those you love may change your words, but it really doesn't have to alter your truth."
pisces,2011-11-29,"This is a magical day if you remember that you can create a positive atmosphere wherever you go by virtue of your attitude. Your spiritual orientation is capable of turning the most boring chore into a sacred act of gratitude. But what others perceive now isn't what's important. Honor the richness of your imagination and aspire to experience beauty, even if it cannot be put into words."
aries,2011-11-30,"You may be ready to celebrate if your future is looking brighter these days, but make sure that your imagination isn't playing tricks on you now. Anyway, it isn't necessarily a good strategy to focus your attention on what's around the next corner when there is plenty to be done in the present moment. Today's most intelligent course of action is to take care of your current obligations, without getting distracted by anything else."
taurus,2011-11-30,"You are ready to try something new because it's apparent that sticking to your old plan won't help you reach your goals. However, you're still tempted to play it safe as your fear of failure encourages practicality. Nevertheless, you'll do better today if you can overcome self-doubt and take a calculated risk. You could miss an important opportunity if you don't seize the moment and give it your best shot."
gemini,2011-11-30,"You are quite clever at dancing around a decision in order to get out of making a commitment. Nevertheless, concentrating your attention on a singular goal could be your best possible move today. Normally, you excel at keeping several options open so you can wait until the very last moment before picking one. However, the sooner you choose now, the better your chance of success in your endeavors."
cancer,2011-11-30,"The idea of being intimate with a special person may sound more attractive than actually doing it, because you might feel uncomfortable if you get too close to others today. It isn't that you want to be isolated; you just need a bit more breathing room now. Maybe you're not happy with your current situation and temporarily withdrawing is easier than confronting the truth. However, you can learn something significant about yourself by leaning into your fears instead of avoiding them."
leo,2011-11-30,"Although you think that you're moving through calm waters today, there's still a large storm brewing on the horizon. Thankfully, you can prepare yourself so you won't be caught off guard as the winds whip up and the seas grow rougher. Actually, you're almost eager for an opportunity to show off your high level of competency. Ultimately, if you don't become complacent, this growth experience can raise your profile and your self-confidence."
virgo,2011-11-30,"Normally you're very focused and your ability to concentrate on the details helps you work efficiently. However, it could be more challenging today to bring your grandiose visions down to earth. You're tired of having to be the one who is always practical and you want your imagination to lift you out of your current rut. Luckily, you can make magic now if you give yourself permission to be creative without worrying about the outcome."
libra,2011-11-30,"You're eager to discover new ways to enjoy yourself now with the non-conformist Aquarius Moon hanging out in your 5th House of Love and Creativity. Her indulgent semisquare to sensuous Venus makes it even harder to follow social etiquette. Nevertheless, you know that rude actions are unacceptable. There's nothing wrong with seeking pleasure, but don't overstate your needs or overstep the limits of good behavior."
scorpio,2011-11-30,"You may be highly opinionated today so you need to be careful how you express yourself. It's easy to put so much intensity into your words that others mistake your passion for anger. Fortunately, concentrating on the bigger picture frees you from any perceived negativity. Allowing for a variety of personal preferences now connects you with a more universal vision that inspires those around you."
sagittarius,2011-11-30,"You appear so clever today that you can amaze your friends and co-workers with your inspirational thoughts. But turning your visions into something tangible is quite challenging, especially if you're off to the next great idea the moment after you share the previous one. Proving your intelligence could backfire now if you don't take sufficient time to apply your common sense to your actions."
capricorn,2011-11-30,"You may have an easygoing attitude about your obligations today, but you're not likely as disengaged as you appear. It's just that you are trying to balance your ambitions with more spiritual goals. You want some time to yourself for contemplation, which encourages you to be more sympathetic to other people's needs, too. Ironically, this cooperative spirit enables you to accomplish even more in the long run, for it increases the good feelings between you and your associates."
aquarius,2011-11-30,"You are motivated to be productive, yet you also want to take time and enjoy the camaraderie between you and your workmates today. However, this is tricky territory, for the Moon in your sign adds subjectivity and makes it harder to maintain a healthy perspective. It's tough to know where to draw the line between work and play. Ask someone you trust for advice, but make sure you heed the feedback you receive."
pisces,2011-11-30,"Your dreams usually guide you better than the facts, but you need to be very careful before following your intuition today. Take time to corroborate your hunches with someone else because you can be certain that you know what's happening, only to discover that you missed an important piece of information. Your imagination is still a significant source of inspiration; just remember to do a reality check before jumping to any conclusions."
aries,2011-12-01,"This can be a difficult day if you try to change someone's feelings through coercion or empty gestures. Idle threats won't make a positive impact on anyone; a smarter strategy is to let go of control and surrender to your emotions now. Though propitiation isn't normally your style, calculated actions alone will only box you in. It's time to be bold and take a chance by expressing what's in your heart."
taurus,2011-12-01,"Your emotions are running deep today, but fortunately you should be able to keep your sense of balance. Your friends and associates may not even realize that your feelings are in turmoil because you can appear calm, cool and collected. However, you cannot suppress your desires forever. Let your passions rise to the surface without fearing the outcome; you'll gain more self-assurance if you don't try to hide your heart from view."
gemini,2011-12-01,"You're more emotional today than others think because you can bury your feelings so deep that everything seems normal. But your closest friends can tell that something is stirring beneath the surface. Seek out someone who is trustworthy and share what you're really going through now. It may be challenging to bring up an uncomfortable subject, but once you initiate the discussion you may not be able to stop. Don't be afraid to establish reasonable limits before you take the conversation too far."
cancer,2011-12-01,"You are gaining inner strength today as you explore your emotions, but it's difficult to do this work on your own. Thankfully, the presence of an emotionally available friend or partner can bring a much-needed objective perspective now. Unfortunately, the feedback you receive might not substantiate your original perspective. Your challenge is to acknowledge your changing feelings so you're able to integrate a new way of looking at the current circumstances."
leo,2011-12-01,"You have a number of loose ends to tie up now, yet you could work yourself into an anxious state by trying to beat an arbitrary deadline. Your struggles might indicate there's a more complex set of issues that will take longer to process. Although you could become obsessed by your unrelenting drive, it's perfectly acceptable to leave some chores unfinished today. You don't have to impress anyone with your competence now; just do what you can and call it a day."
virgo,2011-12-01,"You think that your decisions are rational and you're willing to debate anyone who has the audacity to question your choices. Unfortunately, your protests are transparent; it's obvious that your emotions are in charge, even if they make perfect sense to you. Don't waste energy justifying your logic; just admit what you want and move on. You have a much better shot at satisfaction if you don't try to convince others that your way is the only way."
libra,2011-12-01,"Your ruling planet Venus joins dark Pluto today to stir up an intense mixture of innocent love and ruthless passion. You may even be frightened by the power of your feelings now, for they are more complex than you're used to managing. Don't close down in fear; a soulful interaction can take you to a magical and mysterious place if you remain open to the beauty that's all around you."
scorpio,2011-12-01,"Passionate Pluto is your ruling planet, and his visit with sensual Venus today amplifies your feelings of love or lust. Containing your emotions is no small feat now; you would rather express your desires with incisive clarity and unrelenting determination. It's especially sweet if you connect with a willing playmate or partner, but unrealistic expectations can blind you to something special that's right in front of your nose."
sagittarius,2011-12-01,"You might have big plans for your great escape, but the closer you get to the time to leave, you realize that there are more important things to do. If you have a chance to make money now, take the opportunity. But don't just dream of the future; make a commitment and get to work. It's time to let go of your fantasies so you can take tangible steps, however little they may be, toward your long-term goals."
capricorn,2011-12-01,"You are capable of navigating through very intense emotional territory today because you intuitively know that going deeper helps to create a stronger foundation upon which you can build a relationship. However, you don't want to react irrationally because you might be afraid that you will lose control of the situation if you do. The journey to love may be a long one, but facing your own resistance to intimacy is a step that you can take right now."
aquarius,2011-12-01,"Although you don't have all the answers today, you still may be motivated by your desire to show someone how much you know. However, the sooner you admit that whatever is happening is beyond your comprehension, the more you will gain from your current experience. It's time to get out of your head and into your heart because that is where the real action is now."
pisces,2011-12-01,"You can tell who your real friends are because they will show up with intense emotional support when you need them most. Your emotions are not easy to handle today with the Moon back in your sign; you demand so much from others now that you may be pleasantly surprised when someone comes through with the goods. Nevertheless, it pays to be flexible; if you're too rigid, you won't be able to receive what's actually being offered."
aries,2011-12-02,"Your key planet Mars forms a dynamic square to the Sun today, pushing you to defend your position, whatever the cost. Meanwhile, the dreamy Pisces Moon coaxes you to seek softer styles of expression. You may try to balance these opposite approaches, but, ultimately, irrepressible Mars will probably win out. Nevertheless, it's wise to temper your sense of urgency with a kinder and gentler way of dealing with your fears."
taurus,2011-12-02,"Although you might not choose to follow all of the rules today, you don't have to rebel openly just to make your point. Showing your disrespect only attracts problems that you don't need. Instead, lean on the magical quintile between your key planet Venus and restrained Saturn; a more peaceful solution is worth working for. However, if you're not willing to think outside of the box now, you might reject a brilliant idea before you put it into practice."
gemini,2011-12-02,"It's difficult to think straight today, making it wise to postpone a significant decision if you can. If you're not able to delay making your choice, at least don't try to fool yourself into believing that you are being objective. You may have already formed your opinion and new information won't likely change your mind. However, keep in mind that impulsive reactions can be magnets for trouble. Whatever you decide, take your time before giving your final answer."
cancer,2011-12-02,"It's not your normal behavior to display your annoyance outwardly, but you may so unhappy about something at work today that you're eager to discuss the matter with anyone who will listen. Be careful, for your strong opinions might provoke others to react aggressively, beginning a cycle of conflict escalation. Defending your convictions is healthy, but it's really not necessary to turn a minor disagreement into a major battle."
leo,2011-12-02,"It's easy for your anger to boil over today if you don't stay one step ahead of your emotions. You may think that expressing dissatisfaction is the most sensible thing to do now, but, unfortunately, you could take your position too far. Don't worry so much about self-disclosure. It's more important for others to see that you can get the job done than it is for them to know what you're feeling."
virgo,2011-12-02,"You may think that you are highly self-reliant now, but you're still not free to just go off on your own. Other people are depending on you and you must meet your obligations, even if you think you would be happier being on the move. Don't let your frustration turn into anger or it might get the best of you. The choice is yours; you can blame others for the current circumstances or you can assume responsibility for your actions. Take control and start making small improvements to create positive change in your life."
libra,2011-12-02,"A serious tone has settled over your life, reminding you that patience will bring better results than impulsively reacting to someone you find irritating. Your key planet Venus forms a spiritual quintile to somber Saturn in your sign, requiring you to exhibit self-restraint when expressing your feelings. Paying extra attention to your changing moods helps you maintain a healthy perspective. Losing your temper might feel good in the moment, but won't help you to get any closer to your goals."
scorpio,2011-12-02,"You could become so annoyed with a friend or colleague today that you don't even know how to express what's on your mind. You believe that your feelings are justified, but your intensity level may be too much for some people now that the Sun squares your ruling planet Mars. However, it isn't healthy to bury your feelings, so find an appropriate way to let your energy flow. Engaging in physical activity can help you move through this stress with grace. Another option is to confide in a close friend who understands your passionate nature."
sagittarius,2011-12-02,"You'll probably grow frustrated today if you push too hard at work as bossy Mars squares the Sun in your sign. Instead of acting aggressively and trying to get others to do things your way, it's smarter to just work on your own now. Don't bother drawing up complex plans and procedures; just jump in and figure it out along the way. It's great if your friends join in to help, but don't count on their assistance or you could end up waiting all day. Simply show what you can do by setting an example that everyone will want to follow."
capricorn,2011-12-02,"You may find yourself in a predicament today if your current strategy lacks substance. You might have added lots of details to your plan in order to make it seem more concrete, but now you need to take an entirely new approach. Instead of withholding your frustration about a failed approach, channel your energy into refining your tactics before you try again."
aquarius,2011-12-02,"You could be in an awkward position now if others expect more out of you than you can give. You might have assumed that you would have more discretionary time available, but with circumstances flying out of control, you don't seem to be able to handle the chaos. Losing your temper won't make any of your current problems go away. Instead of lashing out, practice being patient because the hectic pace will settle down soon."
pisces,2011-12-02,"Layers of complexity might plague your personal relationships today, making it difficult to know which way to turn. It's easier to forget about figuring it all out so you can focus on fulfilling your responsibilities. Although it seems as if you're doing more than your share or work, it's best to grin and bear it, rather than messing with the status quo. Remember, your emotions are amplified with the Moon in your sign, so wait a couple of days before you make your next move."
aries,2011-12-03,"There are plenty of chores for you to do now, yet you have sufficient energy to handle everything if you tackle each task one at a time. However, it may seem overwhelming if you try to do too much all at once. Don't be fooled by moments of blind optimism or you'll lose ground instead of making progress. Give yourself credit for all that you manage to accomplish. Whatever is left undone today will still be there for you tomorrow."
taurus,2011-12-03,"It's easy to make plans now, yet it's challenging to get the desired results from your current actions. One moment you may feel very expressive, while just a few minutes later waves of self-restraint wash over you. However, the extremes are part of a larger process of ebb and flow. Even if an authoritative person seems to hold you back, be appreciative of the resistance, since slowing down ultimately helps you to be more efficient in the long run."
gemini,2011-12-03,"You may not know what to expect on the home front today as unresolved tension rises to the surface. If you're stymied and can't figure out how to handle the situation, ask a trusted friend for advice; you may be lucky enough to hear exactly what you need. Even if you want to do things your way, consider modifying your position based upon what you learn now. Your flexibility is one of your greatest strengths."
cancer,2011-12-03,"It's unsettling if you're not in charge of your own schedule today, but it feels as if your agenda has been determined by someone else -- and there isn't much you can do to change it. Thankfully, you still may find a way to create magic as the intuitive Pisces Moon opens your mind to a different perspective. It might even make sense to take a risk and try something new just to shake up other people's assumptions about you."
leo,2011-12-03,"You don't like the idea of cutting back on your activities because you lack the cash, but you can't escape from your temporary financial situation. Fortunately, you could come up with an ingenious idea today that enables you to enjoy yourself beyond your expectations -- even if you're occupied with more mundane matters. Keep in mind that avoiding money issues is not a substitute for resolving them; they must still be addressed when your current distractions are over."
virgo,2011-12-03,"You could have a tough time trusting others today, so don't let anyone talk you into doing something that you will regret later. It's wise to honor your initial hunch rather than changing your mind so you can meet someone else's expectations. You might add to the current tension at home with your inflexible position, but this is just a temporary situation. Relationship dynamics will shift soon enough, releasing you from an old emotional pattern."
libra,2011-12-03,"Even if you want to be creative today, your artistic flow may be blocked by your fears of being judged or rejected by others. Your imaginative powers are strong and you can see nearly whatever you believe. Appreciation, and even praise, can come your way now, but it might slip under your radar to arrive unnoticed. Learning to accept yourself exactly as you are can make a real difference in your ability to express yourself freely."
scorpio,2011-12-03,"Your inner child wants to come out and play while the Moon is visiting your 5th House of Self-Expression. You may be thinking more creatively now, yet still feel constrained as you try to let go of your serious concerns. Although you want to have fun, your relationships might fall short of your high expectations. Remember that being spontaneous can happily co-exist with your desire to remain true to your core beliefs."
sagittarius,2011-12-03,"You may take a trip down Memory Lane as the Moon drops into your 4th House of Roots now. However, you won't be satisfied by just indulging your nostalgia, unless you use your connection with the past as a way to better understand the present moment. But even if you want to look ahead rather than behind you, rest assured that sinking into your personal history is a good idea. You have something important to learn from a quick visit back to the days of your childhood."
capricorn,2011-12-03,"You can communicate today without having to say much of anything at all. Your actions really do speak louder than your words, but it's someone else's lack of action that says more than you want to hear. You may need to handle your own feelings of abandonment, yet you could also benefit from the emotional space that is being offered to you now. Don't turn a current event into a major drama or you might cause more trouble than it's worth."
aquarius,2011-12-03,"You may be optimistic that your current financial position will improve soon. Thankfully, your increased efforts at work won't likely go unnoticed now. However, you might become frustrated because it could still take time yet to be acknowledged. Don't worry about the immediate response from your friends or family. Focus on quietly meeting your obligations and have faith that things will turn around before you know it."
pisces,2011-12-03,"Your immediate reaction to someone who attempts to block your progress might just make matters worse now. It's easy to think about what you want to say or do in advance; however, it requires your clear intention to dance with external resistances instead of trying to overpower the hidden energy. Controlling your emotions today is surely more productive in the long run than losing your temper."
aries,2011-12-04,"You're raring to go with the Moon back in your energetic sign and you are eager to tell others about your upcoming adventures. However, instead of receiving the support you expect, your words may fall on deaf ears. Unexpected negative judgment could send you back to the planning room so you can rethink your big ideas. This is not about defeat; it's merely an opportunity to improve your chances for success now by getting your facts in order in advance."
taurus,2011-12-04,"Taking care of your chores that you should have done yesterday should be easier once you actually get started. However, you may feel as if there are forces working against you that prevent you from initiating action. It's tricky to find the source of these elusive pockets of resistance; it's even tougher to change your attitude once you realize that completing even a simple task will be harder today than usual. Don't back down; ultimately your dogged determination will see you through."
gemini,2011-12-04,"People appear to enter your life today for the purpose of encouraging you to take the next step on your journey. But the support may come with a mixed message because following someone else's advice isn't very straightforward now. You're tempted to rush ahead, but complicated logistics or unwieldy red tape is likely to slow your progress. Slow down and attend to details that you thought were already handled to create positive results."
cancer,2011-12-04,"It's nearly impossible to hold on to your plans for today, even if you believe that your abundant physical energy and stamina is enough to power you through any obstacles you might face. Unfortunately, brute strength won't be sufficient; you must work smarter, not harder. Begin by recognizing the limits of your knowledge; faking it will only get you into trouble now. But expressing your vulnerability helps to deepen the bonds between you and those you trust."
leo,2011-12-04,"Be careful if someone tries to convince you that he or she is right and that you are wrong. Other people's arguments may be so persuasive now that you might be tempted to drop your agenda for theirs. Unfortunately, your lack of attention to details can have you moving so fast that you overlook an important fact. Give yourself time to think through any change in plans before you find yourself backed into a corner. A bit of common sense prevents an unnecessary headache later on."
virgo,2011-12-04,"You are close to jumping into a project or taking part in a social activity today, but you might be afraid of someone's judgment. You would rather do things your way now, but may not have as much say in the matter as you wish. Your decision might not allow for any ambiguity, requiring a yes-or-no answer. So think carefully about your desired outcome before deciding whether or not you're willing to sacrifice your freedom."
libra,2011-12-04,"You might not get too much time to yourself today with the excitable Aries Moon moving through your 7th House of Partners, attracting energetic people into your day. Everything and everyone that comes your way is just another bundle of possibilities, which makes it challenging to turn down any social invitations. Instead of trying to limit your options now, just follow the course of least resistance. You might be pleasantly surprised with what happens once you stop scheming for something just out of reach."
scorpio,2011-12-04,"You may be jazzed about turning a corner and entering into a new dynamic with your work and family, yet you could end up spending too much time trying to keep things stable now. If you are juggling a number of mundane issues and projects today, you might not be able to make the larger shift until you make more free time. In the meantime, balance your anticipation for something different with the constancy of familiar routines."
sagittarius,2011-12-04,"You might think that you have all the answers today as you supply family and friends with a stream of philosophical and political repartee. In spite of all your bravado, you really just want to connect with those closest to you. Unfortunately, you could get yourself in over your head in an argument about a topic that's not even interesting to you. You're not fooling anyone; admit what you don't know and engage others on the basis of honest interactions about subjects that really matter."
capricorn,2011-12-04,"You may discover a few new things to do at home today, enabling you to retreat without getting bored. It's fun when there are so many possibilities, but it can be tricky to narrow your choices and just pick one course of action. Don't take your discomfort or frustration out on anyone else. You should feel better after you choose a path and begin pursuing your heart's content."
aquarius,2011-12-04,"You may feel positive about yourself and your current opportunities now, but your friends may not see things as you do. Although everyone has a different idea of how your life should unfold, it's pointless arguing with anyone else about things that are ultimately your own personal business. Instead of escalating a war of words, it may be smarter to withdraw for a while. Setting clear boundaries will give everyone involved a chance to cool off before you revisit the topic at a later time."
pisces,2011-12-04,"You may have already started to put a big idea into motion, and today's active Aries Moon gives you another boost to push you along your way. Although you have a lot of extra energy, it could be challenging to sustain it over an extended period of time. Even if you're ready to take on the world in a moment, don't burn up your resources all at once. Slow down so you can finish what you're working on before you're exhausted."
aries,2011-12-05,"You can be very straightforward about what you want in life and others appear to listen carefully today and take your thoughts seriously. Thankfully, sweet Venus trines your key planet Mars, enabling you to turn on the charm, especially if you must confront a difficult issue. But Mars also runs into harsh Saturn, so you won't get to take the easy way out. Reaching your goals might require more effort than you expect, but gentle persistence should prove to be an effective strategy at this time."
taurus,2011-12-05,"You have an excellent chance of succeeding today as assertive Mars gracefully leans against your key planet Venus, enabling you to express your preferences in a convincing manner. Although your friends want to be a part of your success, there's a limit to what they will do for you now. Don't ask for more than you need just because you think you can get it. Greed won't be rewarded and you could quickly lose the advantage you already gained."
gemini,2011-12-05,"Intimate interactions with others are blessed today by a smooth energy flow that allows you to seem in control, even if you are not. Fortunately, this works well for you as long as you don't abuse the privilege of power. Your vision for the future should not exclude the needs of others; you will reach personal satisfaction only if your goals are in alignment with the greater good. If you can maintain a wider perspective now, everyone will benefit from your magnanimity."
cancer,2011-12-05,"The reactive Aries Moon can make you less concerned with the consequences of your actions. Nevertheless, you're still interested in accomplishing something meaningful at work, instead of just daydreaming in the present moment. However, it's not as if you have to choose one or the other. You can set your sights on a future goal while being attentive in the here and now."
leo,2011-12-05,"Love may be on your mind today, making it tough to concentrate on your work. However, even if you aren't romantically involved now, you still might be a bit more flirtatious than usual. There isn't anything wrong with having a little fun, but don't be so blatant that others criticize you for your irresponsible behavior. Finish your job-related tasks before heading out to play."
virgo,2011-12-05,"You may have big family plans today, but they might need to be rescheduled because of a conflict with work. Conserving your energy is a smart strategy; however, being responsible need not prevent you from having a good time now. Even if you're required to meet a previous obligation first, you know that there is a grand adventure awaiting you just around the next corner. Keep grinning in anticipation, but stay focused until your chores are done."
libra,2011-12-05,"Your ruling planet Venus is all dressed up today, making you the life of any social activity. You like the idea of being around your friends since the positive atmosphere makes it easier to move beyond the worries that might otherwise prevent you from having fun. Even if heavy responsibilities delay your playtime, be ready to make the shift abruptly as soon as you can."
scorpio,2011-12-05,"Even if you would rather do your work away from other people's inquiring minds, you still might find yourself on center stage. There's no reason to waste anyone's energy by trying to hide; it's time to bask in the warmth of recognition now. Just allow yourself to feel good and open up to receiving support from those who appreciate you."
sagittarius,2011-12-05,"People around you can pick up on your upbeat attitude, making your positive energy quite contagious. Even if you're not sure that it's time to spill the beans, you probably won't be able to keep the buzz to yourself today -- not that you should try. Making new connections now extends your reach and allows you to impact even more people than you previously thought possible."
capricorn,2011-12-05,"You're ready -- maybe even eager -- to let go of the reins of control in order to have some fun. Naturally, you wouldn't purposely walk out on a recent commitment, but you may have already assumed more authority than you've earned. Don't base your success on intense drives to convince anyone that your way is the only way. Observe what happens if you allow others to have an equal say in the debate."
aquarius,2011-12-05,"You may feel especially close to someone you love today as beautiful Venus in your 12th House of Inner Peace is supported by competent Mars in your 8th House of Intimacy. Nevertheless, you're still tempted to go off by yourself now in an attempt to protect your heart. Even if being vulnerable raises old fears, you will be happier if you stay involved. Don't worry if differences of opinion come to the surface; negotiating a compromise can bring the two of you even closer together."
pisces,2011-12-05,"You're able to show everyone how much fun you're having today, even while you are hard at work. Thankfully, everything you do seems to have a magic spell woven about it, making you shine all the brighter. But even if your future looks promising, don't ignore the complex issues that are lurking in the shadows. Feeling great about your work enables you to take on even more than usual. Just remember that setting healthy limits will ultimately give you more of a chance to find true freedom."
aries,2011-12-06,"You might be convinced that you're right and you're willing to do whatever it takes today to prove your point. Unfortunately, passion isn't a viable substitute for logic. Acting stubbornly or yelling louder is not an indication that your position is any more correct than someone else's. Instead of demonstrating your insecurity, show your real strength by listening to what others say with an open mind so you can expand your perspective."
taurus,2011-12-06,"The Moon's return to your sign may encourage you to act with unflappable determination; however, you could be tempted to take your confidence a step too far. People might lose respect for you if you're absolutely certain that everyone else is wrong. Extreme judgments are not useful now, so demonstrate your flexibility by giving others the same respect you expect from them. Seeing a complicated issue from multiple perspectives might require a leap of faith but could enrich your life immeasurably."
gemini,2011-12-06,"You may believe that you're being fair-minded, but it might be more difficult than you realize to maintain objectivity today. Ultimately, the truth is harder to find when your feelings are tied up with what you think you know, making you less logical in your analysis. Just remember that your assumptions can differ from someone else's, so take time to clarify them before you find yourself involved in an unnecessary conflict."
cancer,2011-12-06,"Although your confidence is steadily growing, you might not feel ready to share your plans with anyone else yet. If someone tries to make you talk now, you'll probably just clam up even tighter. In fact, you might have an emotional meltdown if you're pushed too far. Take whatever defensive precautions are necessary to protect yourself from a bully. Remember, you're the only one who gets to decide when it's time to tell your story."
leo,2011-12-06,"Your mood is on the upswing today, but it's still wise to exercise caution when sharing your feelings. You are very aware of your own contradictions now, and you're probably quite willing to accept them. However, your co-workers may not be as forgiving, and your emotional disclosure could stir up their insecurities. When everything is taken into consideration, it might be easier to keep your thoughts private for a while longer."
virgo,2011-12-06,"It's a real challenge to do the right thing now because your high ideals complicate your options. Since efficiency is a top priority, you may be hypercritical of someone that seems to be wasting your time or money. However, it's better to consider personal boundaries before reacting, for nothing is gained by telling others what to do. Nobody's perfect, so focus on managing your own business and not everyone else's."
libra,2011-12-06,"Your diplomatic efforts can be very useful today, especially if others seem to be gravitating toward a conflict. Your friends might be totally unaware of how close they are to a potentially harmful argument because their emotions, instead of their brains, are blindly leading them forward. Don't be afraid to intervene if you think you can help. You have an important role to play as a peaceful warrior."
scorpio,2011-12-06,"You may have to stand up to an adversary today, but your commitment to peaceful coexistence can turn a tricky situation into a healing one. However, don't assume that you will change anyone's mind; other people are probably just as stubborn as you are now. Instead, alter your own attitude by making room for someone else's position, as well as your own. Consider yourself a soldier of love whose mission is to avoid conflict by being big enough to accept others as they are."
sagittarius,2011-12-06,"Your path forward might grow narrower today, but this doesn't have to prevent you from focusing on the possibilities, rather than the limitations. You might believe that you're being realistic, even if someone thinks that you have lost touch with the truth. However, you could squander an opportunity for success if you waste time worrying about what others think. Instead of endlessly arguing, concentrate your attention on getting ahead."
capricorn,2011-12-06,"Others might attempt to rain on your parade today, but you have enough positivity power to overcome their bad attitudes. You don't need to make a plan to maintain your exuberance, for it will naturally regenerate itself now, assuming you are following your bliss. Don't succumb to coercion or guilt; the more closely your life is aligned to your dreams, the less reactive you are to other people's negativity."
aquarius,2011-12-06,"Someone could be standing between you and your fun today, but the more you engage the resistance, the better the odds of something going wrong. You would be wise to sidestep a brewing conflict because nothing positive will come of a likely stalemate. You won't receive any true satisfaction from winning an argument, so just schedule time with your friends and enjoy the camaraderie while you can."
pisces,2011-12-06,"You're a formidable opponent once your mind is made up and you will steadfastly defend your decision if you are questioned today. Often, you are the one to acquiesce, but now your legendary flexibility is nowhere to be found. Your current strategy is to stubbornly hold still and wait for others to come around to your position. Unfortunately, you're missing the point if you think that there's only one acceptable answer. Meet an adversary halfway and you might discover that you have more in common than you think."
aries,2011-12-07,"Sometimes you cannot be patient, but fortunately you have the good sense to wait today. You know there are good times to be had, but you're not prepared to face the stiff consequences of unfinished responsibilities. An intelligent strategy involves setting a pace that won't wear you out. Working steadily enables you to accomplish your goals, so you can then go out and have a wonderful time without any lingering guilt."
taurus,2011-12-07,"You have an unflappable determination, making it possible to accomplish nearly anything that you set your mind to now. Nevertheless, stating your intention is pointless unless you're willing to follow through by executing your plan. Your certainty may be unshakeable, but you still might need some help getting motivated today. Don't try to handle everything on your own; ask your associates to work with you until you gain sufficient momentum."
gemini,2011-12-07,"You may be picking up strange messages from the cosmos today and this could mess with your sense of reality. At first everything seems copasetic, but then something happens to remind you of how much you don't understand. But rather than wondering about unsolvable mysteries, it's smarter to concentrate your attention on the tasks immediately in front of you. The simple act of finishing a job now will bring more satisfaction than anything else."
cancer,2011-12-07,"Being around other people stimulates your fantasies today, but an active imagination doesn't mean that you want to share your thoughts. Your daydreams may be quite vivid, but you could feel unsure of yourself as you also remember a prior experience when your plan didn't quite make the grade. You might be a little wobbly as you overcome lost confidence. However, there's no need to act any tougher than you are; leaning on your friends reveals them to be the steady pillars that you need."
leo,2011-12-07,"Don't waste any energy doubting yourself today because your intuition is right on track. Unfortunately, your uncertainty could lead you into an argument as you attempt to justify your point of view without the necessary facts at hand. But it doesn't matter whether anyone understands why you have chosen your current path. Just give your presentation your very best and your friends will eventually see the wisdom in what you do."
virgo,2011-12-07,"There's no reason to set your goals very high today, because it's more important that you reach your destination than it is to tire yourself out attempting to go too far. Your wisdom comes from your practicality, which could mean working less and enjoying yourself more. Don't worry if your current productivity is less than what you promised; there is more going on now than meets the eye and you'll make up for lost time in the next few days."
libra,2011-12-07,"You are motivated today by your strong desire for pleasure, especially within the safe boundaries of an intimate relationship. Although someone might believe that you're being lazy now, you're eager to work extra hard if you can see a reward for your efforts. Unfortunately, your attitude may be so out of character that others perceive you as being selfish. Remember, taking care of your own needs is sometimes the best way to replenish your vitality, leaving you with even more to give to those you love."
scorpio,2011-12-07,"A partner or close friend might tell you exactly what he or she thinks you need to know today. You might feel as if everyone's attention on you is turning a simple problem into a more complex one. Few will doubt your ability to overcome an obstacle, but it's still difficult to keep everything in perspective now. Don't become self-righteous or your pompous indignation will only make matters worse. Keep your mind open, even if you don't like what you hear."
sagittarius,2011-12-07,"The Moon's visit to your 6th House of Well-Being has you thinking about making improvements to your health regimen, diet or exercise program. However, little incremental steps are more efficient now than setting larger changes into motion. Don't set yourself up for failure by taking on too much at once. For now, thinking small is better than falsely believing that you're capable of fixing everything at once."
capricorn,2011-12-07,"Jolly Jupiter and the Moon meandering through your 5th House of Fun and Games might distract you from firming up your plans today. Your smartest strategy may not be apparent because this is likely to be a counter-intuitive day. If you feel too good, you could grow lazy while justifying your lack of initiative. But this approach isn't helpful in the long run, even if you can get by without a lot of effort. The real work at hand is to map out your future while your creativity is running high."
aquarius,2011-12-07,"You may be reflecting on your life now and remembering a plan that went wrong or all the times you failed to meet someone's expectations. Thankfully, the memories can also make you smile because you can't help but think about the good times, too. This nostalgic journey could be quite therapeutic and allows you to return to the present moment with an improved attitude and a lighter heart."
pisces,2011-12-07,"The Moon's visit to your 3rd House of Immediate Surroundings indicates that your siblings or closest friends might play a very active role in your life today. Allies could easily step in and give you the support you need to feel safe and secure. But don't take your desire to establish connections too far. If you try too hard, you could inadvertently create a gulf between you and someone special."
aries,2011-12-08,"Enjoying yourself is good for your heart and soul, but even the most pleasurable experience can lose its attraction now if you don't have a sense of purpose. Although there may be nothing specifically wrong today, you still might feel bored and restless. Don't be too judgmental about your current circumstances. It's okay if you want to retreat so you can integrate your most recent lessons before initiating another round of activity."
taurus,2011-12-08,"You might be so rigid today with the Moon in your sign, that you miss out on opportunities that are all around you. However, you may not even realize that your determination can make you stubborn over the wrong issues now. Naturally, you have the power to maintain your position, even if others are pressuring you to change. Just remember to demonstrate your strength of character by being flexible enough to adapt to the current circumstances when it makes sense."
gemini,2011-12-08,"You might have felt that you didn't receive enough benefits from a flurry of recent social activities. But withdrawing to recharge your emotional batteries hasn't been as productive as you had hoped, either. Today you may be longing for new adventures to excite your imagination. You're ready to say yes to nearly anything that sounds like a good time. Just remember to pay attention to your physical needs so you have enough energy for the increased pace in the days ahead."
cancer,2011-12-08,"Your friends and colleagues might not leave you alone today because they want you to join them in activities that are outside your regular routine. Although your first impulse is to turn down an invitation that would only scatter your energy, it's worth giving it a second thought. Rather than wasting time, participating in something different now can inspire you to be more creative in aspects of your work that may have grown boring."
leo,2011-12-08,"New ideas are presented to you today, widening your perspective and encouraging you to reconsider a recent decision. Although you might doubt yourself, you're not necessarily pessimistic about your future; it's just that recent optimism may not have played out as positively as you wanted. Nevertheless, you can be realistic now without ignoring the current opportunities. However, the urgency has passed, so you don't have to act impulsively."
virgo,2011-12-08,"You have big ideas about what the future may bring, yet it's crucial to pay attention to the details that could derail your success. Fortunately, you're able to make a major decision today without worrying about getting it wrong because the Moon's current visit to practical Taurus helps you formulate concrete plans. Use your time wisely now by mapping out your strategy before things become so hectic that you can't think clearly."
libra,2011-12-08,"Your anxiety eases today, allowing you to keep your thoughts to yourself. You aren't driven to set others straight now since the current situation seems to be resolving itself. Instead of engaging in a distracting conversation, you actually want to get to the core of an important issue. Although your motives may be admirable, remember that you don't need to say everything that you think. Be smart and think twice before sharing something that you will soon regret."
scorpio,2011-12-08,"Normally, you have no problem standing up to anyone if they are being obstinate. However, someone might upset you today by successfully justifying his or her opposition to your authority. It might appear that others are just being stubborn, but their resistance could be based on a strong conviction that they have better ideas. Instead of arguing, be magnanimous and walk away; no one will win a fight now. It's a much smarter strategy to wait until tensions settle and everyone is more flexible in their thinking."
sagittarius,2011-12-08,"Although you're often a philosopher and a visionary, you don't seem particularly interested in abstract theories today. But your apparent disinterest in ideas can be misleading with the materialistic Taurus Moon's presence in your 6th House of Details. Your goal is to simplify everything to make any uncertainties more manageable. Focus on tangible outcomes now, for your restlessness could return tomorrow when the Moon is in changeable Gemini."
capricorn,2011-12-08,"It's refreshing to be sailing on calmer waters today, but you're not willing to relax completely since you sense another storm brewing. Although you may have a day or two before the next wave of cosmic stress washes into your life, it's best to prepare now instead of waiting for the action to hit. Don't just accept the status quo; be proactive and seek creative ways to stabilize your position before you're in the middle of more pressure to change."
aquarius,2011-12-08,"Your altruistic purpose may be to light the torch of awareness and lead the way forward, instead of watching others stumble around in the dark. But be careful since you're moving through some pretty tricky territory now. Even your closest allies could suddenly pull back if they think you're being overly judgmental about things you don't understand. This isn't the time to fake it; don't pretend you know more than you do. Expressing your vulnerability enables your peers to trust you enough to partake in the decision-making process."
pisces,2011-12-08,"Consider the impact of your words before you open your mouth or hit send on an email today. Although you may be willing to push yourself in order to have a necessary discussion about a sensitive topic, your feelings might not translate easily into verbal or written language now. Nevertheless, you can miss your chance if you worry about getting every single nuance exactly right. Remember, your current task is to bring the conversation back to the most crucial issues."
aries,2011-12-09,"You're being pulled in several different directions today, making it very difficult to choose a course of action. Ironically, procrastination actually seems like a reasonable strategy because it enables you to keep your options open. But your window of opportunity won't last forever, so don't delay your decision too long. Unfortunately, your innocence can steer you wrong if you believe that adding more alternatives is now your best bet."
taurus,2011-12-09,"If your feelings have been overwhelming recently, today's simplicity goes a long way toward raising your spirits. But it's not prudent to get too excited before you really know all the facts. Although you may be in an easygoing mood, there's still plenty of work to do so you cannot afford to slack off. Even if you are distracted by the temptation of avoiding your responsibilities, it's smarter to stay focused and finish your chores before indulging your desire to kick back and relax."
gemini,2011-12-09,"The Moon's current visit to your restless sign lights a fire under you, inspiring you to swing into action. But running into a small obstacle could be enough to quickly change your mind. It isn't that you're easily discouraged; it's that your attention span is now even shorter than usual. You probably won't be able to keep your thoughts on track today, yet your vigilance does make a big difference. You can still make progress if you keep bringing your focus back to the work at hand."
cancer,2011-12-09,"Your dreams are overflowing into daylight hours as tomorrow's Full Moon Lunar Eclipse grows nearer, making it challenging to separate your facts from fantasy. Thankfully, you draw great inspiration from your imagination, so don't try to suppress any flights of fancy. Unfettered thoughts are like kites today; let them soar on your mental currents, but don't forget that you are holding the string that tethers them to reality."
leo,2011-12-09,"You get excited by thinking about the future with the Moon visiting your 11th House of Goals, but it's difficult to tell if your optimism is warranted. Romance may seem quite real now like a carrot dangling in front of you in order to get you moving. But whatever happens, it is a positive development if you are inspired to take care of business today so you will be ready for whatever happens next."
virgo,2011-12-09,"Clarity is elusive today, even if you analyze all the facts before attempting to make a sensible decision based upon logic. You might be so enamored with what you are learning that you continue to collect all the relevant details that you can synthesize. It's challenging to maintain your confidence, especially if you try to prove your point by throwing more information at the issue. Forget about trying to know what's right; you will be better off by just following your instincts now."
libra,2011-12-09,"You are ready to blast off today because you're so excited about your future. Fortunately, you can use your creativity to transform your intentions into reality. However, it's not wise to take anything for granted now or your dreams could slip away. Keep your feet on the ground and work extra hard if you want to reach your goals."
scorpio,2011-12-09,"You could be feeling anxious today with messenger Mercury and the radiant Sun in futuristic Sagittarius, because you're not interested in the pie-in-the-sky thinking that's inviting you to explore the wide expanses. New possibilities appear on the horizon now, yet pursuing them might be risky business -- and you don't like that. Instead of attempting to plan for the unknown, focus on the present moment so you can see your accomplishments on an ongoing basis."
sagittarius,2011-12-09,"Although you may be feeling stress from a business or personal relationship now, you're sure these issues can be easily handled. However, your current dilemma stems from the fact that you might not know where your life is leading, so you could skip over a significant predicament. Remember, it's healthier to face your concerns when they arise or they can become more complex and harder to manage later on."
capricorn,2011-12-09,"You're a little disoriented today, making it tricky to find your balance. Your tendency is to work at a sustainable pace, while attacking each chore with great deliberation. Unfortunately, this tried and true strategy could fall short of your expectations now. Although it sounds counterintuitive, you can increase your efficiency if you stop planning and begin doing. Even if you have a few false starts, it's still better to find your groove by trial and error."
aquarius,2011-12-09,"Although your day may not unfold according to your agenda, it's not sensible to try too hard to get things back on track today. In fact, sticking to your plan might be a total waste of time that exhausts you without rewarding you with something to show for all your hard work. Instead of driving harder, relax the reins of control but don't squander this opportunity. Use this time to reconsider your desires and re-evaluate what's most important to you."
pisces,2011-12-09,"Your professional goals are shrouded in mysterious clouds now, muddling your perceptions. You may feel as if your energy is low and fear that you won't be able to finish your work on time. Unfortunately, you could worry so much now that your productivity suffers. Don't judge yourself so harshly; you'll gain a clearer sense of what is going on in your world after the Full Moon Lunar Eclipse tomorrow morning."
aries,2011-12-10,"It's challenging to find your groove today because the Gemini Lunar Eclipse rattles your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. However, you may finally establish a sustainable rhythm later in the day once your frustration peaks. It's pointless wasting energy worrying about what you could have done if only you were able to focus sooner. Instead, just do what you can, knowing that your concentration will improve over the days ahead."
taurus,2011-12-10,"Although you probably won't want to deal with financial concerns today, it's wise to attend to money matters with the Gemini Lunar Eclipse stressing your 2nd House of Personal Resources. At least make sure your bills are paid before you purchase a luxury item. It's smart to know exactly how much you have to spend, especially with the holidays rapidly approaching. Keep in mind that the best gifts are the ones that come from the heart and not just the wallet."
gemini,2011-12-10,"You may feel anxious today with the Full Moon Eclipse in your restless sign, especially if you recently made commitments that you're now reconsidering. Your vulnerability leaves you feeling uncomfortable, tempting you to escape by withdrawing socially or running away from an unsatisfactory romantic involvement. Nevertheless, don't make any impulsive moves that could adversely affect a meaningful relationship because your emotions are still in a state of flux."
cancer,2011-12-10,"It's challenging to understand your own feelings today as the Gemini Lunar Eclipse polarizes your 12th House of Fantasy. Although your emotions may be quite intense, frustration is high because words can't express what you want. Don't try so hard to get your message across now. It will be much easier to say what you want tomorrow after the Moon enters your sign and you can speak from your heart."
leo,2011-12-10,"This could be a very social day as the Gemini Full Moon Eclipse energizes your 11th House of Friends. But the stress level may be amplified because you wish you could have quality time with a special companion instead of being one of the group. However, losing yourself in a crowd isn't all bad, for it allows you to maintain some anonymity. But it's a good idea to wait until you're ready before talking about a topic that you're not ready to share."
virgo,2011-12-10,"Today's Full Moon Eclipse in adaptable Gemini stimulates your 10th House of Career, revealing your ambiguity about work these days. You're being pulled in two directions, making it tough to choose a single course of action. Meanwhile, personal activities or projects at home could distract you from professional responsibilities. Postpone major decisions for a few days until you have had more time to think things through."
libra,2011-12-10,"Your desire to go somewhere far away accentuates your restless feelings today as the Gemini Lunar Eclipse activates your 9th House of Adventure. However, the Moon is offset by the Sun in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, giving you good reasons to stay close to home. Don't worry if you can't resolve your current travel dilemma right away. Daydreaming about an incredible journey from the comfort of your couch may be better now than actually taking one at this time."
scorpio,2011-12-10,"You might believe that you have chosen the easier path, only to realize that the Gemini Lunar Eclipse in your 8th House of Deep Sharing has drawn you into a complicated emotional situation. Thankfully, you're quick to establish a healthy perspective; your communication skills come to your aid today as you extricate yourself as gracefully as possible from any unnecessary drama. Remember, it's your choice; only you can decide where you want to direct your energy now."
sagittarius,2011-12-10,"You're focusing on the distance now as you dream and scheme your way into the future. You might wish that nothing was standing in your way, but you still may need to stop and consider someone else's point of view, too. Today's Gemini Full Moon Eclipse shakes your 7th House of Partners, suggesting the presence of an unseen aspect of a relationship that complicates your current plans. Don't make any major decisions until you share your thoughts with those you trust."
capricorn,2011-12-10,"You may have so many chores to do today that you feel pushed and pulled in a variety of directions. The Gemini Full Moon Eclipse in your 6th House of Daily Routine scatters your energy, making it difficult to follow through on any single task. However, you can use your imagination to help create your future. Keep your dreams alive at any cost, even if you're feeling frustrated because of your lack of progress. Don't worry; you will soon regain your focus and continue on your path."
aquarius,2011-12-10,"Today's interactive Gemini Lunar Eclipse stimulates your 5th House of Love and Creativity. Actions usually speak louder than words, but communicating your feelings now is the most direct way to connect with others. But don't get distracted by witty phrases and clever comebacks. Hold on to your vision of what you want to say and keep bringing yourself back to the essential point so that your message is well-received."
pisces,2011-12-10,"You may have community responsibilities today, but the Gemini Full Moon Eclipse in your 4th House of Home and Family encourages you to remember the importance of your personal life, too. Naturally, you must keep up with your worldly obligations, but don't use them as an excuse to evade domestic issues. Balancing your public life with your private affairs helps to minimize problems in the future."
aries,2011-12-11,"You may have a familiar sinking feeling today as you realize that your actions are not supporting your desires. It's no fun to encounter this same dilemma again, yet you're still tempted to take the path of denial by ignoring the message of your heart. Keep in mind that you will be happier once you stop long enough to listen to your emotions. Unfortunately, intuition isn't useful if you keep overriding it with rational thoughts and empty justifications."
taurus,2011-12-11,"You could feel stuck behind a wall of worry as you hold on to old beliefs that aren't relevant to your current situation. Nevertheless, you may still create convincing stories to justify your fears today. But self-doubt isn't helpful and only increases your sense of isolation. Rather than looking back to the past, envision the future just as you wish to see it. Focusing on positive affirmations is smarter now than playing into a more negative outlook."
gemini,2011-12-11,"You don't have to stay in constant motion today, even if you're accustomed to running around. Although you may not be accomplishing much while moving at high speed, you could be pleasantly surprised with all you can get done just by slowing down. However, you might need to make other changes, too. Instead of trying to demonstrate your cleverness to everyone, listening more attentively will probably impress others more."
cancer,2011-12-11,"The Moon returns to your introspective sign today, increasing your sensitivity and making you more aware of your inner process. You're finally able to find the right words to describe how you feel. However, being clear about your needs is complicated because your moods change often now. You may be happy one moment and sad the next, so it's crucial to inform others that your disclosures are true, but your thinking is still in flux."
leo,2011-12-11,"Events may take a turn for the better today, yet you're reminded that everything still takes longer than you expect. You might end up feeling disappointed if you think that you can push the river faster than it's already flowing. However, you should be able to relax a bit once you remember that all water reaches the sea in time. Be smart and allow current events to follow their own natural course without any unnecessary pressure."
virgo,2011-12-11,"Your mental gymnastics could be a way to maintain your illusion of control today. However, there's nothing to be gained now by struggling with your analysis of a crucial issue. Sticking to the facts isn't helpful because important information can come to you through the symbols in your imagination. Obstacles will be easier to overcome once you acknowledge the significance of your dreams even if they don't make sense."
libra,2011-12-11,"You might not normally like to play the role of a mother hen, but the nurturing Cancer Moon is visiting your 10th House of Public Responsibility, encouraging you to stick your nose in everyone else's business. Unfortunately, it's difficult to distinguish between your need to be in control and your well-intentioned desire to help someone. Still, you can derive benefit from your intervention if you're willing to stop to re-examine your motives prior to offering assistance."
scorpio,2011-12-11,"You can feel the rejuvenating effect from the Moon's presence in fellow Water sign Cancer. Unfortunately, you might have been so busy recently that you forgot to check in with your feelings. Thankfully, it's time to reconnect with your own center today. Once you move through your initial resistance, fears will dissipate and your reluctance will morph into the anticipation of what comes next."
sagittarius,2011-12-11,"A difficult emotional encounter isn't usually enough to adversely affect your naturally upbeat attitude, yet you still might forget to count your blessings today. Although you're quite able to sidestep the oncoming negativity, you could feel like a deer trapped by its own fear as it stares into the oncoming headlights. Nevertheless, you are in control of your own destiny and a passionate exchange could put you in touch with an important spiritual truth that leads you out of danger."
capricorn,2011-12-11,"You may grow annoyed if a close friend or partner seems overly needy today. You might even misinterpret someone's emotional behavior as an apparent sign of weakness, especially if you don't want your own feelings to stand in the way of your ambitions. Be careful; suppressing your more vulnerable side creates the wrong impression. Ironically, being open about your discomfort with someone else's problems can actually lead to a deeper and more meaningful relationship."
aquarius,2011-12-11,"You may be worried about how your close friends and family perceive you today, but don't waste any time or energy on brooding. Thankfully, you should receive sufficient support so you can move through your fears pretty quickly. Shifting your focus away from your inner world and onto external events helps you maintain a positive attitude so you can make the most of the day."
pisces,2011-12-11,An unspoken attraction could turn into an obsession today if you are trying to ignore the strong feelings you have for someone special. Avoiding your desires by pretending they don't exist is not a healthy strategy because your secret feelings gain power if they remain in the dark. Just remember that you can acknowledge what you want without necessarily acting on it.
aries,2011-12-12,"It may not be easy to return to work today because the self-protective Cancer Moon encourages you to hide behind an impenetrable wall. You could be worried about a personal matter that pulls some of your attention away from your work. You might even need extra time to take care of family responsibilities, so it's crucial to find ways to increase your efficiency on the job. Completing tasks quicker enables you to gracefully balance your private and public obligations."
taurus,2011-12-12,"It's difficult to stay within your limits today because indulgent Jupiter convinces you that anything is possible. However, your excessive behavior won't likely be apparent to others as the introverted Cancer Moon visits your 3rd House of Communication. Although your judgment is cloudy now, you're likely to err on the side of generosity rather than stinginess. Even if your day doesn't unfold as expected, maintaining a flexible attitude helps to smooth over the rough spots."
gemini,2011-12-12,"Your gut instincts could get in your way of having a good time today, but it isn't a healthy strategy to ignore your feelings for the sake of convenience. If you do, you may become disconnected from your closest friends and co-workers. Sharing your emotions may be awkward at first, but the simple act of communication could be enough to prevent loneliness now. Revealing your vulnerability takes courage, but it's the key to deepening an important relationship."
cancer,2011-12-12,"Expressing your feelings seems more natural today with the Moon camping out in your sign. It's even easier if you are confident about your current course of action. However, others may still be hesitant now, making it difficult to know if they really support your ideas. It's a mistake to take the feedback you receive too personally. Instead of worrying or complaining, get busy and make your plan so awesome that it can't be ignored."
leo,2011-12-12,"It's not time to reveal your feelings yet, for others may not be as trustworthy as they seem now. A co-worker might successfully play off your hopes and entice you to change your mind. Your best strategy today is practicing self-containment; keeping to yourself adds power to your dreams. Make time for your inner work and include others in your process only after you are ready."
virgo,2011-12-12,"It's challenging to stay on track now because your emotions could be at odds with what's happening in your outer world. You may not be feeling very grounded today; your current strategy may fall apart if it's not based upon real business cycles. Thankfully, cutting back on superfluous activities should help you to concentrate on the most important work at hand."
libra,2011-12-12,"You may spend time today contacting a few key colleagues and asking them for their support. Unfortunately, it's not likely that you will get them to commit to your plan, for everyone seems to have an agenda of his or her own. Instead of trying to herd cats, pare back your current aspirations. Simplifying your goals and limiting your conversations to one-on-one encounters increase your chances for success."
scorpio,2011-12-12,"You may be thinking about an upcoming trip, but you're not likely to share your plans yet. You could be afraid that others won't understand your needs and you don't want to waste time justifying your intentions. Additionally, it's more useful to develop your ideas and take them to the next level before dissipating your enthusiasm by responding to any negative judgments. Once you have figured out your itinerary, then you'll be able to talk about it with more confidence."
sagittarius,2011-12-12,"This can be a fairly smooth day, especially if you have figured how to be more comfortable with feelings that may have been causing trouble recently. At first confronting fears that stem from an old relationship wound may seem too overwhelming to face today, but it becomes easier as the day wears on. Interactions with others can take on a life of their own today, yet practicing the art of compromise helps you keep it all together now."
capricorn,2011-12-12,"You want more clarity in relationships now, but the security you crave may be nearly impossible to find if others aren't playing by the same rules of the game. You may feel let down when someone doesn't meet your high expectations for consistency or productivity. Getting your workmates to agree to your deadline today seems like a positive step, but this doesn't mean they will actually deliver on their promises. Patience is necessary and a healthy sense of humor helps during these uncertain times."
aquarius,2011-12-12,"You're feeling out of your element today as illogical emotions swirl around, creating complex currents and subtle nuances that are hard to understand. A simple job might require more time to complete now because you won't want to do things the tried-and-true way. If you can take the courage and enthusiasm you have about experimenting with new methods and use that positivity to jump into an emotional discussion, you may be pleasantly surprised with the outcome."
pisces,2011-12-12,"Your best efforts may be thwarted now, but your willingness to let go of your original course of action can enable you to overcome the current obstacles. Paradoxically, you -- and not the circumstances -- create the limitations today. Unfortunately, working harder won't necessarily bring success; instead, unwavering persistence and a positive attitude is your ticket to the top."
aries,2011-12-13,"Although you might have made plans for today, it's difficult to get started. Activities that sounded like a lot of fun may not look so good now, especially if you're feeling lazy. However, you will feel much better about everything once you finally get going. Allow some time for procrastination, but don't let the whole day slip away before you finally find your rhythm."
taurus,2011-12-13,"You may be eager to kick back and relax today, but responsibilities at work won't let you take it easy. Actually, this could turn into a much more active day than you expected. A late-afternoon flash of inspiration can change your direction and set you on a new path. Fortunately, once you begin your project, your energy begins to grow. But don't jump ahead too quickly or you'll end up making your job more complicated. Establishing a sensible pace now makes your life simpler in the days ahead."
gemini,2011-12-13,"It's best to take care of financial matters early in the day because you might become quite busy later in the afternoon. But instead of just daydreaming about how to make more money, it would be wise to consider ways to reduce your spending. Asking a friend for assistance could make a significant difference in what you accomplish now, for others can offer a much-needed objective perspective. Thinking through all your options helps you to act in a more responsible manner later on."
cancer,2011-12-13,"If you want a bit of peace and quiet today, you may need to be forthright and tell someone to leave you alone. However, your words might be misunderstood, making it doubly important to know exactly what you're going to say before you say it. The way you deliver your message is crucial, so be clear that you're not rejecting anyone. Let everyone know that you need some personal time and that you'll have more to give once you get some well-deserved rest."
leo,2011-12-13,"You may spend the first part of your day wondering if you have enough courage to break from the past. Thankfully, you should be able to establish new patterns for work and play that support your developing view of the world. You don't need to take a giant step now; small steps are healthier. Consider what you can do to improve your health regimen; you might be pleasantly surprised with how such a little change can make such a big difference."
virgo,2011-12-13,"If you're feeling restrained by circumstances today, an unexpected turn of events can release a bit of tension while loosening the reins of control. This change of fate might be triggered by a misunderstanding that forces you to talk about what is actually happening in the present moment. Although you may be uncomfortable with where the conversation is going at first, stick with it. Trust in the process even if you don't know where it will lead."
libra,2011-12-13,"You're typically a better team player than a solo act, yet you're still motivated to prove that you're capable of managing complex events on your own. Some of your co-workers may not even be aware of what you're doing now because you're able to exercise control in a subtle manner. Nevertheless, it takes effort to run the show. Ultimately, you can make your life less complicated by realizing that you don't have to be in charge of everything."
scorpio,2011-12-13,"You may try to appear as if you're not interested in participating in an upcoming social activity, but you still might feel hurt if you're not included. Unfortunately, you can't blame others if they truly believe that they're respecting your wishes by leaving you alone. Thankfully, you can control what happens next by being very clear about exactly what you want."
sagittarius,2011-12-13,"It's tough to set healthy limits today because the Moon squares your key planet Jupiter. You might mistakenly believe that if a small quantity of something special is good, then a larger amount is definitely better. Unfortunately, this kind of thinking could land you in a pile of trouble, especially if you must deal with the consequences of overindulgence. Be smart and stop before it's too late."
capricorn,2011-12-13,"You have serious mojo working on your behalf today, but it's not easy to harness it. If you cannot find something positive to do with your energy, it could turn into frustration. Think twice before losing your temper at someone who probably isn't even the real source of your irritation. Remember that some people aren't as ambitious as you are, so don't impose your will on them. Instead, change your approach and try again."
aquarius,2011-12-13,"You could grow annoyed if someone keeps hounding you with questions or appearing at the same events you attend. Other people want answers now, but all you want to do is chill. Obviously, you have your own goals, but you're not feeling driven to accomplish too much of anything today. Accordingly, it's not too surprising if you rebel against someone who attempts to boss you around. Being diplomatic is preferable, so find ways to say no without offending others."
pisces,2011-12-13,"Your enthusiastic behavior raises the energy level today at any social gathering. Fortunately, others appreciate your active participation now because you are willing to set aside your personal preferences so you can be an integral part of a group. Sacrificing your needs for a good cause is honorable, but it's vital to take time for yourself, too."
aries,2011-12-14,"You aren't in the mood for anyone to tell you what to do today, but your rebellious attitude can create problems if you just do the opposite of whatever you are told. Doing things your way may seem like the best course of action, but your efforts won't lead to a positive outcome now unless you also take time to listen to others. Don't lose track of your long-term goals, but remember to soften your stance so you don't alienate your allies."
taurus,2011-12-14,"At times you are stubborn for no apparent reason, yet you might have a real justification for maintaining the status quo today. Unfortunately, you may find it challenging to explain your motives to others because you're so confident now that you could become overly defensive. Although you're not likely to change your mind, demonstrating a bit of flexibility in your thinking can help you to get what you want."
gemini,2011-12-14,"Your need to interact with others could run into unexpected problems today because everyone seems to have his or her own agenda. Fortunately, you can positively impact the flow of events anyway by concentrating on long-term goals instead of bothersome short-term frustrations. A simple change of perspective alleviates pressures that might otherwise evoke conflict. Tempering a possible extreme reaction improves your chances for success."
cancer,2011-12-14,"Co-workers could come on so strong that you feel like retreating to insulate yourself from them. You don't want to be goaded into making a choice before you're ready to decide for yourself, so you're tempted to withdraw without fully revealing your feelings. However, your fears can exacerbate a tricky situation. Instead of seeking solitude today, it might be wiser to admit your sensitivity and ask your associates to hold off with their judgments until you've had enough time to make up your mind."
leo,2011-12-14,"You may respond to someone's invitation without even thinking now that the reactive Moon is back in your sign. Unfortunately, you might discover that you agreed to more than you intended. If you don't consider what happens next, you could be unhappily surprised that your optimism steered you toward a wrong conclusion. On the other hand, you don't have to be overly cautious if you just remember to temper your natural exuberance with a bit of common sense."
virgo,2011-12-14,"Hiding your feelings isn't the best approach to managing a strong emotional interaction today. You are more transparent than you think, and others probably won't trust you if they see that you aren't being honest with them. Don't wait until your frustration reaches a critical level before saying what's on your mind. Avoiding an argument is easy now if you remember to share your reactions calmly before they grow out of control."
libra,2011-12-14,"Your need to please others can lead to fun today as long as you aren't acting for a selfish reason. But if you're only considering what's advantageous for you, your expectations may get in the way of a wonderful experience. Ultimately, you might be struggling with control issues now, so try letting go of your attachment to any desired outcome. If you are simply responsive without promoting your agenda, you may end up with more than you thought possible."
scorpio,2011-12-14,"You might believe that you have to stand strong today, but your worries about being judged harshly could prompt you to overstate your perspective. You may even be so rigid in your presentation that others pull away from you because they think there's not enough room in your position for negotiation. Fortunately, you can soften your message without weakening your conviction. Keep in mind that someone's alternative point of view doesn't necessarily threaten yours."
sagittarius,2011-12-14,"Your optimism has returned now that Mercury is moving direct in your sign, and you may not have the patience to listen to anyone else's negativity about your plans. If someone is dissatisfied with your agenda today, you could be tempted to just take off and do your own thing. Nevertheless, it's not wise to react so quickly if it means that you are excluding others. Take a few deep breaths and give them time to come around because it will be more fun to play in a group."
capricorn,2011-12-14,"It might seem as if someone is exerting unnecessary influence over you today and it doesn't feel right. Instead of avoiding a confrontation by retreating, you're annoyed enough to face it head-on -- especially if you know that you are right. However, you could inadvertently create a situation where being a winner makes someone else a loser. Rather than sinking into unnecessary competition now, change the framework into a cooperative one where everyone comes out ahead."
aquarius,2011-12-14,"You like it when someone is clear about his or her needs, but you're not as supportive if a friend or co-worker is acting selfishly today. You may try to maintain your positive attitude, but you might respond with forceful words if someone pushes you too hard. It's your decision; you don't have to encourage conflict. You have the power to deflect aggression by quietly holding on to your position and waiting things out."
pisces,2011-12-14,"You may feel the need to put on a show at work today because you want to be noticed for your contributions. But instead of drawing attention to yourself, just go about your business because completing your chores and fulfilling your obligations will garner more support than empty shenanigans. In the long run doing your job well brings you more recognition than shining a spotlight on yourself."
aries,2011-12-15,"The bold Leo Moon's presence in your 5th House of Love and Creativity empowers you to make time for an artistic project or to pursue a romantic interest. Either way, you're eager to express what's in your heart today. However, your plan may run into problems if you don't clearly define what you want. If you are specific when describing your needs now, your chances for fulfillment are much better."
taurus,2011-12-15,"A complicated relationship may turn sour for a short while today, but this is no cause for worry because things will probably improve pretty quickly. You might feel as if you are trying to adjust to the current instability of a partnership, but your anxiety won't go away until you gain more security. It's difficult to know how much to talk about and how much you should keep to yourself. Begin slowly; you can always take the conversation to the next level later on."
gemini,2011-12-15,"Even if you are normally easygoing, you're more irritated today if others don't realize that you are taking on more responsibilities. Although you wish that you could leave work early, you may need to pitch in to cover for someone's lack of productivity. But don't blame anyone else; just keep doing what makes the most sense for the good of everyone involved. Set aside your personal preferences now to demonstrate your willingness to be a team player."
cancer,2011-12-15,"You may feel good about what's happening at work today, but you still must deal with a personal financial issue or you won't be able to relax. Others might not be too sympathetic to your current plight at first because they only see your positive side and the productive results of your efforts. Nevertheless, it isn't helpful to cover up your fiscal concerns. Sharing your worries can deepen a relationship, but you still must take care of the practical issues on your own."
leo,2011-12-15,"You're able to charm your way through an awkward situation today, provided that you don't act as if everything is all about you. Although it may be challenging to widen your perspective to include other people's points of view, you still must try if you want to be successful now. Your chances of overcoming adversity increase if you are also sensitive to the needs of those closest to you."
virgo,2011-12-15,"You may feel as if you're at the end of your rope now, but you're not ready to let go yet. Nevertheless, you might be required to eliminate an outmoded emotional habit to alleviate your stress today. You could believe that making a few minor adjustments will allow you to move on, but more drastic measures will probably be necessary. Don't wait; address the big picture while you still have time."
libra,2011-12-15,"You may be thrilled with the possibility of negotiating a manageable truce in your life as you stand between opposing factions. This could be as simple as settling a family argument or as complex as working out the details to an international treaty. Either way, it becomes more apparent as you get further into the process that establishing common ground isn't all that easy today. Don't get too discouraged now if it takes longer than you expect to broker a solution."
scorpio,2011-12-15,"Your workmates may be pressuring you to participate in a group activity today, but you don't want to be distracted from taking care of unfinished personal business. Fortunately, you're able to maintain the status quo, even if you must speak a few harsh words to make yourself clear. Thankfully, others should back off enough to give you the room you need once you express what's on your mind."
sagittarius,2011-12-15,"You are pretty clear about what you want to do next, but you may also need to acknowledge the possibility that you're overstepping your limits or someone else's boundaries today. Overextending yourself isn't helpful on your quest; you won't reach your goals any faster. It's smarter to demonstrate a bit of self-restraint now, rather than waiting for reality to stop you in your tracks."
capricorn,2011-12-15,"You can grow anxious when someone's expecting you to put on a show. Whether you're supposed to give a professional presentation or just casually entertain at a party, you're not that interested in being in the public spotlight now. However, hiding in the shadows isn't in your best interest today. Change your attitude and stay open to any recognition that you receive, because a little fame can bring good fortune down the road."
aquarius,2011-12-15,"It may appear that others are encouraging you now, but as you start to put your plan into motion, they might decide to not show up. This is tricky territory because you can't just go chasing after the approval you want today, for the more you pursue it, the faster it recedes. Remember that the urgency is only within your mind; you have more time than you think."
pisces,2011-12-15,You may be getting tired of showing up with a smile at work and still being told that you're the negative one. You believe that others might be projecting their fears onto you and you don't want to take it any longer. But it doesn't matter who is in the right; everyone involved needs to step back from the current situation to get some breathing room. Let the dust settle for a couple of days before jumping back into the fray.
aries,2011-12-16,"If you have been thinking about purchasing something special for yourself, you might impulsively decide to buy it today. However, your standards are rigid now, so it's necessary to convince yourself that your current acquisition is not frivolous. It's better to spend your money on tools for work than on something you don't really need. Ultimately, it's wiser to conserve your resources, so don't be afraid to buck the tide and say no."
taurus,2011-12-16,"Although you want to put your life back in order, you probably can't regain control over everything today. Your pragmatic common sense tells you to be cautious, but friends are encouraging you to make commitments without worrying about fulfilling them until later on. You might be able to improve your production pace by squeezing out a little more effort every day; however the possible negative impact on your life isn't worth the tradeoff. Once you choose your priorities, establish clear boundaries so that everyone knows exactly what to expect."
gemini,2011-12-16,"You may believe that staying in motion keeps you relatively safe, as if instant karma can't hit you while you're moving. Even if you are enthused about living in such a dynamic time, you can grow tired of having to always be on the run. You might notice today that you're longing for more relaxing times. Fortunately, you have the power to make the choice to wean yourself from high-adrenaline situations so you are able to live a longer and happier life. Be proactive and start now."
cancer,2011-12-16,"You might be tempted to jump into a project at work today if you have already created a detailed plan to ensure your success. You can manage your resources well, even if your friends pull you in several directions. It's extremely difficult to pass by an opportunity that looks too good to ignore. However, following your instincts could lead to trouble if you wander too far off track. Avoid the disappointment that comes from overindulging your fantasies by buckling down and following your agenda, instead."
leo,2011-12-16,"You may be able to visualize the finished results on a big project today, yet any attempts to take a shortcut could be met with swift retribution. It's a smart strategy to move past the flush of excitement about a new career direction so you can get down to serious business now. Don't dilly-dally; it's time to build a solid foundation in order to reach your impressive goals."
virgo,2011-12-16,"You're rejuvenated by the Moon's return to practical Virgo and can now create a strategy for living defensively. Although green lights seem to appear at every intersection today, you are wise to tap the brakes and look each way before continuing on. Don't be distracted by good news; even if your future is looking fantastic, stop to check your map before blindly driving forward."
libra,2011-12-16,"Your extravagant behavior today may be an overreaction to hide your fears about what's ahead. Fortunately, you could realize the extraordinary effect that your thoughts have on the future, leading you to choose fun and games over doom and gloom. Nevertheless, your attention is also required on matters of deeper concern, so don't go off and bury your head in the sand. Balance optimism with realism for optimum results."
scorpio,2011-12-16,"You may think that you would be better off training for the marathon of your life that you believe is just ahead. But you might also conclude that it's a good idea to enjoy yourself while you can, for you don't really know what's around the next corner. While considering these opposite perspectives, remember that your point of view continues to change, too, so every decision needs to stand on its own merits."
sagittarius,2011-12-16,"Your optimistic outlook is encouraged by eager Mars' aspect to your key planet Jupiter. Although you want more facts today, you might not have time to properly integrate them into your plan. However, you also want to establish new priorities to reduce the stress of having too much data. Instead of reaching out even further, limit your field of possibilities and take steps to utilize what you already know."
capricorn,2011-12-16,"You may believe that you're regaining your stability now, just as a wave of big ideas washes in to sweep you off your feet. Ironically, you're optimistic about your future, even if the current circumstances feel unsettling. Be careful about what you believe, for you could be influenced by those who seek blind support for the party line. Instead of following the herd, think for yourself and draw your own conclusions."
aquarius,2011-12-16,"Although your future is looking better all the time, it's wise to tread carefully since you could be building your strategy on incomplete data. Receiving praise from a powerful person is wonderful, but others may have their own reasons for giving you positive feedback now. Maintain a healthy attitude about your work, but don't allow your strong desire for success to cast a rosy glow over reality. A practical approach will serve you much better than running from the truth."
pisces,2011-12-16,"Your friend or co-worker may be overly critical of your actions today, but you might disregard other people's negative comments because you think they're being unrealistic or judgmental. Instead of learning from constructive feedback, you're tempted to discredit anyone who doesn't support your efforts. Keep in mind that your apparent adversaries could be much more helpful than you realize, so listen to the advice you receive and use it to make your position even stronger."
aries,2011-12-17,"Knowing exactly what you want to accomplish today may not be sufficient, for you must also have a workable plan to reach your goals. It could be difficult to break down a major project into manageable steps, but this is the best way to ensure finishing what you start. However, avoid temptations to measure your progress for a day or two. You may be pleasantly surprised by what you can get done when you don't worry so much about the results."
taurus,2011-12-17,"You can take time to enjoy yourself today if you make sure that you keep your goals relatively simple. However, don't just assume that you can skip out on your obligations. You may be tempted to avoid an unpleasant task or leave it for tomorrow. Unfortunately, circumstances can be unforgiving now, so work as hard as you can to complete your chores before going out to play."
gemini,2011-12-17,"It's difficult for others to pin you down today. You aren't likely to share too many details of your inner process now because you could be fearful that someone will expect more than you're able to deliver. However, your worries are likely unfounded. Rather, it's your tendency to avoid making a commitment that encourages your friends to want more particulars. Nevertheless, it's not wise to hold back; you're better off saying what's on your mind, even if it's not what anyone wants to hear."
cancer,2011-12-17,"You may take extra steps to confirm your schedule with others to prevent anything from going wrong today. Unfortunately, your advanced planning could end up having the opposite effect; too much attention to detail now can create a lack of flexibility and become an open invitation for a late appointment or missed event. Add plenty of extra time into your daily calendar so it won't fall apart like a house of cards."
leo,2011-12-17,"Instead of beginning a new project today, it's smarter to build on something you've already started. Even if you're bored with whatever you are doing now, don't slip into the trap of believing that you can have more fun if you were only playing an entirely different game. Changing your current direction won't necessarily make you any happier; in fact, you only have to change your mind. A positive attitude makes you a better team player."
virgo,2011-12-17,"It's natural for you to focus on each individual component of a project, but today you might become so involved with what you're doing that you lose track of your overall goals. Finding balance between narrow concentration and global thinking may be a familiar trouble spot, but now you're aware of the problems that can arise when going to either extreme. It may not be easy, but you should be able to accomplish more if you can keep both perspectives in your current awareness."
libra,2011-12-17,"You might not want to continue on the same trajectory because you're looking for a new adventure. It may be easy to make changes within the confines of your fantasies, but it's more difficult to do it in the real world. Dreaming about your ideal future helps you feel better in the present moment, but you have to return to reality sooner or later. Thankfully, a very small modification to your current behavior may be all that's needed to alter your direction."
scorpio,2011-12-17,"Your friends might think that they're supporting you, but you may not be happy with the way they show it today. You prefer one hundred percent honesty, yet you really don't like anyone telling you what to do. If you have already made up your mind, you want others to offer constructive advice now rather than being a Monday-morning quarterback. Nevertheless, you may be wiser to accept that they mean well and be thankful for their concern."
sagittarius,2011-12-17,"It's complicated to set specific goals now, and even more difficult to gauge how you are doing. Even if you believe that you know your destination, you can't tell whether or not you're making progress unless you set measurable milestones along the way. Don't wait until the end to see if you're successful. Instead, break down your project into small manageable tasks and step through them one at a time."
capricorn,2011-12-17,"It's crucial to balance your long-term goals with what's already on your calendar for today. However, you still must work with others and they may not possess the same level of clarity that you do. Although you intuitively know what's right, it's challenging now to explain your choices to anyone else. Don't waste your energy trying to justify your behavior; just go ahead and do what's necessary. You can always share your logic after the fact if you are so inclined."
aquarius,2011-12-17,"You may be more interested in convincing others to work with you on a pet project today. Even if you don't have to involve anyone else in your decision-making process, you can gain benefit by enlisting the approval of your friends or family. Don't assume too much or you'll feel discouraged if your goals aren't supported by your peers. Avoid disappointment by sharing your plans and then listening carefully to the feedback you receive."
pisces,2011-12-17,"It's nearly impossible to know how much effort you should put toward garnering support for your long-term goals. You can sound desperate if you're overly insistent, making others less eager to help you today if you demonstrate a lack of confidence. It could be just as problematic if you're so cocky that you appear totally self-sufficient. Remember, positive thought is powerful and works in your favor now if you're clear about your intentions when asking for assistance."
aries,2011-12-18,"You might prefer to be a hermit today, but obligations that involve others may get in your way. You don't mind being with someone you like, but it seems as if even your best friends are making too many demands on you now. Although you are socially oriented by nature, it's healthier to get in touch with your own needs than to be distracted by trying to meet another person's expectations. Spend some time by yourself so you can feel better about interpersonal relationships later on."
taurus,2011-12-18,"You may acknowledge that slowing down is healthy, but you resent the limitations that your current commitments are placing on you. Instead of stubbornly fighting the resistance you face today, just let go of your personal agenda for a while. The path ahead will open for you when you aren't pressuring everyone to follow your plan. Relax and go with the flow."
gemini,2011-12-18,"You don't seem to be very interested in listening to other people's criticism today. It isn't that your beliefs are based upon idealistic fantasies; it's just that you can see the flaws in a current relationship as well as anyone else. But you know that your feelings come and go, like the rising and falling of the tides, so it's pointless to struggle against strong currents. It may be wiser to wait for the tide to change before announcing your intentions."
cancer,2011-12-18,"Although others seem to go out of their way to be nice to you now, you can intuitively sense if they're being shallow and just saying positive things to get attention. However, they may genuinely want to be your friend. Moving past your fears and expressing your concerns will force the issue, enabling you to see if your initial resistance was well founded. Be honest; it's more important to maintain your integrity than to keep up appearances."
leo,2011-12-18,"There may be noticeable forward movement concerning your finances today, but things still aren't progressing as fast as you wish. Everything is taking more time than it should, so nothing you do seems to have the desired effect. But rather than being too self-critical or getting frustrated, a smarter strategy now might be to retreat. Stop chasing your tail for no reason; instead, be kind to yourself and replenish your energy reserves."
virgo,2011-12-18,"Self-doubt leads you to reconsider a decision made recently, especially if you weren't being realistic about your abilities. Your assumptions may be irrational and your expectations exaggerated, since you were looking at your life through rose-colored glasses. However, now you're beginning to see things in their proper light again. Don't give up prematurely; you might be discouraged today, yet the situation will likely work out beneficially in the long run."
libra,2011-12-18,"These days may not flow easily, but even with the holiday distractions you are more concerned with your work and family issues. Paradoxically, you could look back on this time with great appreciation for everything you had to endure. Nevertheless, circumstances are forcing you to make much-needed constructive changes. Don't waste energy fighting the inevitable. Letting go of control helps makes room for whatever comes next."
scorpio,2011-12-18,"If you are a harsh judge of yourself or others, you could inadvertently push someone away. But no matter what you do today, fate will ultimately play a deciding role in the outcome of events. It's futile to limit your options, even if you cannot see the positive potential in the current situation. Instead of placing so much attention on what could happen, just go along for the ride. Most minor problems seem bigger now than they really are and will resolve naturally in just a few days."
sagittarius,2011-12-18,"You could be having a tough time now keeping up with everyone in your life. Some of your peers seem to be moving faster than you are today, yet you aren't overly motivated to catch up. You finally realize that everyone has a different role to play, so you really don't need to maintain the hectic pace unless it's warranted. It's difficult acknowledging that you can't do everything you wanted to do. However, letting go of dreams that have not panned out will make you happier in the long run."
capricorn,2011-12-18,"Your pragmatic outlook on life enables you to be less emotional about cutting your losses and moving on. However, it's not wise to act too quickly because your key planet Saturn squares delicious Venus, subduing your pleasures and delaying real gratification. You may sell yourself short now, so wait a few days before making a significant agreement. Although the odds don't appear to be in your favor today, the energy will shift in a few days."
aquarius,2011-12-18,"It's not wise to pin your hopes for personal satisfaction on a romantic relationship now because you would be better off to aim for a higher expression of love. Sensual enjoyment isn't out of the question, but a deeper and more spiritual connection can bring you greater happiness. Even if the fulfillment of a wonderful fantasy seems out of reach, don't let that stop you from aspiring toward becoming a more compassionate person."
pisces,2011-12-18,"It's hard to get into the holiday spirit today, even though the season is drawing near. Unfortunately, you might feel as if you missed the rocket ship that was scheduled to carry you into next year. But you're not ready to let go of old dreams, even if you're feeling disappointed. Your vision is being tested; don't take the easy way out by just discarding what's important to you. Keep the faith, no matter what."
aries,2011-12-19,"You may believe that someone's blocking your path to happiness today, but this point of view could be your way to avoid taking responsibility. Don't place blame on others; instead, look within to gain understanding about your causal role in the present situation. Ironically, altering your own attitude might be the most sensible way to improve your current circumstances."
taurus,2011-12-19,"You might think that you don't have many options today. Fortunately, your willingness to work within the restraints of the current situation makes your life easier until you can figure out how to make some changes. You may be patient, but you won't be able to continue holding out for too long. There's no need to give up your power now and just accept the status quo; instead, take a risk if you are sure that you know what you want."
gemini,2011-12-19,"You may be tempted to play today, but you won't likely be able to take time off for fun. You are driven to keep your guard up now as you're pulled from one unstable demanding situation to the next, without much time in between. Thankfully, you still can have a stabilizing impact on others if you set your personal desires aside so you can focus on the common good."
cancer,2011-12-19,"Your personal concerns take center stage today and dealing with them could distract you from your job. You might try to overcompensate by showing others how willing you are to cooperate with them, but they could misinterpret your flexibility as a sign of disinterest. It's not wise to keep to yourself while taking the course of least resistance. Explain your position as succinctly as possible before you relinquish control."
leo,2011-12-19,"You might feel as if you're not in a position to get exactly what you want, but you still could feel satisfied. It's not likely that you'll be able to leverage your position to come out on top, but, fortunately, you probably won't go down in defeat either. Whatever happens now, remember that there will be time in the next few days to reclaim any ground you've lost."
virgo,2011-12-19,"Your ruling planet Mercury is up to his trickster games today as he aspects confident Jupiter. You might think that things are looking good, only to discover that you inadvertently glossed over an important detail. Even if you know what's happening, more is going on than meets the eye. If possible, delay important decisions now, because a renewed sense of clarity will return by the weekend."
libra,2011-12-19,"You may be known for your indecisiveness, but today you are sure of what you need. Don't hold back now; let others know your preferences, even if they might want something else. Conflict clashes with your diplomatic style, but at least you have the tools to stand up for yourself. Think about what you are going to say before starting to talk. You could be happily surprised when your wish comes true."
scorpio,2011-12-19,"Today can be an important day for your finances, but you must be willing to stand up and state your needs clearly. If you don't let others know about your goals, they are free to make incorrect assumptions. But don't let the rules of social etiquette get in your way; speak your truth as directly as you can. Others will appreciate your honesty if you take a risk and share your point of view without editing it for political correctness. You may upset someone by stirring things up, but that is exactly what is needed now."
sagittarius,2011-12-19,"If you're uncomfortable with the high level of concentration that your current work assignment requires, consider the source of your uneasiness. You might not appreciate how you're being managed, or, perhaps, you're just bored with your job. Your restlessness is heightened by your inventive ideas now, especially if you have no easy way to share them. Instead of climbing too far out on a limb and telling the whole story, write it down and save it for another day when your message can have positive impact."
capricorn,2011-12-19,"You take your work very seriously and prefer to know that you are correct before you share your opinions. You want others to believe that you're reliable, but now your thoughts are a bit erratic and you may not trust your instincts. Actually, you're able to think outside the box today, making your current ideas very original. Unfortunately, they may also be a bit spacey. Keep your visions to yourself for a few more days to see how they stand up to the test of time."
aquarius,2011-12-19,"Someone is not playing fairly today and there isn't a lot that you can do about it yet. A co-worker may have hidden motives for whatever scheme he or she is plotting. Don't try to force the issue even if you believe that something important is being kept from you. Stop struggling; instead, let the events play out on their own. Everything you need to know will become obvious in time."
pisces,2011-12-19,"You may be the rebel in your group today, but you might not be aware of your role yet. If you're working with a team, everyone else may seem more conservative than you are. You don't intend to create trouble, but something you say could inadvertently let the truth slip out. Remember, once you speak your mind, you cannot take it back. But don't worry; you will feel better after everything is out in the open."
aries,2011-12-20,"It's no easy task to keep your feet on the ground today, for you're tempted to set aside the basic facts to follow an unrealistic daydream filled with rainbows and unicorns. Ignoring the truth may sound like a good idea, but you cannot escape your responsibilities by just sliding off into another dimension. However, if you have the courage to be fully authentic, you can still make use of your imagination without having to fool yourself or anyone else."
taurus,2011-12-20,"You're pulled in two directions today; you want to take care of serious issues as they arise, yet you also want to put them off until a later time. Your natural no-nonsense approach inspires you to handle unfinished business immediately, but you're at the mercy of your ruling planet Venus now as she attracts you to more pleasurable pursuits. Luckily, you can get away with some mischief as long as you still get your work done."
gemini,2011-12-20,"Your life seems less complicated today, and you may relax your concerns about how you are going to make everything work. You can feel the lighter energy blowing in as likeable Venus enters fellow Air sign Aquarius, enabling you to see the upside of almost any situation. Your positive attitude contributes to your success as long as you don't overstep your limits by ignoring what is obvious. Focus on the truth instead of the easy way out."
cancer,2011-12-20,"Your instincts are functioning at a highly efficient level now that the Moon is in perceptive Scorpio. But you still might try to suppress your intuition if you're drawn to pursuing pleasure instead of the truth. You would be happier with solid data on which to build your plan, but objectivity is elusive as fantasies seep into the real world today. Hard cold facts can only take you so far, yet your creativity can carry you wherever you want to go."
leo,2011-12-20,"You are more interested now in delving into the mysteries of the cosmos to learn what's going on beneath the surface. But this metaphysical attraction is at odds with a more primal desire that arises from the pleasures of the senses. Emotional detachment sounds like a smart strategy, but dreams of deeper intimacy lure you back into your body. Remember, more isn't always better. You'll be happier if you can simply enjoy a rainbow without having to dig for a pot of gold, too."
virgo,2011-12-20,"Work is more enjoyable now that lovely Venus is visiting your 6th House of Employment. You could encounter opportunities to develop new friendships or even become romantically attracted to someone you meet through your job. However, others may grow more emotionally attached than you prefer, which might motivate you to withdraw. Nevertheless, you will be happier in the long run if you slow down to cultivate enduring relationships rather than those that quickly come and go."
libra,2011-12-20,"Your ruling planet Venus -- the goddess of love -- enters futuristic Aquarius and your 5th House of Romance today, re-energizing a current relationship or catalyzing a new one. This is likely to be a joyful time, but you could lessen your chances for happiness if you become overly attached. Enjoy the thrills and chills of fun and games without letting your emotions get in the way."
scorpio,2011-12-20,"The Moon's shift into your sign reminds you of the importance of developing new priorities for your partnerships. Unfortunately, it's hard to find a sensible way to get what you want. You might have had your heart set on an intense relationship, yet compassion is now overtaking passion as your top priority. But don't worry; this is merely a passing phase that enables you to diminish excess emotional distractions so you can reconnect with your inner self."
sagittarius,2011-12-20,"Although you may have to go to work today, you're not eager to jump into the fray. You like the idea of professional camaraderie, but it could be a struggle to get excited about anything beyond the social distractions. Don't be too self-critical if you are not able to get a lot done now. Give yourself permission to have a little fun if you can. You will have a chance to make up for your current lack of productivity later in the week."
capricorn,2011-12-20,"You might struggle with an ongoing shift of power in your business world because you are so deeply entrenched in the status quo. Even if you like the idea of stirring things up, the uncertainty still makes you nervous. Just remember that you cannot stop the wheels of progress. Give yourself a gift of a few more days to make a major decision. Once you make up your mind, you can assume an important leadership role in the transformation."
aquarius,2011-12-20,"It feels as if you are granted a reprieve because you are given more time to reach your goals. Thankfully, you're very optimistic about your chances for success, so you can play it cool without worrying about making a big life change. There's no reason to panic or get everything finished right away, but there's also no need to play it too cool. Just follow your instincts and let your charm do its magic, now that friendly Venus is back in your sign. Instead of pushing too hard on anything today, follow the course of least resistance."
pisces,2011-12-20,"Vulnerable Venus slips into your 12th House of Spirituality today, shifting your priorities for the next three weeks and offsetting your desires to distract yourself in sensory pleasures. Opening to love can heal old emotional wounds, but you could take your enthusiasm too far. Indulging in your favorite daydreams is addictive, so it's important to balance your fantasies with reality. However, logic certainly won't reveal all the answers, either. Ultimately, your best strategy now is to narrow the gulf between your head and heart."
aries,2011-12-21,"You have responsibilities that are probably more important than socializing today, but an unusual invitation from an interesting person could make it difficult to say no. You like the idea of stretching your horizons now, so you will likely grab any opportunity that sounds good. Work diligently first so you don't feel guilty about ignoring your commitments when you're having fun later."
taurus,2011-12-21,"You may have to respond to an unexpected change of plans today, but fortunately, you see this twist of fate as a positive event. You have the stamina to handle nearly anything that comes your way now, along with an uncanny ability to know when to be patient. Have faith in your intuition and don't allow rationalizations to override your gut feelings."
gemini,2011-12-21,"It's typical for you to have a plan in place, yet still change your mind at the last moment. Co-workers might not understand your reasons for altering your priorities, but there is usually logic to your thinking. It's useful to make certain that you're not just taking the easy way out today. If your new strategy is really an improvement, don't hesitate before going for it. And, don't waste precious time and energy trying to justify your actions to everyone else."
cancer,2011-12-21,"You might actually scare yourself today because of your sudden willingness to gamble. However, taking a calculated risk may be your smartest move, even if someone attempts to convince you of the error of your ways. Consider the consequences of inaction. The fear of failure isn't as bad as the regret of not trying at all. It's time to overcome your internal resistance and follow your heart."
leo,2011-12-21,"You may discover untapped resources if you're willing to fully commit to a single goal. However, it will be necessary to dig deeply into your arsenal and acknowledge that you're playing for keeps -- especially if you are certain that you know what you want. If you're not sure, it's wiser to wait a day or two. Don't be afraid to stubbornly hold your ground, even if a big change is looming just around the corner."
virgo,2011-12-21,"You might have a hard time deciding if you should go ahead with your plans now because the pros and cons are pretty evenly balanced. However, if you finally choose against pushing ahead today, you could surprise yourself by impulsively taking the next step, anyhow. Exercise reasonable caution; if you initiate action prematurely, you may have to start over next week."
libra,2011-12-21,"You might have an unusual inspiration today about how to spice up a relationship that has become entrenched in routine. But you may worry so much about upsetting the status quo that you quickly dismiss your radical new ideas. Unfortunately, you'll never know whether or not they work if you're not willing to try them. Be innovative; you can return to your old ways if your plans don't work out according to your wishes."
scorpio,2011-12-21,"Being creative leads you to success on the job or, at least, recognition by your peers. This is an exciting time, but you need to establish a pace that you can sustain. Although you may have lots of good ideas today, it's not helpful in the long run to make a one-time big splash. Save your showy presentation for another day; for now, impress others by demonstrating your ability to finish whatever you start."
sagittarius,2011-12-21,"You may be able to get away with a bit of mischief today because others are likely to forgive your edgy behavior. The Sun's last day in philosophical Sagittarius helps your contemplative nature shine through for everyone to see. Thankfully, your eagerness to risk your stability by doing things your way clearly demonstrates your intent to succeed without sacrificing your integrity. You can still act responsibly and remain true to your values now while being a nonconformist."
capricorn,2011-12-21,"You are riding a wave that's growing in strength, yet you need to slow down or you might squander a rare opportunity. Being an inspiring leader is challenging now if you're overly eager to reach a goal, especially if you cannot restrain your enthusiasm. Don't just bolt ahead of those who should be following you; instead, move at a pace that allows others to be a part of the process."
aquarius,2011-12-21,"It's nearly impossible to hide your intentions from others today with the Moon's presence in your public 10th house. Even if you think it's smart to keep your feelings to yourself, an unexpected turn of events might require you to think on your feet and involve others in your process. Sharing your dreams takes courage, but revealing your vulnerability can remove unnecessary boundaries between you and your associates."
pisces,2011-12-21,"Even if your emotions make complete sense to you, there might be trouble today when you tell others what you want. Misunderstandings may occur if you become so excited about your plans that you bounce from thought to thought. A smarter strategy now is to work quietly toward your goals and wait a few more days before sharing your plans with anyone else."
aries,2011-12-22,"You cannot contain your excitement today as the barriers to pursuing your happiness fall away. Although you may be high on anticipation about your upcoming adventures, satisfaction might not be as close as you expect. Don't be cavalier about the complexities you must still overcome. If you are serious about your goals, you just might be able to execute your plans successfully."
taurus,2011-12-22,"Last minute social commitments might add a bit of stress to your day by placing too many demands on your time. Although you're capable of stretching beyond your usual limits today, don't reach so far that you upset the balance between work and play. Being open to the spirit of the holiday season is fine, but don't be afraid to retreat if your common sense tells you that you are overextended."
gemini,2011-12-22,"It's tempting to go along with someone's idea today because you are more concerned with enjoying yourself than with achieving success. Fortunately, the Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions can amplify the strength of another person's strategy, further encouraging you to let go of your previous plans. Your cooperative spirit enables you to work well with others now, bringing greater satisfaction than doing something on your own."
cancer,2011-12-22,"Although you're optimistic about what you can accomplish at work today, your expectations might be somewhat unrealistic. Streamline your to-do list before wasting lots of energy on tasks you can't finish. Instead of spreading yourself too thin, focus on completing a few of the most important tasks; otherwise, you could exhaust yourself before the day is done."
leo,2011-12-22,"You are feeling very creative today as the buoyant Sagittarius Moon enters your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, you aren't in the mood to perform the repetitive tasks that may still be required. Be careful about reacting too impulsively because your frustration could explode into an emotional outbreak that turns your day upside down. Although it might be challenging to be patient now, it's best to save your greatest inspiration for your personal pleasure."
virgo,2011-12-22,"You may believe that you can accomplish everything today, but your schedule could fall apart if someone's need for independence clashes with your agenda. You might have to reinvent your day on the fly or postpone tasks when something requires more time than you expected. Your emotional reaction could upset a close friend or loved one, but your reassurances should be able to settle them down. Make sure everyone knows that you still plan to meet your obligations over the next few days."
libra,2011-12-22,"If you try to stuff one more activity into this day, it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. But you might not realize that anything has gone wrong until it's too late. Even if you are quite confident that all is well in your world, it's still smart to lighten up your calendar before you find yourself in trouble. If you stretch your commitments too far, the entire house of cards may need to fall in order to alleviate the tension."
scorpio,2011-12-22,"Exercising financial caution is wise today because the optimistic Sagittarius Moon in your 2nd House of Possessions encourages you to spend more than you should. Your money may be more limited than you want to admit, so budgeting your resources makes good sense. It's smarter to acknowledge how you can fool yourself before you end up facing an unnecessary negative cash flow situation. Fortunately, a little planning goes a long way to ease your concerns."
sagittarius,2011-12-22,"You are riding a wave of self-confidence, but it's also easy to gloss over practical details that can get you into trouble today. Relying on your common sense now instead of your optimism is a good idea, but it's not easy to keep your feet on the ground. Your visionary powers are strong, tricking you to think that you're invincible. Positive thinking will improve the situation, but ignoring the facts makes things worse. Don't avoid reality just because it's unpleasant."
capricorn,2011-12-22,"You may try to be rational in your approach to a complicated situation now that the Sun is shining in your sensible sign. Unfortunately, the current circumstances can defy logical analysis. Instead of unsuccessfully attempting to stay on the straight and narrow path, give yourself permission to be inspired by your imagination. Don't try to justify your choices to anyone; simply trust in the process. Your intuition will not steer you wrong today."
aquarius,2011-12-22,"Your dreams may be the source of inspiration today, but they can also lead you in a more practical direction than you realize. The Moon's visit to your 11th House of Long-Term Goals lures you out of the present reality and into a world of potential. Luckily, these imaginative excursions can have a lasting impact on what comes next in your life. Instead of losing yourself in fantasyland, consciously paint your future with the colors of your mind."
pisces,2011-12-22,"You may be feeling very sure of yourself now, believing that you have the ability to improve your career path simply through the power of positive thought. Unfortunately, your visions might be slightly warped, enabling you to view your future through rose-colored glasses. Although there's no reason to assume the worst, don't avoid difficult facts just because you're able to see so much good wherever you look. A reality check only improves your chances for success."
aries,2011-12-23,"You may believe that your fantasies can become real today if you are willing to take a risk and tell others exactly what you want. But the Moon's square to your key planet Mars can put so much energy into your words that you frighten someone with your intensity rather than demonstrating your trustworthiness. Thankfully, a less aggressive approach allows you to be more convincing. Be sure you understand your audience before you take things too fast."
taurus,2011-12-23,"The Moon's anxious aspect with your ruling planet Venus combines your need for adventure with your desire to be popular. You may seek pleasure from new and different activities, but you must be careful not to avoid your responsibilities in the pursuit of social gratification. Entertaining your options doesn't mean that you need to act on every whim. You can find ways to have a good time while still keeping your feet on the ground."
gemini,2011-12-23,"A friend or co-worker may reveal a grandiose scheme to you today, yet you are fearful of getting caught up in a whirlwind of activity that spins your day out of control. There's no harm in relaxing the reins a bit, but don't let anyone take them away from you. Although you might enjoy yourself for a while if you didn't have to do things your way, you'll be happier now following your own agenda instead of someone else's."
cancer,2011-12-23,"Someone may be very persistent today, making it difficult for you to say no. But it's wise to take a deep breath and give yourself a little time to consider what you want before agreeing to anything. Don't just say yes because you want others to like you. It's healthier to go through the awkward process of establishing clear boundaries now than taking the easy way out. Ultimately, following your own dreams makes you happier than setting them aside to please anyone else."
leo,2011-12-23,"Others want to know your secret because you usually seem cheerful and confident about what you are doing. Thankfully, you are blessed because you can have a lot of fun while fulfilling your daily obligations. But you can't divulge your method because you don't have a hidden formula. Just do what you do best; continue to be honest while living your life as transparently as you can. The simplest things can bring you joy now, even if the current challenges you face demand your attention."
virgo,2011-12-23,"You would be wise to take a small idea and build on it today, but be careful about inflating your expectations too much. It's better now to achieve a modest success that makes you feel good about your accomplishments, rather than reaching too high and then facing the disappointment of failure. Fortunately, whatever you choose to do now is not set in stone; you will have opportunities to modify your goals as you move along."
libra,2011-12-23,"You may actually think that today is your lucky day -- and a special fantasy just might come true. Don't be afraid to trust your intuition; however, it's not so smart to assume that you'll receive exactly what you want. Your natural flexibility is the key to landing a delicious surprise that far exceeds your expectations. But stubbornly sticking to your previous agenda could cause you to miss the magic right in front of you."
scorpio,2011-12-23,"Your unwavering belief in yourself makes a big difference today, for your thoughts create the blueprint of your future. The outgoing Sagittarius Moon squares your key planet Mars in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, coercing you to swing into action now and go for exactly what you want. But you won't make much progress by taking baby steps, so boldly act on your most positive thoughts to make the best impression."
sagittarius,2011-12-23,"You may feel anxious today, but it's not because anything specific is going wrong. To the contrary, you're worried that you're missing something important in your positive assessment of what's going on around you. But don't let your concerns trick you into taking impulsive action. Methodically complete as much unfinished business as you can in preparation for the brand new cycle that begins after tomorrow's New Moon."
capricorn,2011-12-23,"You may be concerned that someone's holding out on you today by undermining your positive efforts. Unfortunately, you might not be able to find any tangible evidence to support your current worries. Paradoxically, the opposite might be true; something you choose to keep to yourself can turn a relationship inside out. Consider what you're afraid to reveal and then think about how to shine the light of awareness on your secret. Bringing your truth out into the open may be enough to dissolve the gulf between you and others."
aquarius,2011-12-23,"The Moon's visit to your 11th House of Social Networking helps lead you and your friends into the future. Don't hold back; even if your dreams seem unrealistic, your unrestrained imagination helps you to visualize what's ahead. Instead of allowing practical considerations to slow you down today, share your visions as they appear to you. You can always refine your plans later on to make them more concrete."
pisces,2011-12-23,"It's not easy to separate your identity from what you do in the real world now that the Moon is moving through your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Whether you're thinking about your profession, your role in the community or your place within your family, it's important to understand where you stand so you can reconsider where you are going. Don't rush blindly ahead; instead create a new agenda and make a manageable plan to reach your goals."
aries,2011-12-24,Bossing people around isn't the most effective way to demonstrate your authority. Being a successful leader comes from power that you earn when you are in harmony with the truth. All you need to do now is take responsibility for your own actions. Pay careful attention to what you say and how you say it because you are more forceful than you realize. You can have the impact you desire today if you take a gentler approach.
taurus,2011-12-24,"You might think that you know how your day will unfold, however, an unexpected event may require you to modify your plans. But don't just change everything all at once; overreacting will only make things worse. Minor adjustments that are well aimed are more useful, even if you don't see immediate results from your actions. Nevertheless, you still should be able to reach your goals if you step back and broaden your perspective."
gemini,2011-12-24,You may experience self-doubt today if your day deviates from your ideal schedule. You might even wonder if all your efforts over these last few weeks have moved you closer to your goals or have been an exercise in futility. Your key word now is patience; don't do anything recklessly just because you're frustrated with the apparent lack of progress. You'll begin to feel more productive as you start to see results from your recent hard work.
cancer,2011-12-24,"You are very sensitive to the reserved Capricorn New Moon because it lands in your 7th House of Partnerships. You may be feeling stressed out by a relationship with a friend or lover, especially if you each have different ways of approaching conflict. Thankfully, persistence is rewarded now, and your willingness to face a difficult issue could actually bring the two of you closer together. Even if interactions seem strained today, sticking with the process can result in feelings of accomplishment."
leo,2011-12-24,"Your usual weekend routine may be turned inside out today as the New Moon activates your 6th House of Habits. You don't like the idea of doing things differently now, so a change of pace might be upsetting at first. However, shaking up old traditions can reveal details that alter your perspective on the holiday season. Don't waste too much time looking back; it's useless to judge your past harshly. Instead, look ahead and change the way you respond in the present moment."
virgo,2011-12-24,"Today's calculating Capricorn New Moon occurs in your 5th House of Self-Expression. If you have been waiting for the best time to share something dear to your heart with someone special, this is your moment. Finally, after much careful deliberation you're ready to show your cards. Remember, keeping secrets now prevents you from having a shot at success, so be honest and give yourself the chance you deserve."
libra,2011-12-24,"It may appear as if your personal life isn't going exactly as you had hoped today, but you'll eventually get what you want with the ambitious Capricorn New Moon visiting your 4th House of Foundations. However, satisfaction could still take a while because now you are building a solid base for future operations. Keep in mind anything that is truly meaningful is probably well worth the wait."
scorpio,2011-12-24,"Today's stabilizing Capricorn New Moon activates your 3rd House of Communication, encouraging you to establish a reliable framework for interactions with close friends and family. It may be time to put difficult conversations on the table, especially if your relationships have been strained by uncomfortable discussions that you have been avoiding. However, don't push for closure now; allowing the intensity to soften will help you reach a more palatable resolution."
sagittarius,2011-12-24,"If your path has recently been blocked by obstacles, the resistance is finally beginning to dissipate. It may appear as if your luck is improving, but it's probably the result of all the hard work you've been doing over the past couple of months. Thankfully, now you should be able to enjoy the fruits of your labor. But don't expect too much too fast as you continue to build on your accomplishments."
capricorn,2011-12-24,"Today's pragmatic Capricorn New Moon might lead you to believe that you're in charge, but events of the day suggest otherwise. You may have recently given up significant control over your life, but it only gets crazier if you think that you can put everything back in order now. Don't waste time getting excited about what's ahead or being sad for what you've left behind. Instead, maintain a positive attitude in the present moment where your thoughts are busy creating your future."
aquarius,2011-12-24,"The conservative Capricorn New Moon's visit to your 12th House of Karma could stir up issues from your past. Unfortunately, you might not recollect events as they really occurred since your imagination is bending the truth out of shape. Everything may seem overly important now, as if this present moment is more significant than all others. It's healthier to take the current truth with a grain of salt, for your perspective will return to normal in the days ahead."
pisces,2011-12-24,"Your world may seem a bit surreal now because you're able to see further into your future as the Capricorn New Moon stirs your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams. Fortunately, you can use your imagination to create the next phase of your life. Although you might be tempted to lose yourself to fantasies, you can improve your chances for success by being practical while developing your vision of tomorrow."
aries,2011-12-25,"You might want to show others how much you care about them today, yet you're also driven to be practical. Thankfully, you won't have to sacrifice your connection with reality in order to get your heartfelt message across. Trust your emotions, even if you have trouble putting them into words. Your actions will clearly demonstrate your feelings because the Moon's fluid trine with ardent Mars allows you to be convincing without overstating your case."
taurus,2011-12-25,"It's difficult for anyone to get you to admit that you're wrong today as opinionated Jupiter turns direct in your stubborn sign. Fortunately, your logic is probably sound, enabling you to stand your ground without sounding irrational. However, even the best defense cannot make up for starting with an incorrect assumption. Although you have the power of positive thought on your side now, you'll feel better about yourself if you're willing to listen to reasonable feedback and alter your perspective if warranted."
gemini,2011-12-25,"It may be challenging to initiate action on your own today, so graciously accept any offers of help that you might receive. Thankfully, your friends and family are likely to stimulate your thinking with their innovative ideas as Mercury moves through your 7th House of Companions. But caution is advised because you're inclined to make big promises without considering how you're going to meet your obligations. Think about what it will take to live up to your words before saying something you will soon regret."
cancer,2011-12-25,"Your interactions with loved ones are quite significant today with the ambitious Capricorn Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others. Although your main focus might be aimed at demonstrating how much you care, your sense of duty could motivate you to go overboard with your concern. Naturally, it's healthy to express your love, but only if you do it freely without expecting any recognition or approval in return."
leo,2011-12-25,"You might feel like a workhorse today, even if your efforts are directed toward fun and frivolity. You may have put yourself in a situation where others are depending on you to create a celebratory atmosphere, but you could diminish the joy if you've taken on too much. Instead of trying to do everything on your own, ask for help before your frustration gets the best of you. Sharing in the responsibilities brings everyone closer together."
virgo,2011-12-25,"You may inadvertently mislead someone by sending signals that only show your serious side. Although you want to join in the fun, everyone assumes that you will be the one working extra hard to get everything just right. They might not realize that today is different and you're eager to play without being so picky. Take the time to clearly communicate your lighthearted desires or you could miss out on a wonderful time."
libra,2011-12-25,"You're ready to put in the extra effort at home today to make sure that everyone has a memorable time. Luckily, your energy level is high and you won't exhaust yourself going the extra mile. Others may be effusive with their recognition or praise, but not necessarily with their assistance. You must be self-motivated now; don't expect anyone else to jump in to help until you're already moving in the right direction."
scorpio,2011-12-25,"You may be looking to kick up your heels today because you're tired of being the serious one in the group. Although you aren't interested in maintaining the status quo, your emotions remain quite grounded. You just want to break out of a rut without necessarily turning your life upside down. Luckily, it's easier than you realize; just announce your intentions, release your attachment to the past and embrace a more joyful approach."
sagittarius,2011-12-25,"Your core values have a strong influence over the choices you make today. Although you can appear easygoing, you're more serious than usual. You may think that it's wiser to keep quiet about your real concerns because you don't want to draw others into your contemplative mood. However, you might be surprised at how eager your loved ones are to shift the conversation toward spiritual topics instead of just filling up the silence with words. Start the ball rolling and see where it leads."
capricorn,2011-12-25,"You might feel as if everything is rushing by too fast, yet all you want to do is withdraw from the hectic pace. Thankfully, you can find solace in simple pleasures now, even if more exciting opportunities are offered. Participating in a traditional holiday ritual or even making time for a spiritual retreat is more in keeping with your current state of mind. You don't need to get caught up in noisy celebrations or mindless distractions just because that's what expected. Be courageous and do what makes your heart happy."
aquarius,2011-12-25,"You have the knack to inspire others today with your eagerness to engage in social activities, combined with a sensible approach to spirituality. Although you're charming now as you talk up a storm, your energy is more contained than others realize. Taking part in family fun or a holiday celebration can be fulfilling as long as you also make time for self-reflection. Don't be afraid to say no to an invitation in order to make time for deeper contemplation and spiritual exploration."
pisces,2011-12-25,"It may seem as if some of the traditional seasonal celebrations have lost a bit of their luster this year. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to withdraw from social events and play the role of a recluse. Just make sure that you know what you're getting yourself into when you do join in the festivities. Instead of being pulled too far off track by other people's ideas, advanced planning helps you meet your commitments while allowing time for spiritual pursuits, too."
aries,2011-12-26,"You think that being more practical is a good idea today, but eventually you're likely to give up and follow your dreams. It isn't that you're incapable of acting sensibly; it's just your radical side comes out when the Moon enters unconventional Aquarius. Be careful; it's not a smart time to burn bridges by alienating those who support you. Instead, find ways to speak your truth without starting a fight."
taurus,2011-12-26,"You may feel out of the loop today if others don't notice your contribution. Thankfully, you're patient enough to wait for the recognition you deserve, even if you do grow a bit frustrated in the process. However, losing your temper might be the best thing you can do now because it helps to clear the air. If you keep your annoyance to yourself, the tension could continue to grow. Just remember to express your feelings without blaming anyone else."
gemini,2011-12-26,"You're quite focused on getting your chores done today, but you might have too much to do. You could reach a breaking point when you're tempted to throw up your hands and walk away from your responsibilities. However, you won't be able to escape from your commitments that easily. Instead of avoiding reality, demonstrate your persistence by sticking with your agenda. Checking a few things off your list is a good start toward alleviating the stress."
cancer,2011-12-26,"You are less likely to behave nicely just to get others to like you today. You are clear about your needs and are willing to take responsibility to achieve satisfaction. You typically might not be this assertive, but it feels natural now. Even if you're confident that you'll reach your goals, don't be disrespectful of your friends and colleagues. Let the day unfold and wait until later to make the appropriate changes if things aren't going your way."
leo,2011-12-26,"You're taking your work very seriously today and are committed to delivering on your promises. If repetitive tasks are on your plate, you're ready to concentrate on them until they are done. But you're as equally enthusiastic to jump into something totally new. Either way, it's tempting to push the energy too far. A bit of sensible self-restraint is useful to maximize your progress no matter what projects are in front of you."
virgo,2011-12-26,"In an ideal world, you might want to schedule your day backwards by having fun first and then doing your chores later. It may be frustrating if you try to narrow your focus in the morning while the Moon is still visiting your 5th House of Fun and Games. But when she enters your 6th House of Employment this afternoon, you won't likely be so eager to partake in any distracting activities. Grab the opportunity for enjoyment while you can and start your day with some playtime before heading off to work."
libra,2011-12-26,"Personal or professional obligations may hold your attention during the morning, but later on you're eager to shift gears so you can enjoy yourself. Scheming about your escape can be more fun than you expect, especially if you attack it as if it were a competitive game. Don't rush ahead impulsively; wait until you feel the time is right before doing your disappearing act and following the plan you devised earlier in the day."
scorpio,2011-12-26,"You might sense an unpleasant wave of energy way out on the horizon of your awareness, making it difficult to enjoy the day. Although intense emotions continue to build throughout the day, it's not wise to push them away. Avoiding uncomfortable feelings isn't smart because they'll just gain strength if you do. Instead, express what's in your heart, even if it isn't what others want to hear. It's healthier for them to learn your truth now than receive a watered-down version of it at some later time."
sagittarius,2011-12-26,"Although you may have to head back to work today or do chores that have piled up in your absence, the day should end on a positive note. Ironically, establishing sensible limits actually grants you additional freedom now. But, if you're not attentive to setting healthy boundaries, you might have to take a defensive posture. Don't delay the inevitable, even if it feels uncomfortable; clearly draw your line in the sand and prepare to hold your ground if you must."
capricorn,2011-12-26,"The beginning of your day should go along smoothly enough, but someone may ask you to explain your values later. You could be resistant to talking about your beliefs because you're still developing your position. It doesn't feel right to climb out on a limb in order to defend an opinion that's still unformed. Although you may have a good reason to stay quiet, your silence can be misinterpreted. Hiding is not the best strategy now, for it encourages others to misread your intentions."
aquarius,2011-12-26,"The mood-setting Moon's shift into your intellectual sign today is a reminder that your emotions are more important than you think. However, there's nothing you need to change at this time. Just be thankful that you have an opportunity to experience your life to the fullest, even if you must engage in a passionate debate to defend your position. Sometimes your feelings can be quite confusing, but now you have something useful to learn from them."
pisces,2011-12-26,"You may be feeling stress that arises from your unrealistic desire to avoid your current responsibilities. Although you might dream of escaping to an exotic place, you could become upset when you realize that it's impossible to take time off now. Don't ignore your frustration or it can turn into anger and erupt again in a few days. Instead, find a way to slip away for a while, even if it's only with an intriguing movie or a good book."
aries,2011-12-27,"Although you might bump into resistance when sharing your plan today, your thoughts could be so intense that you end up revealing more than is necessary. It's not that your ideas are too controversial to talk about; it's just that you would be better off taking more time to develop them before involving others. Fortunately, waiting until you're ready will improve the chances of getting others to support your plan."
taurus,2011-12-27,"Your good intentions should carry you far today, but reaching for the stars isn't enough to ensure that you'll get there. You are eager to meet your obligations, but things could get complicated if you ignore important details. Don't just push your way forward without a sound plan; paying careful attention to how all the little pieces fit together enables you to accomplish more than you expect."
gemini,2011-12-27,"Your enthusiasm can fuel a conversation today, enabling it to go off in many exciting directions. You are eager to participate in dialogues that explore the possibilities before you, but it will take more than dynamic interactions to make the best ideas take shape. In fact, too much talking might be a tricky way to avoid the reality of how much work you must do. Don't let your overactive mind hijack your day; manage your obligations so you have time for physical activities, too."
cancer,2011-12-27,"You aren't sure of how much you need to divulge today because you don't want to scare off your best allies. Although your story could be compelling, it may be too intense for some of your colleagues to handle. Don't just make a one-size-fits-all announcement; instead interact with each person on a one-to-one basis. It's more sensible not to say any more than what is necessary. Be cautious and save the full disclosure for when you're sure that the time is right."
leo,2011-12-27,"Someone can teach you something very important now, yet it's challenging to let the message come through if you believe you already have the answers you need. You could miss an opportunity to make a breakthrough in a relationship if you're unwilling to be vulnerable. Fortunately, today's lesson will likely be gift-wrapped and sugar coated because the Moon joins sweet Venus in your 7th House of Others. If you become aware of your own resistance, consciously soften your stance when engaged in a conversation."
virgo,2011-12-27,"Your ruling planet Mercury is in the spotlight today, prompting opinionated interactions with colleagues. A relationship that has been limited to the workplace may cross over the line and begin to transform into a real friendship. Don't put up artificial barriers; just allow the conversation to flow naturally and deal with any emotional issues as they arise."
libra,2011-12-27,"It's not easy to express yourself spontaneously today, especially if your role at work requires you to keep your personal feelings to yourself. Fortunately, you may discover that you can share your inner process with an acquaintance, but you need to be selective or you'll end up wishing that you didn't say anything at all. Don't expect too much at first or you'll be discouraged. If you are committed to sharing what's in your heart, things should get better once your workday is done."
scorpio,2011-12-27,"You may be feeling very private today about your future plans, so it's wise to keep thinking about what you want to do before sharing your thoughts with anyone else. It isn't that you're afraid of what someone might say; it's just that you still need time to contemplate until you know how you truly feel. Don't allow others to talk you into disclosing anything before you're ready."
sagittarius,2011-12-27,"You may be too eager to adjust your schedule if something comes up that seems important. However, canceling an existing appointment at the last minute could create problems, rather than solve them. It's not wise to act impulsively if your decision involves others. Before you decide on a new course of action, consider the impact your behavior will have on everyone else. If it still seems urgent, go ahead with the necessary changes."
capricorn,2011-12-27,"You may be unclear about your current financial picture, which could lead you to make a bad decision today. You might have made a mistake while calculating an account balance or, perhaps, underestimated the cost of a large purchase. Confront the issue promptly by getting all your facts straight first. It doesn't matter if a money problem is big or small; it will be more difficult to handle if you don't take care of it now."
aquarius,2011-12-27,"You may have an exciting vision that you want to share with your co-workers or friends today. You assume they will hear you out and support you as you strive to fulfill your dreams. However, it's important to realize that your current disclosure needs to be an all-or-nothing one; you won't be able to get away with sharing only part of your idea. There's no room for secrets now, so make sure you have all the data necessary to tell your whole story."
pisces,2011-12-27,"Your enthusiasm about your career can be quite contagious today, but you could alienate others if you get too carried away by all the possibilities. Thankfully, your clear communication is able to bring out the best in others now. However, there's a fine line between the power of positive thought and the danger of blind optimism. Tempering your rosy outlook with realism should be enough to prevent problems in the next few days."
aries,2011-12-28,"It might seem as if you keep saying the wrong things today, even if your intentions are pure. You might try so hard that you lose your rhythm, yet you may not be aware that you're out of step. Instead of spending too much time clarifying what you meant, rely on your actions, rather than your words, to get your message across. You can always revisit the issue tomorrow and explain yourself when you're back in sync."
taurus,2011-12-28,"Your notion that everything will go your way at work is not just a wish, since your assumptions are based on facts and your conclusions are the result of sound thinking. Nevertheless, you can still dream up a perfect fantasy based on how you want things to unfold, so pay careful attention to how you embellish the truth. Luckily, you needn't mislead anyone if you can catch yourself in the process before it's too late."
gemini,2011-12-28,"Your ruling planet Mercury runs into an anxious alignment with exaggerating Jupiter, provoking you to stretch the truth. You might even believe that you're clever enough to get away with bending the facts. But you'll still have to deal with the consequences of what you say if others see through your story. Ultimately, you would be wiser to present your position as methodically as possible, without trying to step around any annoying facts. Being clear about your intentions right from the start prevents problems in the future."
cancer,2011-12-28,"Although your super-sensitivity can occasionally get the best of you, it's possible to adjust your attitude as needed instead of blindly sticking to a rigid agenda. It helps to check in with your friends and co-workers to learn what they think before jumping to any premature conclusions. Once you incorporate valid feedback into your strategy, you'll be better equipped to go ahead with your plans for the day."
leo,2011-12-28,"You are aware of the hard work ahead, but you're not all that eager to jump in yet. Part of the problem is that you don't have a manageable plan because it feels as if the current situation isn't very stable. It's not necessary to make long-term decisions now; instead, focus on the immediate activities and do anything you can to positively impact the present circumstances."
virgo,2011-12-28,"Your confidence returns today as your key planet Mercury aligns with optimistic Jupiter. Nevertheless, you're still acting cautiously because you don't want to be disappointed later on. You have faith in your analytical capabilities, but you may not know how to balance a realistic outlook with unrealistic dreams. Don't look to others for cues; instead, pay attention to your thoughts and avoid overreacting in either direction."
libra,2011-12-28,"You like the idea of demonstrating the power of positive thinking, but you could take your enthusiasm to an extreme. Unfortunately, you could set yourself up for discouragement today if you try to reach too far. Letting go of unattainable goals is your first step toward restoring balance. Establishing a line between humility and self-confidence can be tricky business. Re-evaluating your strengths and weaknesses helps you be more realistic about manifesting your dreams."
scorpio,2011-12-28,"You're not overly thrilled with your plans for the future, but you're capable of balancing your fantasies with the reality of your current situation. Even if you're tempted to escape into your own illusions, you don't have to lose track of where you're standing now and where you want to go. Ironically, staying connected with the bigger picture will ultimately make navigation in the present moment easier to handle."
sagittarius,2011-12-28,"You are being lured into a dreamy world of illusions today, but the strength of your convictions is strong enough to keep you grounded. You may suddenly realize that you don't have as many answers as you once thought you had, but this epiphany can work to your benefit. Don't let go of your core beliefs; instead, use them as a moral compass to help you to find your way through these confusing times."
capricorn,2011-12-28,"This season is a time of renewal for you, symbolized by the return of the Sun's light. There's no need to fear that setting your goals too high will set you up for failure, because you have to be challenged in order to shine your brightest. Nevertheless, your judgment might not be as infallible now as it usually is, so make sure you're heading in the right direction before you go too far."
aquarius,2011-12-28,"You could get caught up in a complex web of emotions today that feels more urgent than it actually is. Unfortunately, it may be impossible to walk away from the intensity and difficult to de-emphasize it. Thankfully, there is a simple solution; just avoid making significant decisions at this time. The drama will subside in a couple of days, allowing everything to resume its normal place in your life. Wait and see how you feel before making any major moves."
pisces,2011-12-28,"Your long-term goals may be totally unrealistic now, making it exceptionally difficult to turn your strategy into a concrete plan. You're able to be hold on to your dreams as long as you don't commit to a single path. But once you start focusing on what to do next, you're confronted by the impracticality of your desires. Rather than losing yourself in an illusory world, use some common sense along the way. Paying attention to reality prevents an unexpected crash landing later on."
aries,2011-12-29,"It's difficult to relax now because you're likely to push up against deep resistance to change. Although you're quick to blame others for your frustration, it originates within you. You might bury your head in the sand and pretend that you cannot understand what's happening, but denial won't solve anything. Instead, confront your fears so you can get to the source of your own psychological melodrama. Awareness is the first step in making positive change."
taurus,2011-12-29,"Your fantasies may take you for an intense trip through your fears today, yet you could come out the other side with a much more positive perspective. Still, this isn't a light and easy journey, because there aren't any guarantees that your current transformation will succeed. However, it's not important to overcome all the negativity at once. Take time to assess your strengths and weaknesses so you can prepare for the future with a realistic outlook."
gemini,2011-12-29,"You're more eager than usual to explore what's beneath the surface in your attempt to understand your feelings now. The most meaningful emotional treasures are hidden deep under the veneer of social etiquette. However, you may become so fixated on the potential rewards that you push too hard. Unfortunately, your obsessive behavior today could upset a relationship. Take time to moderate your need for change with sufficient patience to allow the current situation to transform at a natural pace."
cancer,2011-12-29,"You may feel as if you're giving birth to a whole new way of relating to others now, but this change comes with its own share of stress. In order to reinvent yourself you must confront someone's control issues, especially if you are growing in ways that appear to threaten the status quo. On the other hand, you might be the one who is stuck, and you don't appreciate anyone meddling in your affairs. However, there's no need to hold on to the past now; it's slipping away from you whether you like it or not."
leo,2011-12-29,"You're ready to go ahead with your plans now, even if you're receiving mixed signals from everyone else involved. However, it isn't a good strategy to push your agenda onto anyone else. Instead of progressing toward your goals, you could inadvertently agitate unnecessary emotional conflict. Just keep in mind that you may need to proceed on your own if your friends and acquaintances don't understand your current passion."
virgo,2011-12-29,"You're so concerned with making everything perfect now that you tend to plan more than is necessary. Unfortunately, placing too much attention on the details can spoil the fun by taking the spontaneity out of the day. Avoid getting swept into an unnecessary power struggle just because you believe that your way is the only way. Lessen the pressure on the current circumstances by consciously choosing acceptance over fear."
libra,2011-12-29,"Someone's unspoken feelings can mess things up today, even if it seems safer in order to avoid conflict. Unfortunately, the hidden cost of peace may be higher than you realize since jealousy or possessiveness can stir anger and resentment. The potentially negative energy is tricky to control because sharing can be as problematic as keeping everything to yourself. It's healthy to talk about what's happening, but don't get so intense that you push others away."
scorpio,2011-12-29,"You may be feeling overwhelmed with how many things you have to do now, but your intensity level is high and you're committed to do whatever it takes to cross some tasks off your list. Unfortunately, you might disagree with someone who has a different idea of how you should spend your day. Actually, a willful Sun-Pluto conjunction can turn every interaction into a major drama today. Processing your emotions before you react enables you to control the flow of events."
sagittarius,2011-12-29,"You are determined to get what you want today, but it's wise to recognize that acting in harmony with your core values is more important than material satisfaction. You might reconsider a recent decision and want to modify your course of action, but this can be complicated if you're already in motion. There's no need to panic, so allow sufficient time to alter your plans. Keep in mind that you didn't get to this point overnight, and you won't be able to change direction in a moment's notice."
capricorn,2011-12-29,"You are susceptible to the emotional intensity of today's Sun-Pluto hook-up because it occurs in your sign. Even the most minor issues can be quickly blown out of proportion as tempers flare and passions erupt. You might become obsessed about having your way now, and you're not willing to take no for an answer. Unfortunately, you could invite stronger resistance if you are too assertive. Being gentle and persistent is more effective than forcing your point of view on anyone else."
aquarius,2011-12-29,"You might think that you'll accomplish more today by sticking to your schedule, but it's very important to remain flexible with your time. Your enthusiasm may be dampened if unforeseen events in the morning require you to abandon your previous plans. Making commitments in advance is a smart strategy as long as you know when to let go of control. Don't struggle trying to hold your agenda together; instead, let it fall apart so you can put the pieces back together tomorrow."
pisces,2011-12-29,"Your dreams about the future are quite intense now, bringing excitement one minute and worry the next. You're beginning to realize that your plans are not unfolding as expected. But rather than feeling discouraged or defeated, try to see this as an opportunity to reinvent yourself according to your vision and not someone else's. Let go of past goals that are no longer meaningful. Instead, get ready to step into the year ahead by setting new priorities for your life."
aries,2011-12-30,"You probably have a clear set of objectives and understand why it's important to tie up loose ends today. However, your mind is on everything except work because you're eager for the weekend to begin. The Moon's presence in your 12th House of Escapism opposes action-hero Mars in your 6th House of Employment, enticing you to find ways to avoid doing much of anything. Unfortunately, you'll pay the price for procrastinating, so bite the bullet and get your chores done before it's too late."
taurus,2011-12-30,"You are in a creative mood today, but you might not have time for artistic pursuits. Responsibilities at work have piled up or there are chores yet to finish at home. Nevertheless, a bit of concentrated effort can go a long way now if you don't allow yourself to be distracted by everything interesting thing that comes to your attention. Narrow your focus so you have time to explore playful self-expression later in the day."
gemini,2011-12-30,"You may be uncertain about what you need to do in order to live up to other people's expectations. For example, your boss might give you unclear directions and then be unavailable to answer your questions. Or, you might have previous obligations that distract you from a current assignment. In any case, accepting the impossibility of pleasing everyone frees you to simply do the best you can and then let go until the confusion clears."
cancer,2011-12-30,"Your head is filled with such big ideas now that it's unrealistic to make any of them come true. Even if you create a prioritized list of things to do, your wandering mind scatters your thoughts and actions. Instead of biting off more that you can chew, use the day to review the previous year and think about the next one. Don't judge yourself harshly if you aren't very productive today. Some days are just meant for dreaming."
leo,2011-12-30,"You want to stretch your boundaries today by talking about your feelings with someone special. However, your words may seem vague, even if you have very specific things you want to say. Ironically, using fewer words helps you to be more concise in your thinking. Save the long rambling conversations for another day; instead, let your actions speak for you."
virgo,2011-12-30,"You may be stressed out by someone close to you because you cannot figure out what he or she wants. Even if you're asked for something very specific, you could be confused when you deliver the goods only to have your partner or friend tell you that you got it wrong. You might begin to think that you're in a no-win situation, but your frustration is temporary. Thankfully, you're able to change the dynamics when you stop trying so hard and just treat your loved ones with kindness."
libra,2011-12-30,"You have high hopes for improving your daily health regimen now and may try to put your goals into the form of resolutions for the New Year. However, the dreamy Pisces Moon in your 6th House of Details makes it hard to put your desires into an executable plan. Instead of writing a list of vague generalities based upon unrealistic goals, be specific as possible. It's better to have two or three concrete items than lots of good ideas that remain unrealized."
scorpio,2011-12-30,"Although you might talk about how you're going to increase your income or change your spending habits, your actions today don't necessarily support your goals. You may be tempted to spend money on something for the sheer enjoyment of it. Unfortunately, you could become self-critical very quickly, preventing you from having the pleasurable experience you expected. Cut yourself some slack so you can have a little well-earned fun."
sagittarius,2011-12-30,"Although you continue to apply yourself toward specific professional goals, you might choose to leave work early today. You're tempted to retreat into the hidden recesses of your own mind and leave some responsibilities unfulfilled. Instead of participating in social activities later on, consider staying home and escaping by watching a movie, playing video games or reading a book."
capricorn,2011-12-30,"This can be a good planning day as long as you remember to pay attention to the details. You're tempted to dream big, while still understanding the need to maintain a practical outlook on your future. Even if you are thinking about taking a vacation to an exotic location, you're able to keep yourself on track and within your budget. Research your options, take good notes, and don't be afraid to do something you have never done before."
aquarius,2011-12-30,"Your friends and associates can be a source of good times today, but participating in social activities might end up costing you more than expected. It's not that you're stingy; it's just than you would prefer to know in advance how much something will cost. Although you may want to blame others for misleading you, your eagerness to be involved might have inhibited you from asking too many questions up front. Let go of any resentment; for now, just enjoy yourself while you can."
pisces,2011-12-30,"It seems as if others are picking on you today for no reason at all. But the hypersensitive Pisces Moon is opposite Mars in critical Virgo, suggesting that you are more vulnerable now than usual. Don't assume that everyone is on your case just because you're feeling insecure. You could miss out on some very good advice if you're afraid of hearing the truth."
aries,2011-12-31,"You are eager to rush into a new situation without a lot of forethought when the Moon returns to your impetuous sign this morning. Unfortunately, your impulsive behavior may arouse a strong reaction from a friend or acquaintance. It's wise to wait until tomorrow to see how you feel rather than starting something now you could quickly regret. If your idea still seems like a smart one, then it makes sense to proceed full steam ahead."
taurus,2011-12-31,"You are easily annoyed by your own impatience because you're uncertain if starting a new project now is such a good idea. You might even try to talk yourself out of doing anything today, but this behavior could add to your frustration. Ultimately, you know that it's wiser to listen to logic and tie up loose ends before doing anything else. However, if you blindly push ahead you're likely to run into strong resistance."
gemini,2011-12-31,"Finally, you're ready to look ahead instead of reviewing your recent past. Nevertheless, there are formidable obstacles that must be overcome before you're able to put your new plans into action. Attempts to avoid the source of the current friction are futile. Denial only strengthens the resistance, for the problem will resurface later with greater intensity. Slow down and face the music. You'll be more prepared to step into your future once you learn a valuable lesson."
cancer,2011-12-31,"Relationship issues may be stressful now, creating conflict with the demands of your work. You might feel as if you're caught in the crosscurrents and that you will let someone down, no matter which path you choose. However, there is another way through this obstacle course. Balancing your professional and personal lives isn't easy, but setting up a situation that avoids creating winners and losers is your best bet."
leo,2011-12-31,"Your confidence soars today, especially if you are excited about the future. Unfortunately, your plans are complicated by unstable circumstances and people who may not support your needs now. Don't place too much value on getting assistance from anyone else. Nevertheless, openly accept help when it's offered, even if you believe that you can do it alone. Learning to receive from others might not be comfortable at first, but revealing your vulnerability can deepen an important relationship."
virgo,2011-12-31,"All of your relationships could seem complicated these days and you might choose to avoid interpersonal entanglements as much as you can. Sharing your feelings may not sound safe now, but the emotional roller coaster should start to smooth out in the next day or so. Meanwhile, you may be more dependent on others than you are willing to admit. Acknowledge your desires without making anyone else responsible for your satisfaction. Your radical honesty could defuse a tricky situation."
libra,2011-12-31,"It's annoying if someone makes a promise and then doesn't follow through by delivering the goods. It's not as if you coerced anyone into doing something for you; chances are others just arrive out of the blue and offer to help. Nevertheless, it's never a good idea to become overly dependent on anyone else. Even if you are left in the lurch, just get on with your original plans without wasting time playing the blame game."
scorpio,2011-12-31,"You want to demonstrate your competence and your loyalty by shining at what you do today. However, you may not be able to get rid of a bad feeling that you're being judged by someone who doesn't really appreciate your efforts. You are now being challenged to overcome resistance: yours or someone else's. Either way, sidestepping the real issues can feel like defeat. Fortunately, you'll be proud of yourself if you stand your ground and just do the best you can."
sagittarius,2011-12-31,"Today starts off with a bang and the energy builds right through your evening celebrations. Although you can feel a burst of creativity early on, you might get irritated with someone who tries to hijack your day with their agenda. But you're not interested in playing it safe and avoiding confrontation; it could feel exhilarating to push back and defend your territory. Just remember, there may be a price to pay for alienating an ally. Practicing the art of compromise now isn't easy, but should have a positive effect."
capricorn,2011-12-31,"You may be struggling to balance your naturally conservative approach with an urgent desire to throw caution to the wind. If you have been invited to a party that's outside your normal social group, you might look forward to your chance to have a different kind of experience. On the other hand, you don't want to abandon your friends. Ultimately, your choice may not be as significant as you think it will be, as long as you take responsibility for whatever you decide."
aquarius,2011-12-31,"You may try to make it through the day without causing too much trouble, but once you get going you could raise a few eyebrows. You want to experience life to the fullest now, and could pack so much into each moment that others grow tired just listening to your plans. Remember, you're riding an adrenaline high today, so be cautious. Even you might not be able to keep up with your crazy schedule."
pisces,2011-12-31,"Even if you're encountering persistent resistance from your friends, continue pushing toward your goals. You may have your own idea about how you want to welcome in the New Year, but others may pressure you to change your mind. Unfortunately, there will be no winners in a power struggle today. Ultimately, fulfilling your fantasies now might not be as important as you think. As long as your intentions are pure, you should be able to balance your individual needs with the desires of those closest to you."
