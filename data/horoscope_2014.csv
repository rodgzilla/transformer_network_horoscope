aries,2014-01-01,"Unexpected developments lead to a whole new set of possibilities as today's Capricorn New Moon activates your 10th House of Status. You're eager to take on a big challenge this year, partly because you could underestimate the amount of work that will be required to complete a project. However, if you can keep your fantasies from distorting the facts, you have an excellent chance to make your dreams come true. Reach outside the box, but don't leave your common sense behind."
taurus,2014-01-01,"Your need for adventure might become obsessive now as the Capricorn New Moon joins relentless Pluto in your 9th House of Big Ideas. No matter how much you try to relax, your current sense of urgency won't likely disappear. Instead of trying to deny your wanderlust, consider ways to satisfy your needs without turning your life upside down. For example, instead of distracting yourself with unobtainable visions of exotic travel, think about enrolling in a course of study to expand your mind."
gemini,2014-01-01,"You are quite serious today and may have a perfect opportunity to demonstrate your sound logic and emotional depth. But stay away from discussions about risky financial investments while the practical Capricorn New Moon triggers your 8th House of Shared Resources. Schemes that promise you a fast fortune should be avoided at all costs. Taking a carefully calculated risk can bring rewards beyond your wildest expectations, but you still need to work hard to receive the payoff."
cancer,2014-01-01,"A relationship that usually seems safe may test your limits today as you struggle to redefine your boundaries. The Capricorn New Moon joins passionate Pluto in your 7th House of Relationships, possibly attracting an intense person into your life. However, this individual could reflect a portion of yourself that you don't want to acknowledge. Even if you prefer to hold onto the status quo, dynamic changes are already afoot. Relinquish control and be ready to flow with the currents, wherever they may take you next."
leo,2014-01-01,"You are enthusiastic about setting new goals and you might think that nothing can distract you from your path. You may even try to start a diet today while the rest of the world is indulging in holiday feasts. You're strongly driven to clean up your act now that the Capricorn New Moon emphasizes your 6th House of Health. It's not that you want to have any less fun; it's just that you are highly motivated to improve your well-being. Your goals are admirable, but give yourself permission to enjoy the celebrations of the season, too."
virgo,2014-01-01,"You have a lot you want to do today and you're eager to get the ball rolling. The hardworking Capricorn New Moon highlights your 5th House of Self-Expression, encouraging you to show others how your creativity can add inspiration to an important project. Don't be surprised if someone likes your work so much that he or she becomes your greatest supporter. Try not to make assumptions about the roles that your allies can play. If another person wants to help, graciously accept the offer with a smile."
libra,2014-01-01,"You may be so engaged with your family today that you forget about the work-related pressures you temporarily left behind. The dutiful Capricorn New Moon falls in your 4th House of Security, requiring you to concentrate on important domestic concerns. Sidestepping an interpersonal issue isn't a viable choice because your frustration could precipitate an emotional meltdown. Thankfully, bringing secrets out into the open just might be the preventative measure you need at this time."
scorpio,2014-01-01,"Your attempts to minimize the intensity of a conversation today may be too little, too late. The Capricorn New Moon connects with shadowy Pluto in your 3rd House of Communication, obscuring the truth and complicating the issue. A recurring argument could feel like a runaway train, but you might not notice how far off the rails it's gone until you try to stop the ride. Although panic feeds doubt, deep breathing can bring you back to your center. Every word you speak resonates with more intention than you realize, so consciously replace fear with love wherever you go."
sagittarius,2014-01-01,"You might become quite upset today if someone assumes that your personal possessions are meant to be shared. The industrious Capricorn New Moon is hooking up with suspicious Pluto in your 2nd House of Resources, prompting you to overreact. You could even become hostile if what you own feels like an extension of your identity. If you can't share nicely now, then you probably shouldn't be playing with others. A simple change of attitude makes all the difference in the world."
capricorn,2014-01-01,"Your sense of power is a double-edged sword today because you could be driven by unconscious forces you don't fully understand. One way of handling this emotional intensity is to create a simple ritual that channels your intentions in a positive manner. The Capricorn New Moon joins perceptive Pluto and communicator Mercury in your sign, so write down your resolutions for the year ahead. Stating your intentions out loud helps you focus so you can begin to fulfill your dreams."
aquarius,2014-01-01,"You might be inclined to take care of someone else's needs today, but it's not a smart idea if you haven't been asked to help. Acting with compassion is always admirable, but an awkward situation can develop if you assist where it's not wanted. Don't express any negative feelings now that the Capricorn New Moon lands in your 12th House of Secrets or your good intentions may backfire. If someone resists your helping hand,  kindly wish them well and walk away."
pisces,2014-01-01,"An emotional disagreement with your friends or family members may lead to discouragement today if your allies seem to be especially hard on you. Group interactions have a high level of intensity now as the Capricorn New Moon joins relentless Pluto in your 11th House of Community. But don't focus your feelings on any one person; instead, disperse your current emotional charge over as many people as possible. Channeling your excess energy into positive action will help more than you think to lift everyone's spirits."
aries,2014-01-02,"Obtaining what you want today may be elusive if your frustration escapes its container and spills over into your world. Unfortunately, it's too late to enroll in a stress management class. If you are feeling isolated, don't blame others. Striking out only pushes them further away. Go running or hit the gym, but whatever you do, make sure to sweat it out. If you discuss your feelings with someone you trust, be sure to approach the topic gently and treat your confidant with the utmost respect."
taurus,2014-01-02,You might want to take off the padded gloves today and express your dissatisfaction. But remember that if you lash out (even if it's only with words) you will have to deal with the consequences sooner than later. Don't create conflict unless you are sure that you want to fully engage with the rest of the process. It may be much more beneficial to wage peace in your personal life rather than war.
gemini,2014-01-02,"Although you might feel emotional tension all around you today, you can be quite productive if you simply adapt to the changing dynamics. But if your need to share what's on your mind prompts you to fight the wrong battles, you could end up exhausted and not any closer to your goals. However, engaging in physical activity or doing any type of hard work reduces the stress and increases your chances for success."
cancer,2014-01-02,"This is no time to be harboring resentments because unexpressed emotions have a way of cycling back around and catching you off guard. You may like the idea of withdrawing socially for a while, though you still might engage in an intense interaction if you feel threatened. If stress triggers a confrontation today, be sensible and do whatever you can to keep the conversation civil. You don't need to take the bait if someone is egging you on and looking for trouble. Hot tempers won't lead to a cool solution."
leo,2014-01-02,"If you think your positive intentions are being blocked by someone today, remind yourself that the obstacles in your path aren't necessarily only on the outside. Naturally, you can't just snap your fingers and change the external circumstances. Nevertheless, you are fully capable of altering how you react to the situation. Instead of confronting anyone, take a few deep breaths and just get on with your own work. The less you push back now, the better."
virgo,2014-01-02,"Free-floating anxiety can be quite bothersome today, especially if you're trying to overcome feelings of isolation. At first, it might seem as if the solution to your dilemma is to share your thoughts with another person. But he or she may not be as accessible as you wish. Consider participating in a team sport or putting in extra hours on a group project. Either way, don't withdraw now; keeping your energy moving is the best way to lift your spirits."
libra,2014-01-02,"A business or romantic partner may act too impulsively today, but your feelings don't diminish in intensity even if you disengage from the situation. In some ways, you're more frustrated since a lasting solution seems a long way off. There's no reason to worry about fixing what has already happened. Just don't make things worse now by losing your temper. Remember, you can still let your emotions flow without drawing others into your drama."
scorpio,2014-01-02,"You might try to hold back a flood of fiery passions today, but your feelings are likely to spill out into the open anyhow. Be aware that others may be overwhelmed by your emotional heat wave if you suddenly release your stored-up tensions. It's time for you to do what Scorpios do best: transform the negative into positive energy. No matter what the question is now, the answer is love."
sagittarius,2014-01-02,"You have an overabundance of physical energy, but you might believe that there's no easy way to express it today. However, keeping your feelings locked up inside doesn't work, either. You may mistakenly assume that if others knew what you are really thinking that they wouldn't like you as much. Unfortunately, the truth is that by keeping secrets now, you're inadvertently building walls where you don't really need them. Be courageous; dismantle borders instead of fortifying them."
capricorn,2014-01-02,"Hopefully, no one will push you too hard today since you are likely to respond in a way that is quite disruptive. Your internal sense of your own power is growing. Like a capacitor in an electrical circuit, you might hold back now until enough of a charge is built that your release has the desired impact. Just be careful not to act too soon or your recent hard work will be for naught. Patience is your best weapon of self-defense."
aquarius,2014-01-02,"You are learning powerful lessons these days about what not to say. If you just express everything, the end result may be opposite of what you actually want. But withholding your feelings isn't in your best interest, either. Whatever you share now can affect others, so it's best to speak only after you reconsider your motives. Remember, it's not just about you today; act for the greatest good for all involved."
pisces,2014-01-02,"Although you may feel residual anger from a recent situation, you are entering a new phase when you experience a wider range of emotions. This means that, assuming you pay attention to what's in your heart, you can be more proactive in a positive manner rather than feeling like you are just at the mercy of the changing currents. Although you might not have control over your initial reaction to the current circumstances, you can choose how to respond. Demonstrate your good intentions by taking the high road whenever possible."
aries,2014-01-03,"A current relationship may seem overly confining, but you won't likely do anything to rock the boat today. You're probably more interested in dreaming about your perfect partner than making real changes. Thankfully, there's no need to worry about how to increase your freedom now. Go ahead and indulge in your fantasy; when you're finished daydreaming, return to the present moment and take a deliberate step that will make a real difference."
taurus,2014-01-03,"You're ready for a major change now, but you only want it on your terms. Your current need to be in control might make others anxious today because they don't understand how you can keep it all together in the midst of so much activity. Focusing your attention helps your cause. No matter what happens, concentrate on your goal and grab any opportunity to give it your best shot. You won't ever know what is possible unless you try."
gemini,2014-01-03,"Being wildly impractical only inspires you to plan your next little adventure. You are thinking in the broadest strokes and might quickly choose a journey to the other side of the world before settling on a trip across town. While others may laugh at you because they think your ideas are too outrageous, you just might get the final laugh when you send them postcards from Timbuktu."
cancer,2014-01-03,"Usually you're the one that needs additional reassurance in a relationship and expressing your feelings is a great way to move toward a deeper level of intimacy. But lowering your guard can't just happen overnight, especially if you've recently been hurt. Thankfully, you don't need to let your past negatively influence the present. Push back against your fears today, for your heart is much stronger than you realize."
leo,2014-01-03,"There may be a widening gulf between you and another person who decides that freedom is more important now than dependence. The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Relationships indicates a partner who is more of a spiritual collaborator than just a friend. Needless to say, this level of emotional detachment is not your regular path to intimacy. Keep in mind that you can have breathing room and still deepen the connection between you and your companion. If you love someone, set them free."
virgo,2014-01-03,"You may be feeling a bit out of sorts today, like you don't want to do your daily chores the same old way. You are seeking a radical new approach and are apt to become an eager student if it appears that someone knows something you do not. Although, education is not the only necessary ingredient, it is a critical part of the process. Paradoxically, stepping out of your comfort zone now might actually settle your nerves."
libra,2014-01-03,"Taking a risk sounds like a good idea today, but you must find your own center and get into a productive flow before you start something new. However, you need to be convinced that it can add more pleasure to your life. This is a very creative time for you and it's crucial to enjoy yourself while expressing your inner artist. Make an extra effort to acknowledge both work and play, for now these two opposites are intricately entangled. Follow your muse and don't look back."
scorpio,2014-01-03,"Even if previously hidden aspects of your personal history are quite unusual, you still might be ready to take center stage today and share your story. However, you may prefer to keep certain parts of your private life totally to yourself. The level of disclosure is your choice; think carefully about what to leave out since you can change someone's perspective of you in ways that you don't realize. Nevertheless, you could be radically honest, tell the whole truth and let the chips fall as they may."
sagittarius,2014-01-03,"Trying extra hard to concentrate is a sensible strategy because a variety of new possibilities are wildly intriguing now. Unfortunately, it may be impossible to shut off your curiosity once it has been aroused. Still, it's better to be interested in learning about new subjects than to be so set in your ways that you don't push beyond your limits. Obviously, you need to fulfill your commitments today, but it's imperative to feed your hunger for knowledge as well."
capricorn,2014-01-03,"You may feel as if you are standing at the edge of something entirely new today, yet you probably prefer holding onto the status quo as long as you can. Unfortunately, trying to live in the past isn't a useful strategy when the future is already here. Your life is changing in profound ways; accepting your new reality is the first step to reclaiming your confidence so you can take advantage of the wonderful opportunities knocking at your door."
aquarius,2014-01-03,"You might want to put a bit of distance between your thoughts and your feelings today, but the two seem to be interwoven in a complex web. The changeable Moon's current visit to your fixed sign brings powerful mood swings to your normally cool and collected world of logic. Don't bother trying to untangle the threads now. Instead, observe how these two modalities work together so seamlessly that they actually support one another. Keep both your heart and mind open for the best results."
pisces,2014-01-03,"You must suspend belief to enable your dreams to take hold today. Fortunately, the Moon's current transit of your 12th House of Imagination could jump-start a sweet fantasy. But don't waste any energy now attempting to clarify what is true and what is not. Instead, just assimilate the entire story for the creative masterpiece it is. You can always analyze it more deeply on another day."
aries,2014-01-04,"You may sense the turbulence in front of a big wave of change that's heading your way, and your uncertainty about the future makes you anxious. Fortunately, you're not resistant to the lessons you're learning now, but you would rather move through this phase with as little disruption as possible. Nevertheless, you could waste precious energy trying to maintain your current schedule. It's smarter to flow with the shifting currents instead of fighting against them. Adaptability is your key to success."
taurus,2014-01-04,"You might seek advice from your friends today, especially if you're having a difficult time cooperating with others in a group situation. It's challenging to avoid creating adversarial relationships now, yet a combative approach isn't helpful at all. Consider what your colleagues can offer and what you are willing to surrender in the process. Adopting a more positive attitude is your first step. Successful negotiation requires compromise on both sides."
gemini,2014-01-04,"If you're receiving mixed messages from an authority figure today, don't try to force a resolution yet because there's probably more people involved than you realize. Your key planet Mercury may be stressing you out now as it aligns with deceptive Neptune. Instead of pushing your agenda onto anyone else, let the situation develop on its own. Your most sensible choice will become apparent once others get a chance to express their desires. Clarity returns when you have all the missing pieces of the puzzle in place."
cancer,2014-01-04,"The difference between your thoughts and your feelings can be confusing as the current facts pull one way while your desires pull you in another direction. Unfortunately, the incoming data isn't very reliable now. Something that you know to be true today might turn out to be false tomorrow. Even if you want to trust your rational analysis, it's smarter to follow your instincts because they can cut through the uncertainty and lead you down the right path."
leo,2014-01-04,"You're fascinated by how powerful your feelings are now, but you secretly long for more stability in your life. Of course, you prefer pleasure to hard work, especially if you're not having much fun, so you may jump at an intriguing invitation from a friend. Don't try to talk yourself out of a good time even if you have chores to finish. Taking a break from the intensity of your responsibilities enables you to return with a fresh outlook on life."
virgo,2014-01-04,"You might feel overwhelmed by too much information today as your ruling planet Mercury moves through methodical Capricorn. However, it's challenging to concentrate on mundane reality because your dream world is so vivid now. Someone may pressure you to make a choice but try not to make any final decisions yet. So much is happening that you probably will want to change your mind in a day or two. Leave your options open as long as you can for the best possible outcome."
libra,2014-01-04,"There may be an important event on your calendar today but something unexpected could happen that requires you to postpone it. You possibly crammed too much into your day because you felt pressured to perform. But don't waste time worrying what you'll do if your plans fall apart; you might simply have to reschedule other commitments. If you surf the changing tides with an optimistic attitude, others will recognize your position and support your efforts."
scorpio,2014-01-04,"Your work ethic is being tested for a couple of days as practical concerns force you to modify your approach. You could run into a conflict with a close friend today, but don't assume that you have done anything wrong. There may be trouble if you make a decision that is solely based on your values, without considering how others might react. You'll be more effective if you're willing to change your plans for the sake of expediency. Nevertheless, you shouldn't have to compromise your beliefs to please anyone else."
sagittarius,2014-01-04,"You have a clear sense of the future now and know exactly what you need to do to be successful. However, circumstances grow complicated if you run into an unexpected obstacle in your path. Managing the situation may not be an easy task, yet it's crucial to give it your best shot. Don't go for the quick fix today; instead, set your intentions on finding a lasting solution that works for everyone involved. Keep your chin up and your eyes on the horizon as you push to achieve your goals."
capricorn,2014-01-04,"Your instincts might take you in the opposite direction of your logic today. To make matters more complex, your new plan may be contrary to everyone else's beliefs, too. You haven't picked an easy course to take because of the intense resistance you could encounter. Nevertheless, it's still smarter to follow your intuition now and leave the more rational approach for another day. Ultimately, others will admire you for walking your talk and reaching for your dreams."
aquarius,2014-01-04,"Unfortunately, you can't trust your senses today, making it difficult for you to distinguish reality from the illusion. Trickster Mercury is scrambling messages as it travels through your 12th House of Imagination. Using your fantasies to complete the picture may be the best you can do, but the results might be misleading. You could convince yourself of nearly anything now, so it's better to wait for clarity to return before making any critical decisions. In the meantime, relax and give yourself permission to indulge in a bit of creative daydreaming, instead."
pisces,2014-01-04,"A friend or associate may offer you information that contradicts what you already know. You could be so confused today that you don't know who to trust or which way to turn. Although you feel pressured to choose sides in a conflict that is unfolding around you, it's safer not to get involved in other people's dramas now. Wait a few days and see how the situation is progressing before supporting either position. Stepping back to do your own thing might just be your wisest move."
aries,2014-01-05,"Get ready for some real excitement because the cosmic seas are stirring up some pretty huge waves today as the Sun opposes giant Jupiter. Thankfully, the incoming swells become the well-formed breakers that a surfer loves to ride. You can see them coming at a distance and you know exactly what to do. So grab your surfboard and leap into action. Don't hold back; the good news is the positive energy is probably even stronger than you realize."
taurus,2014-01-05,"Your helping hand extends further than normal today. You might even feel like royalty and others can easily sense the special gifts that you now possess. It takes very little effort to spread your cheer through generous actions now, because everything seems to be moving in the right direction. Stay humble; don't take the good life for granted. A touch of gratitude goes a long way."
gemini,2014-01-05,"You're feeling lucky these days, but it's still not an intelligent move to bet the farm on an intuitive hunch right now. It's not that you couldn't win big -- you might. But there is a built-in instability in overextending your reach. Unfortunately, you may be more interested in theory than in practice today. Don't get so lost in philosophical discussions that you miss the opportunity right in front of your nose. Taking a calculated risk makes the most sense if you want to create positive change."
cancer,2014-01-05,"You may be generous to a fault today, setting your needs aside to care for someone you love. But nothing is as simple as it seems. Your good intentions could pull you into a mystery involving complex relationships and unresolved feelings. Although you have an optimistic outlook these days, your curiosity encourages you to investigate dark places you haven't yet traveled. Trust your intuition, no matter the twists and turns you encounter along the way."
leo,2014-01-05,"People in your life may have a difficult time with your lack of boundaries today. It's challenging for you to have a clear perspective, in part because you might be over-confident now in your own abilities. All you need to do is turn down your volume just a tiny bit. Thankfully, your day won't be any less enjoyable, and practicing a little self-restraint will help you maintain credibility with others in the long run."
virgo,2014-01-05,"It's not that you're losing touch with reality today, but you sure are intrigued by all of the creative possibilities. Your friends and associates are encouraging you to follow your dreams. In your own unique way, you're falling into bountiful Jupiter's trap of fantasizing about a brighter future. Go ahead and take a risk -- just don't do it alone if you think it's more than you can handle. There's power in numbers and safety in a crowd."
libra,2014-01-05,"You may be caught in one of your familiar patterns, where both sides of a dilemma appear equally attractive. Even if you want your freedom at work, you're also eager to take on new responsibilities. Making a smart choice could mean that you have to temporarily give up some of that very same independence you crave now. Although you might be considering a retreat from social life today, lean toward the side of engagement instead. Keeping an open mind is a good place to start."
scorpio,2014-01-05,"You're feeling more confident about your place in the world today and the potential for new adventures tomorrow. Although you have the capability to amass power and wealth, you are typically motivated by less material goals. However, the temptation now is to reap some of the fruits from the seeds that you've sown over the past years. There's nothing wrong with claiming your just rewards as long as you understand that your search for meaning need not diminish."
sagittarius,2014-01-05,"Bigger actually does seem better today, but the danger is that your current optimism might inflate a balloon well past the danger point of popping. Even if you believe you know when to stop, you still may realize that you've pushed it just one breath too far. Of course, once the balloon pops, you can't put any air in it at all. It's best to operate with a touch of caution sooner than to be sorry later."
capricorn,2014-01-05,"Your belief in a friend or partner may be enough to motivate you now, and you'll be fine as long as you remember to keep your feet on the ground. Don't get sucked into grandiose Jupiter's inflationary spiral or you might not be able to work your way back to Earth. Even if everything looks great on the surface, keep in mind that a good business sense and a methodical approach will set the most successful course. Use your core values as your moral compass and then stick to your plan of action no matter what."
aquarius,2014-01-05,"You can cleverly mislead yourself into believing that everything at work is well enough to leave as it is -- but it's not. On the other hand, things aren't that bad, either. Find a middle ground on which to stand because when opportunity knocks, you'll need to know where you want to go and how to best get there. However, being ready means that you haven't over-committed yourself to a project that is built upon the blue sky of Jupiter's expansive ideals and shifting sands. Give yourself enough room to grow."
pisces,2014-01-05,"You want all your family members and friends to understand what makes you tick. Others may be able to see the glint in your eye today, but they won't likely know what is behind your mischievous smile. Fortunately, jolly Jupiter is now moving through your 5th House of Self-Expression, enabling you to spread joy wherever you go. Happily, you should get what you want if you're willing to take the time and explain what's happening in the depths of your imagination."
aries,2014-01-06,"You might attempt to refrain from any sort of emotional outburst this morning, but your feelings move closer to the surface once the evocative Moon is back in your sign this afternoon. Nevertheless, it still may not be wise to share what's on your mind yet. Even if you don't intend to offend anyone, your words can carry more negativity than you realize. Instead of releasing your stress verbally today, find constructive ways to express your energy that you will feel good about tomorrow."
taurus,2014-01-06,There's no reason to hide behind carefully chosen words today because your true intentions will probably be transparent anyhow. Your secrecy might have a detrimental impact on a relationship now. Burying your feelings could also suppress the honest reactions of someone close to you. It doesn't hurt to be truthful if you simply remember to be kind in the process. Keep your heart open and you can't go wrong.
gemini,2014-01-06,"Your social calendar can be quite demanding today because you may have to be around people without much time left over for yourself. Although you often thrive on being busy, you long for a bit of solitude now. Nevertheless, it's nearly impossible to avoid interacting with others. Even if you can't escape the steady barrage of noisy distractions, you're able to make your life more manageable by consciously saying less and actively listening more."
cancer,2014-01-06,"You're ready to get down to work today, especially if you enjoy the company of your associates. Still, you might wish you could stick close to home, but balancing your personal activities with professional responsibilities sounds simpler than it actually is. Fortunately, the stress level isn't disruptive enough to make you miserable. Just remember to stay fully present with all aspects of your life and keep your sense of humor close at hand."
leo,2014-01-06,"You might be the life of the party today, especially if you can't rein in your own intensity. There's no easy way to just shut off the flow of your feelings, so don't even waste energy trying. Observing your reactions to the rapidly changing circumstances may teach you something important about yourself that you didn't previously know. But you must remain open to exploring your response as the energy shifts. Investigating a whole spectrum of emotions ultimately leads to the most personal growth."
virgo,2014-01-06,"The alluring quality of your feelings can be quite intoxicating today, whether you are in a new relationship or just fantasizing about one. You could even fall in love anew with someone familiar or discover an exciting attraction to a total stranger. Either way, your enthusiasm is contagious as long as you don't allow fear to stand between you and love."
libra,2014-01-06,"You may be argumentative today, yet it seems to you as if someone else is the one who is acting out aggressively. A playful interaction grows more heated as your key planet Venus heads for a hook-up with mischievous Mercury tomorrow. Unfortunately, the love planet is retrograde, indicating that your needs won't be satisfied just yet. Don't push for results now; practicing patience pays off in ways that are well worth the wait."
scorpio,2014-01-06,"A professional acquaintance may have it in for you, yet you can't figure out what you have done wrong. Actually, your behavior has likely been exemplary and others could be resentful of your accomplishments. Although you're tempted to escalate an uncomfortable situation now, it makes a lot more sense to smile, bite your tongue and simply allow a potential conflict to pass. You can always pick up your cause after the tension has dissipated and the coast is clear."
sagittarius,2014-01-06,"Although you might put your foot in your mouth today, your good intentions should cover for any social clumsiness. However, your patience may grow so thin that it's almost impossible to take extra time to listen to others. Even if you're paying attention, you could be onto your next thought so quickly that it doesn't really matter. Your day will run much smoother if you do yourself a favor now and slow down."
capricorn,2014-01-06,"Personal drama is in the spotlight for a while today, yet it could make you rather unhappy if you allow it to take over your day. Thankfully, your I-can-do-it attitude may improve the situation right away. Ultimately, you feel more empowered if you look at an emotional confrontation as your chance to move closer to someone special. Or, perhaps, it's time to invite healing to a conflict that's been part of a difficult relationship. Everything is ready to change for the better if you let it."
aquarius,2014-01-06,"A bit of intellectual banter can add to the fun now, even if there is a disagreement over the basic facts. Although you take a discussion quite seriously today, you're still light enough on your feet to avoid growing overly attached to the outcome of any debate. Instead of just stirring up conflict because it's a fascinating distraction from your regular routine, make sure you learn something new in the process."
pisces,2014-01-06,"A problem with your finances suddenly comes to your attention today, but it could be something as simple as forgetting to get cash from the bank or leaving your wallet at home. However, it's more complicated if you haven't been paying close attention to your cash flow. Avoid further difficulties by carefully reconsidering any expenditures prior to making an impulsive purchase. If you're unsure of your best move, ask a trusted friend for advice; another point of view might be enough to help you make up your mind."
aries,2014-01-07,"You might tell someone you trust that you want to take things to the next level, but it's not easy to reveal what's in your heart. It grows more challenging to remain open as circumstances shift. The Moon's visit to courageous Aries pumps up your enthusiasm, but you must push past your own resistance if you want to make real change. Don't pretend that everything is fine if you're fearful of emotional conflict. Admit your vulnerability and step into the unknown because that's where the magic is hiding."
taurus,2014-01-07,"There is no sensible reason to avoid a passionate person who plays an important role in your day. Even if your first impulse is to retreat, running away from an apparently unsolvable difference of opinions won't fix anything today. Although you typically enjoy simple pleasures, you now have an opportunity to deepen a relationship that can broaden your perspective and teach you something you need to know. Your unrelenting persistence helps to turn a tricky situation into a positive experience."
gemini,2014-01-07,"Your current restlessness is not about being bored; it's about wanting to escape from an uncomfortable emotional drama that appears to have hijacked your day. However, denying the truth only increases your anxiety now as you realize that your feelings don't disappear just because you choose to sidestep the issue. Although resolution won't likely be immediate, today's stress passes faster if you share what's on your mind."
cancer,2014-01-07,"Your need to express your creativity runs up against the judgment of others today. Nevertheless, it's wiser to take a risk now and do what feels right instead of trying not to rock the boat. Although a bit of caution could grease your path with good intentions, don't sell yourself short. If you give in to fear, you might not get to do what matters most. Claim your power and act with confidence."
leo,2014-01-07,"Your coworkers may think they know you, but your no-nonsense attitude might be hiding the depth of your feelings today. It's not that you're trying to mislead anyone; it's just that you don't think it's wise to reveal anything that increases your vulnerability now. Remember, you are not obliged to say more than is comfortable; it's yours to decide how much of your inner process you wish to share."
virgo,2014-01-07,"A loved one may come forward today to demonstrate his or her appreciation for your loyalty, but you won't gain any points by strategizing on how to achieve a desired outcome. Your shortest path to increased intimacy is trusting someone enough now that you can act spontaneously and let your feelings flow. Instead of analyzing every option and considering all the possible reactions, simply follow your heart."
libra,2014-01-07,"Other people are filled with surprises today and someone's unexpected actions could stimulate a shift in your thinking. A change of perspective enables you to see the current events in a whole new light, inspiring you to come up with original ideas. However, it may not be such a wise move to express every opinion you have now. Be smart and think twice before saying something that you wish you could take back. Your natural mental flexibility serves you well."
scorpio,2014-01-07,"It's tempting to become so obsessed with wanting change that you forget about the good things present in your life. The pioneering Aries Moon moves through your 6th House of Work today, encouraging you to add something new to your daily routine. However, instead of suddenly turning your life upside down to free yourself from a rut, consider putting your current drive toward improving what you already have on your plate."
sagittarius,2014-01-07,"Although you may be overloaded with responsibilities today, you are more than willing to set them aside in the name of fun or creativity. However, your reputation could suffer if you don't follow through on your promises. Fortunately, meeting your obligations doesn't mean shutting off your colorful inner world. If you're clever, you can keep up outward appearances while still fantasizing about your next big adventure."
capricorn,2014-01-07,"You can amaze others with your uncanny ability to stay on task today, even if your job isn't living up to your own ambitious expectations. However, your determination doesn't come from your attitude about current activities; it's more likely based on your long-term goals. As long as you hold onto your dreams, you'll be able to put up with nearly anything now; visualizing your current course will ultimately lead to success."
aquarius,2014-01-07,"It's easy to give the impression that all is well today because you are so busy that others only catch fleeting glimpses of you flitting from one event to another. However, if you stand still long enough your mask of satisfaction could quickly turn transparent, revealing a deeper malaise. Your inner peace isn't dependent on the happy face that you wear for everyone's benefit. You'll feel better in the long run when you stop hiding your true feelings from those you love. Let them show you they love you back."
pisces,2014-01-07,"Your self-confidence might run into a wall today if someone openly questions your actions or misinterprets your motives. Thankfully, the Moon's return to your 2nd House of Resources increases your belief that you have something special to offer and ultimately boosts your self-esteem. Instead of allowing yourself to get discouraged by self-doubt, put valid criticism to use by applying it constructively in your life. No matter what, there's always room for improvement."
aries,2014-01-08,"Although the discomfort you were feeling with someone close to you begins to dissipate today, the underlying cause doesn't automatically disappear. You might want to take the easy way out and simply move on. However, even if the pressure subsides you will just have to deal with this problem again, unless you face your denial. However, don't blow everything out of proportion; sticking with the facts is the best antidote to whatever ails you now."
taurus,2014-01-08,"You won't likely agree with the direction that's being suggested today, yet you still could go along for the ride anyhow. Actually, you might do your best work if you step back now and let others take the lead. Remember, your retreat is not a permanent change, but just a temporary modification to ensure optimum results."
gemini,2014-01-08,"Your confidence may increase throughout the day because you assume that you're off the hook from a recent melodrama. Your elevated self-esteem enables you to face your problems head on, even if you still feel a little scared. You're not one to eagerly sink into the darker mysteries of human emotion, but now your enthusiasm helps you go there with greater ease. Fortunately, your courage to explore beyond your comfort zone pays off sooner than you expect."
cancer,2014-01-08,"Your current lack of fear in an emotional interaction might get you into complex entanglements that raise old issues. You may start out with a light and easy attitude; however, feelings could quickly escalate and draw you in over your head. Your first impulse is about self-protection, but it's better to stand your ground instead of retreating. Fortunately, you can gain a whole new perspective by stretching beyond your limitations. You've waited long enough; it's time to go after whatever you want, within reason, of course."
leo,2014-01-08,"Your mind is brimming with new ideas and each one may sound better than the previous. Unfortunately, you might not have very clear judgment now as the Sun aligns with confusing Neptune, making everything appear enticing. Although you are eager to blast ahead with one-too-many projects, slowing down is the best strategy today. If the opportunity is as fantastic as it first seems, it will still look as good tomorrow."
virgo,2014-01-08,"Everything seems to be telling you that you can take it easy today -- but your demeanor grows more serious as the day wears on. You think that part of your job is to sort out what is most significant from the increasing amount of noise in your life. You might feel as if you can't hide from the barrage of data. Don't sever any connections now, for a gem of truth may be waiting in the piles of information coming your way."
libra,2014-01-08,"Your colleagues probably know what's going on in your life now without you having to say a thing out loud. Although you may not volunteer any clues about your emotional process, you'll still get your message across without even opening your mouth. Fortunately, your actions speak louder than anyone's words. Don't hold back; demonstrate who you are with your authentic behavior."
scorpio,2014-01-08,"A heightened state of anxiety might be exactly what you need now in order to propel you into action. But be careful not to overextend your energy because you may be in a state of accentuated alert. Everything seems equally pressing but, of course, you cannot do it all. This is an important growth phase, even if you're having difficulty maintaining a balanced perspective. Just remember, it's best to err on the side of caution today, for you can always do more tomorrow."
sagittarius,2014-01-08,"Lofty ideals combined with big dreams motivate you to set your goals high now that red-hot Mars is square giant Jupiter. Unfortunately, you might discover that your aspirations are out of place in your external world. Rather than giving up on your desire for fun and adventure, you may just relegate it to the realm of fantasy, where you are free to go any place you want. And although this is one way to keep your dreams alive, it's still fulfilling to share your vision with others when the time is right."
capricorn,2014-01-08,"Some of the resistance you recently faced is finally beginning to subside. The stormy waves seem to be settling back down and your confidence is returning. And although your attitude may not be completely realistic, you still stand to benefit from the power of positive thought. However, it's not wise to act until after checking out your best ideas with your friends or associates. They will likely be encouraging, but they can also be the voice of reason that you now need."
aquarius,2014-01-08,"Recognition is given to you now, especially if you have been working diligently. As recently as last week you might have felt slighted, but finally others applaud your unique contribution. But don't be cavalier; accept the appreciation with humility. On the other hand, there's no need to just dwell on your past efforts. This is a great time to start a new project as long as you don't spread your energy too thin."
pisces,2014-01-08,"Your balloon may not actually pop today, but it might not be able to grow any larger. The smartest way out of your dilemma is to make a plan that allows you to deflate the tension before it actually explodes. You had a role in creating the current conditions and now you must participate in the resolution. Instead of avoiding your responsibility, be the leader that you would want to follow. This is the stuff that heroes are made of."
aries,2014-01-09,"If you are ready to move a project ahead, don't miss your chance to take advantage of the determination of today's Taurus Moon. Although you might not zip along toward your goal, this cosmic energy is great for making methodical progress toward reaching your objectives. But don't plan on crossing the finish line anytime soon. Simply fix a position on the distant horizon, carefully aim your intentions and inch closer to your destination. Slow and steady wins the race."
taurus,2014-01-09,"There isn't anything wrong with having a vivid imagination, but your fantasies may fade just enough today to allow you to see the subtle differences between fact and fancy. The Moon's visit to your sign enables you to reestablish your center of gravity, especially if you are feeling uncertain about the future. Don't run away from your dreams, even if a more pragmatic approach might be comforting. There's no need for your fear of the unknown to stand in the way of following your bliss."
gemini,2014-01-09,"You see opportunities for advancement through a very practical lens today, but you still might not be able to make much headway if you remain stuck in the past. You could be reluctant to share your concerns with anyone else because you believe that self-doubt grows if you give it voice. There's no reason to push too hard now; slow your pace so you can put your clever ingenuity to work. Stay calm and trust the creative process."
cancer,2014-01-09,"Everything feels a bit lighter today as an ongoing inner dialogue between two sides of your nature begins to subside. However, being released from one set of worries can quickly make room for a new list of concerns if you start to question your ability to carry out your plan. Don't waste your mind-power judging yourself harshly before you even begin. Your journey may take longer than you think, so stay on track even if you're not seeing the progress you expect right away."
leo,2014-01-09,"This isn't the best time to visualize too far into the future or you could miss something critical in the present moment. The reflective Moon's visit to your 10th House of Career prompts you to wonder what business opportunities will come your way this year. Making plans is a constructive activity as long as you also pay close attention to your current reality. If you're looking too far ahead now, you might not notice a teacher or helper who is standing right next to you. What you seek may not be that far away at all."
virgo,2014-01-09,"Unchecked optimism is a significant part of your personal story these days and you are quite hopeful that things will only improve. Luckily, you can imagine a clear path that leads you to your preferred destination while the Moon moves through sensible Taurus. Take time to realign your priorities; the less energy you waste today, the better your chances of reaching your goal."
libra,2014-01-09,"You may wonder why someone might not trust you now, but your focus shifts as the day progresses. You become less eager to play detective and increasingly interested in demonstrating your creative side. More than anything, you want to be seen in a positive light. Fortunately, you can find the happiness you seek without too much extra effort. Let go of old fears and trust your intuition. Be ready to gratefully accept the admiration heading your way."
scorpio,2014-01-09,"You might have a unique approach to dealing with someone who has a very different perspective than you. However, initiating a serious conversation today could alter the way you view the current situation. What anyone else thinks about you is less important than how you feel about yourself. But don't try to avoid an intense interaction since honest dialogue is the best teacher now when it comes to acceptance and forgiveness, for yourself as well as for others."
sagittarius,2014-01-09,"Your life is about to get busier again, and although you might try to resist at first, this should ultimately be a positive change. Your new schedule isn't only about introducing more activities into your routine; you are also anticipating all that you can learn with so much going on. The overall intensity continues to accelerate, so conserve your energy. A steady work pace enables you to accomplish more with greater ease."
capricorn,2014-01-09,"You have a strong sense of purpose now, even though you might feel a bit let down if you haven't achieved your financial goals. Your stress level could escalate if you believe that you're running out of time. You are driven to push hard today for you fear that you won't have sufficient energy later on. Luckily, your fortitude is in better shape than you realize. Forge ahead with confidence; you may be happily surprised when you see how much progress you can make."
aquarius,2014-01-09,"You are naturally adept at keeping your desires and needs to yourself. Even if others don't realize your real intentions now, they're about to find out as chatty Mercury leaves your 12th House of Secrets in a couple of days and pushes into your 1st House of Personality. In the meantime, visualize your new direction to prepare for action. You won't reach your goals immediately, but you should notice a positive energetic shift within a few days."
pisces,2014-01-09,"You can label your process however you wish, but the fact remains that you're growing spiritually in ways that will continue enriching your life for years to come. However, your more pragmatic side encourages you to question the value of any impractical endeavors today. Don't panic; the answers you need will appear just in time for you to start your next magical journey."
aries,2014-01-10,"You have been running on overdrive and may be growing tired of the hectic pace. Now that the Moon is in sensible Taurus, you can retreat from the rat race and reconsider the assumptions that led you to over-committing your resources. However, no one expects you to set overly ambitious goals or attempt to accomplish the impossible. For now, it's more about just being practical. Weed out unnecessary objectives so you don't have to spread yourself so thin. Greater efficiency can bring you a different kind of satisfaction."
taurus,2014-01-10,"You can trust your senses now that the reflective Moon is traveling through your sign. You might even receive extra assistance and affection from the Moon's harmonious aspect to your key planet Venus. However, you have to strip away the layers of thoughts that distract you from remembering what's most important. Even if you withdraw from others today, don't let discouragement prevent you from enjoying your solitude. Taking the time to listen to your heart is a wonderful way to spend the day."
gemini,2014-01-10,"A relationship drama may have recently distracted you from your real responsibilities. However, it's time now to pull back from your friends and social engagements so you can catch up with your work. You might sense an invisible wall that distances you from everyone else today. You aren't necessarily lonely, although you could be overly serious. There's no need to pretend you're having fun if you're not. It's better for all involved if you are honest about your feelings and set healthy boundaries wherever necessary."
cancer,2014-01-10,"You're feeling more grounded today, but someone may persuade you to do something you're not sure about. Others are probably well-intended, but you prefer acting from your own free will. You don't like being forced to do anything. Keep in mind that your actions are more important now than your justifications. Go ahead and fulfill your obligations without holding on to any unnecessary resentment or resistance. Being a team player is admirable as long as you don't lose yourself in the crowd."
leo,2014-01-10,"You playful Lions are often more than ready for fun and games, and today you take your creative expression exceptionally seriously. Nevertheless, you still may need to postpone your current enjoyment to finish chores that cannot be avoided any longer. Don't stress; you will be able to kick up your heels once you have delivered on your promises. The sooner you get busy, the sooner you can let your inner child out to play."
virgo,2014-01-10,"You might have a very rewarding experience in your own quiet way, for your needs are pretty simple now. You could be content today as long as you don't reach beyond your own financial means or step out of your emotional comfort zone. But don't worry if you feel disconnected from someone you love; it's only temporary. Instead of trying to bridge the gap, use the available space to clarify your core values and reassess what you ultimately want your future life to look like."
libra,2014-01-10,"Your even-handed approach is rewarded today as conversations with a close friend or coworker lead to a sensible solution to a tricky problem. However, you may run into a speed bump midday as restrictive Saturn enters the equation. Don't lose sight of your ultimate goal, no matter what obstacle is placed in your way. Thankfully, the Moon then harmonizes with sweet Venus, ensuring smooth sailing for the rest of the day if you are willing to keep your heart open."
scorpio,2014-01-10,"The emotional intensity of the past few weeks continues to wane, but don't be misled; the roller coaster ride is not over. Unresolved issues will likely resurface for another round, but at least for now you have the luxury to choose what to do and what to let go. By judiciously eliminating unnecessary activities today, you can prepare yourself for the resurgence of passion and drama that is waiting for you around the next corner."
sagittarius,2014-01-10,"You may be so distracted by the wide world of possibilities that you could benefit by withdrawing from the outer noise and refocusing on what's right in front of you. It might even help to pretend that you are wearing blinders for a while. There are times when dreams inspire you and encourage your imagination, but this is not one of them. Keeping your thoughts anchored in reality is your best strategy for now."
capricorn,2014-01-10,"It's not the most opportune time to open your mind to many of the possible courses you could now take. You have already picked a direction and you will do best by holding onto that course as steadily as you can. Even if you're questioning a recent decision, don't make any adjustments to your plans yet. Your self-doubt will pass within just a few days and you will gain a brighter clarity about your future."
aquarius,2014-01-10,"You may feel out of sync with your world now as circumstances hold you back from getting what you want. It's not like you have anything better to do; it's just that you are more restless than usual. You're ready for something major to happen, even if you don't yet know what it is. Although you might feel lonely today, don't set out on your own to stir up trouble. Instead, stop to reconsider what you need from others and what you're willing to sacrifice to make a partnership more harmonious."
pisces,2014-01-10,"Even if there are areas of your life that need improvement, make sure to appreciate the things that are working smoothly today. This isn't a time for laziness or self-indulgence, but it shouldn't require high stress to motivate you to change your life. For now, you can modify your world by making small adjustments to your daily routine. Just don't expect a dramatic transformation overnight; it could take some consistent effort and self-discipline to achieve positive results."
aries,2014-01-11,"Keeping your true desires secret might seem like a sensible idea today, but hiding your feelings won't make them go away. Carefully calculating what not to say could even create problems that push your goals further away. Consider the impact of your words before you speak and be gentle in your delivery. Although sharing what's in your heart may not be easy now, you can do it in a way that cultivates a positive connection."
taurus,2014-01-11,"You are most content when your behavior is consistent with your feelings because you prefer to build your actions on solid emotional ground. Unfortunately, you can experience wide moods swings today as you gather more information about a complicated issue. Don't be stubborn and cling to an unproductive position. Your perspective will continue to shift over the days ahead, so try not to make any long-lasting decisions until you must. An open mind and a flexible attitude will serve you well."
gemini,2014-01-11,"Although it's fun to fly your thoughts as if they were kites, you're unable to foresee a sudden shift in energy that can cause a great idea to come crashing down to earth. The Moon's return to your airy sign blows your emotions first one way and then another. Enjoy exploring all the possibilities but avoid tying your success to any one flight of fancy until you have had additional time to think about the consequences of your plan."
cancer,2014-01-11,"Your feelings are changing, yet you still might want to hold on to an old emotional pattern longer than necessary. Letting go of your attachment to a lingering goal or a passing desire isn't a sign of failure; rather, it's a chance to allow new energy to enter your life. You can't expand your horizons if you're stressed by your struggle to maintain an outdated point of view. A simple attitude adjustment is all that's needed to imagine the opportunities ahead and move toward your dreams."
leo,2014-01-11,"There's no need to dwell on your discouragement if someone lets you down today. It's wiser to acknowledge your disappointment so you can fully release it. You might have to think quickly to cover for a friend's mistake because it's better for all involved if you can make it right, instead of blaming anyone else. Don't let your attention wander now since your focused intensity enables you to react to what's happening in the present moment without selling yourself short."
virgo,2014-01-11,"A wide range of facts and figures can be overwhelming today, especially if some pieces of the data are contradictory. You may feel compelled to sort through the pile of new information in your search for the truth. Just when you think you have an approach that works, something else happens to suggest you're on the wrong track. But don't give up even if you are frustrated with the process, for your current persistence makes all the difference in the world."
libra,2014-01-11,"You might be naturally adept at balancing on a metaphorical tightrope, but the level of difficulty is about to increase. Caution is advised because the intellectual tug-of-war may have you relying on trustworthy data one minute and subjective fantasy the next. You're leaning toward trusting your intuition, but finding a safe place to land can be trickier than you think. Be patient; there could be a substantial breakthrough later tonight or tomorrow, creating a whole new landscape to explore."
scorpio,2014-01-11,"Playing your part in a complex group dynamic might be challenging now if you feel like an outsider. Perhaps you imagine that others aren't receptive to your ideas; however, you could actually be acting out a significant role in their resistance. Don't be hard on yourself if you are unable to complete a task in the manner you prefer; you're better with words today than with actions. Avoid falling into a defensive mode by making clear points as soon as you can and then moving on to whatever is next."
sagittarius,2014-01-11,"You could get stuck on an idea that isn't worth your consideration today. But if someone with authority claims that your assumptions or conclusions aren't clear, don't just slip away to play a more adversarial role. Instead, listen to what you are being told and use the new information to change your plan and improve your game. Showing that you're willing to be part of the team now is more important than striking out on your own."
capricorn,2014-01-11,"You may have to respond to an unexpected change of course today and your ability to be compassionate could make the difference between failure and success. But if you think that someone is interfering with your plans, keep in mind that it's probably not intentional. However, a trivial issue is most likely the reflection of a bigger dilemma that's still in front of you. Nevertheless, the smartest strategy is to start with the small stuff so you can see immediate progress and gain momentum from there."
aquarius,2014-01-11,"You want everyone to acknowledge that you have everything under control today and that you're fully capable of handling nearly anything that comes your way. Nevertheless, too much confidence could attract a whole different set of problems. It's best to be cautiously optimistic while envisioning the future. But be ready to shift gears quickly as the driving conditions on the road continue to change."
pisces,2014-01-11,"Your inflated expectations inspire you to greater heights today, but they can also end up discouraging you if you are too ambitious while setting your goals. Being more realistic in your thinking now helps because you can't rely on others to be completely honest. Your friends and family might be so supportive that they tell you what you want to hear instead of the truth. Keep in mind that no one is purposefully trying to mislead you; however, your current lesson is about developing self-reliance and cultivating a healthy perspective."
aries,2014-01-12,"Although you might set out to accomplish an ambitious set of goals today, you may be thwarted by your lack of sound judgment. It's not that you are necessarily missing any facts; it's just that you could automatically underestimate the amount of work that's required to complete a job. Instead of trusting your first impulse, demonstrate your wisdom by thinking about all the steps involved in a project before making promises you cannot possibly keep. It's better to be honest with yourself now than to disappoint others later on."
taurus,2014-01-12,"You might think you're extremely clever today because your mind is buzzing with the crackle of excitement and the eagerness of anticipation. Unfortunately, your enthusiasm can land you in trouble because it's easy to get your wires crossed if you jump to an incorrect conclusion. Remember, just because you're able to think quickly on your feet doesn't necessarily mean that your thoughts are correct. Write down your best ideas because they may be even better tomorrow if they stand up to further scrutiny."
gemini,2014-01-12,"Your current tendency to exaggerate prompts you to paint a rosy picture of a difficult situation today. Thankfully, you're able to back up your point of view with what appears to be impeccable logic. However, people should be warned that you can skillfully bend the truth now without actually saying anything that is overtly incorrect. Safeguard your reputation by sticking to the facts instead of embellishing your story. An equal mix of hope and sincerity is a winning combination."
cancer,2014-01-12,"You might have your heart set on doing something so special today that it revitalizes an old relationship or opens the door to a new one. You could feel performance anxiety or an adrenaline rush as electric Uranus zaps your feelings with a stroke of lightning. In either case, don't let your fixed expectations get in the way of a happy surprise ending. It's best to keep an adaptable frame of mind so you can roll with the unexpected changes as they happen."
leo,2014-01-12,"It may appear that you have everything under control today and your positive approach enables you to accomplish a lot of work next week. But negativity might be lurking just beneath the surface and can throw your plans into turmoil. Don't complicate an interesting conversation by talking about your emotions too soon. For now, less is more."
virgo,2014-01-12,"You may be tempted to say something you don't really mean today, making your work life more stressful than it needs to be. Your planetary ruler Mercury becomes a bit too quirky for your taste as it moves through radical Aquarius over the next few weeks. Stop worrying about how you appear to others, but don't rock the boat just to rebel. Focus your tireless efforts on doing the best job possible instead."
libra,2014-01-12,"Although you're often very accepting of others, you may be quite self-critical today. Unfortunately, you probably have enough information at your disposal now to make a solid case for your own shortcomings. Nevertheless, a tiny bit of conscious intervention on your part might be enough to realign your perspective. Reawakening your confidence is easier if you don't promise to deliver more than you can in the first place."
scorpio,2014-01-12,"You could become a temporary workaholic today, especially if there are unfinished projects around the house begging for completion. Reexamine your motives because you might just want to show others that you can be a conscientious and dependable team player. However, it's tempting to take your good intentions too far by assuming such a heavy burden of responsibilities that you can't finish everything on your list. Remember, this isn't an all-or-nothing situation; moderate between the extremes by finding a healthy balance between work and play."
sagittarius,2014-01-12,"You might be ready to throw in the towel today because it seems as if you can't manage everything there is to do in such a short amount of time. Don't give up; your determination still has an excellent chance of paying off. Waiting for your efforts to be acknowledged at home or at work isn't much fun, but delayed gratification is surely better than none at all. Take pride in your ability to do what others thought to be impossible."
capricorn,2014-01-12,You may be torn now between following your bliss and having to come through on a promise that you can no longer take back. You could even get upset today with someone you like because it seems as if he or she says one thing and then does another. Don't bother engaging in a dialogue to point out your grievances; responding to the change of plans with a healthy dose of compassion and a dash of humor should leave you with enough time to enjoy yourself later on.
aquarius,2014-01-12,"You might get the chance to diffuse a potentially challenging situation by talking with others about what they want in the days ahead. Mercury's current three-week visit to your sign inspires you to think about your plans from an entirely new perspective. But in reality you aren't the only one in the picture. It's not just about your needs, even if it's tempting to focus on your exciting goals. Establishing healthy relationships depends on honoring multiple points of view. Respect is a two-way street."
pisces,2014-01-12,"You may become less goal-oriented in your thinking now that cerebral Mercury is traveling through your 12th House of Spirituality. Although you're typically quite comfortable visiting imaginary realms, your approach is more logical these days. However, rational thought can lead you to a very specific conclusion that might narrow your horizons. Avoid clinging to a single solution today; keep your options open and continue to try different ideas until something clicks into place."
aries,2014-01-13,"Even if you have been successfully holding it all together, your schedule might feel as if it could fall apart today. Luckily, this isn't as chaotic as it sounds, for you are invigorated by the buzz of activity all around you. Respond to whatever unfolds with a high level of enthusiasm, for you may not be able to tell what's most important until after the fact. In the meantime, keep your options open and enjoy the ride."
taurus,2014-01-13,"You might want to tie up loose ends today, but whatever isn't completed may not get finished for a few more days. Nevertheless, don't give up. Your current attitude matters more than anything, so keep your attention on your goals even if they seem to be temporarily slipping away. Maintaining your optimism is key to establishing the foundation you need. Remember, the momentum you are building now fuels the next round of hard work."
gemini,2014-01-13,"You may feel as if you cannot keep up with your own thoughts as the Moon continues to move through your sign today. Nevertheless, your willingness to talk about your ideas could prevent you from being overwhelmed. Remind yourself throughout the day to open your heart so you can hear the emotions behind what others are saying. Engaging in meaningful dialogue will help you gain a healthy perspective so you can sort out what matters the most in your life."
cancer,2014-01-13,"A secret needs to come out into the open today, so you can integrate this information into your current plan. You might have big ideas about how you want to change the dynamics of a relationship, but may have a hard time knowing how to do it until you have all the facts. Carefully asking the right questions now helps you discover what you need to know. Nevertheless, remain open to surprises and keep your sense of humor close at hand."
leo,2014-01-13,"Be wary of carefree friends who lure you into their dreams. In other words, fulfill your obligations and attend to your own plans for the future before going off in search of good times. A little self-indulgence sounds like innocent fun, making it tough to decline the invitation to play. Just remember that you probably won't feel so proud later if you abandon your commitments for the pursuit of pleasure. Oddly enough, taking care of business brings more satisfaction in the long run."
virgo,2014-01-13,"You are feeling stressed as you attempt to balance your responsibilities at work with your own career objectives. You want to be more responsive to the needs of your coworkers, but it may not be appropriate to step over certain formal boundaries. Even if there are big things happening in your private life, keep them to yourself for a while longer as you concentrate your efforts on your professional world. Don't veer off track now when you are making so much progress."
libra,2014-01-13,"Just when you thought you could stop and catch your breath, the pace picks up again. You might become so excited about all the possibilities today that it's hard to calm your nerves. You have too much to share and it's challenging to shut it off once you've started the conversation. As important as it is to get your feelings out in the open, don't say anything you may regret down the road. A dash of self-restraint saves the day."
scorpio,2014-01-13,"Others may perceive you as more lighthearted than usual. However, they could believe that you're trying to evade a sensitive issue -- and maybe you are -- but you are doing it for a good reason. Chances are that you're not in denial; you are just waiting for the best time to broach the subject. Trust your instincts to know when the moment is right. In the meantime, you might as well spread some cheer along the way."
sagittarius,2014-01-13,"Your optimism might get the best of you today, for others won't take you very seriously if you gloss over an important issue. It's not that your positive thinking is problematic; it's usually quite motivational. However, you could miss a crucial piece of information now that creates trouble and exposes sloppy thinking. Don't make matters worse by pretending that you have all the answers. Be courageous and take responsibility for your actions."
capricorn,2014-01-13,"Separating fact from fiction is easier now that your fantasies have retreated to the back burner. Your perceptual filters are working overtime to discern the truth today. If you have to let go of an unrealistic dream, be thankful that you finally know what's happening. An analytical approach can prevent unnecessary disappointment. More importantly, having your finger on the pulse of reality places success within reach."
aquarius,2014-01-13,"Knowing exactly what you want is crucial now that circumstances in your life are shifting. You are being freed from responsibilities that previously held you back. Obligations may not vanish completely, but you could have an easier time keeping up for the next few days. Don't make any significant decisions until you have a better sense of where the changes are taking you. Sit down and reassess your priorities to add more clarity to the picture."
pisces,2014-01-13,"You can say all the right words today, but you may be disconnected from your true emotions. Uncharacteristically, your heart isn't leading the way now; your head is temporarily in charge. But don't be misled into believing you have to make a choice; it isn't about one versus the other. Your current journey is all about creating a workable balance between your personal aspirations and your career ambitions."
aries,2014-01-14,"Your irrepressible frustration may create additional problems today. However, you could discover that the obstacles you're facing aren't about your external world. Instead, an old fear or a memory that suddenly resurfaces dampens your confidence. But don't try too hard to resolve the issue immediately; even if you're able to let go of the past, it will still take a couple of days to figure out what to do in the present."
taurus,2014-01-14,"Your thoughts might wander around your imagination as your fantasies grow out of control. Even if you attempt to communicate a simple idea, it becomes apparent that the actual process is not as straightforward as you wish. Don't worry; just ride the mental waves as if you were an eagle and then tell the stories about your journey when you return."
gemini,2014-01-14,"You are eager to explain your new plan today, but the reflective Cancer Moon offers you enough wisdom to rethink a recent idea before taking it to the next level. Don't worry if you get lost within your own mental maze now because your perceptions may be a bit fuzzy. Fortunately, your dreams are closer than they appear. Ironically, you can reach your destination faster if you slow down and take your time enjoying the scenery."
cancer,2014-01-14,"You may be considering taking a personal holiday sometime very soon but still might want to do something by yourself today. However, even if you choose to retreat socially, you won't likely become reclusive. You're too enamored with others now to fully appreciate your solitude. Even if you're unclear about how much activity to schedule into your life, be certain to leave room for the ones you love the most."
leo,2014-01-14,"It's time to catch up on old business while you have the chance today. Whether you work on a project at home or take care of miscellaneous errands, you can get a lot accomplished if you concentrate on the tasks at hand. However, it's not necessary to make a big deal about what you're doing now; sometimes working behind the curtain is more effective than performing under the spotlight. Don't try to please others with grand gestures; just set your priorities and get busy."
virgo,2014-01-14,"You might have to forget about gaining clarity now that mischievous Mercury is playing its trickster role. Emotions place a layer of subjectivity over your logical thinking, making critical analysis out of the question. Let your intuition guide you today, even if you don't have all the facts yet. Contrary to what you might believe, there's no need to struggle in your quest for the truth."
libra,2014-01-14,"Your message isn't as important today as you might think. It's the ideas you don't share that determine the course of the day as domestic interactions are complicated by unspoken feelings. Ultimately, it's much easier if everyone is emotionally transparent because having secrets only adds to the tension now. Keep your chin up even if you believe that there is no immediate solution to your current dilemma; your satisfaction is likely being delayed and not denied."
scorpio,2014-01-14,"You could be stewing in your own emotional juices today, without any obvious way to communicate what you're feeling. Thankfully, you're not isolated from others; it's just that language doesn't seem able to convey the necessary nuances of your inner experience. Try playing a song or reading a poem to express what's in your heart, rather than attempting to explain yourself in awkward detail. Give your inner poet an opportunity to speak and clear the air of any lingering tension."
sagittarius,2014-01-14,"You might like to escape from the hectic pace of today's activities. Luckily, there's a bit of magic in the air that enables you to cast a spell, suspending belief just long enough to slip into a parallel universe for a quick visit. If you keep up external appearances, no one will miss you while your mind is traveling to faraway places. Don't lose your connection to the real world; luckily, you can be in two places at once."
capricorn,2014-01-14,"You're not amused today if your tight grip on reality seems to loosen. Nevertheless, it may be nearly impossible to maintain control in the outer world while letting go on the mental plane. Although this process might not be fun for you now, it's valuable to learn that you can't always run the show. Fortunately, your fears begin to subside when others assume more responsibilities and you can relax."
aquarius,2014-01-14,"You may feel disoriented today from your deepening emotions, but there isn't much you can do to avoid them. Rather than tumbling down the rabbit hole without a plan, harness your passions by engaging them, instead of denying them. Thankfully, you have sufficient brainpower to do almost whatever you choose. Just don't forget to listen to your heart."
pisces,2014-01-14,"Your creativity is on the upswing today, but there are a few roadblocks along the way if you want to make something tangible. Your imagination is activated by Mercury's presence in your 12th House of Fantasy, but it's still difficult to mix your artistic nature with the logical approach that's required to get your ideas across. Relying on rational thinking could be a sensible strategy for another time, but now it's healthier to forget about productivity and just give yourself permission to dream."
aries,2014-01-15,"Although you fiery Rams aren't normally that interested in remembering about the past, today's Cancer Full Moon in your 4th House of Roots raises long forgotten memories from your childhood. You might want to cut a new path through your tangled emotional jungle so you can gain resolution on a personal dilemma. But don't move too fast; you still could have some important unfinished business to handle before you're allowed to proceed."
taurus,2014-01-15,"Your daily routine might be packed with activity now that the Cancer Full Moon is flooding your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. If possible, slip away from work for a short escape. Even if you are busy, you could still disappear for a while by relaxing or going out for a break. Keep in mind that how long you're gone is not as important as the quality of your downtime. Shut out the rest of the world so you can hear what's in your heart."
gemini,2014-01-15,"The protective Cancer Full Moon lights up your 2nd House of Net Worth, encouraging you to feel possessive about what you own. However, you must also consider others when making decisions about your resources now, especially if you are in a partnership. Don't force resolution on any money-related issues today; instead, let the discussion run its own course, even if it takes longer to find common ground than you expect."
cancer,2014-01-15,"You might be surprised by the intensity of your feelings today as the Cancer Full Moon activates your 1st House of Self. Emotions pull at every thought from their subconscious vantage points, challenging you to maintain objectivity. But don't ignore your personal desires; the wisest thing you can do is to practice balancing your own needs with the demands of others. Avoiding the temptation to retreat isn't enough; open your heart wide enough to let someone in."
leo,2014-01-15,"You would like to continue with your regular daily routine, including eating what's best for you. But unconscious desires can lure you away from your healthier resolutions as the Cancer Full Moon emphasizes your 12th House of Dreams. There's no need to judge yourself so harshly if you slip off track today. Just continue diligently working toward your goals and you will notice progress soon enough."
virgo,2014-01-15,"The nurturing Cancer Full Moon shines in your 11th House of Social Networks, bringing helpful emotional support from your surroundings. However, you're not being offered a free lunch because someone may resist the very same changes you want to make. Although problems can originate with anyone who could be threatened by your potential success, seek ways to work with the negativity rather than denying it. An air of cooperation invites lasting resolution."
libra,2014-01-15,"Taking care of others is your top priority now that the nurturing Cancer Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Public Responsibility. Your motives may be questioned if you don't deliver what's expected of you today. Luckily, you might be able to pull off an amazing turnaround at the very last minute if you truly believe you can. Keep calm and have faith in yourself; trust is your key to success."
scorpio,2014-01-15,"You are intuitively capable of finding the best solution to a complex problem today while the sensitive Cancer Full Moon emphasizes your 9th House of Big Ideas. Although you might tell others that your idea isn't really that important, the truth is that you're the one who can uncover the brilliant answer -- like finding a needle that was lost in the haystack. You have a real shot at getting what you want if you continue to hold onto a clear vision of the future."
sagittarius,2014-01-15,"You may feel as if you can't gain total control over your own priorities as today's Cancer Full Moon highlights your 8th House of Shared Resources. Including others in your process is a real challenge now. However, your potential loss of power might just teach you an important lesson about your limitations. Accept your current situation by honoring what you cannot change. Relaxing your drive allows the previously resistant walls to give way and reveal your path ahead."
capricorn,2014-01-15,"There could be an urgent conversation about your feelings that needs to happen today. Or maybe your spouse or friend feels guilty about a recent activity. Today's cautious Cancer Full Moon floods your 7th House of Partners, possibly uncovering a stressful undercurrent in a significant relationship. Your smartest tactic now is to ease your own anxiety so you can focus on what works instead of what doesn't. Communication is a two-way street, so start talking if you want to see results."
aquarius,2014-01-15,"Stop pushing your projects and ideas forward; instead, retreat to build defenses that will enable you to hold your ground. Thankfully, you could receive an extra boost of confidence if someone comes to your aid. However, it's crucial not to take on too much work that the tentative Cancer Full Moon occupies your 6th House of Efficiency, reminding you to conserve your energy. For now, do only what is necessary and take some time to unwind."
pisces,2014-01-15,"Your friends may be surprisingly judgmental, misinterpreting your true intentions and  dampening your spontaneous spirit. Thankfully, the kindhearted Cancer Full Moon falls in your 5th House of Romance and Creativity, encouraging you to have fun while expressing your inner child. Don't skip over any miscommunications, no matter what anyone says. If you run into an emotional trouble, take a few minutes and clear things up before moving on to your next playful adventure."
aries,2014-01-16,"You know exactly what you want today, but it might feel unobtainable if you're afraid that love is slipping through your fingers. Perhaps you created circumstances that set you up for failure. Or maybe you just want more than you can get. Either way, don't let your current situation hook you emotionally. Practicing a little detachment now allows the tension to resolve quickly, motivating you to get busy with a new source of inspiration."
taurus,2014-01-16,"You may first try to resolve the energetic imbalance by acting as pleasantly as you can instead of expressing annoyance with someone you love. Unfortunately, feisty Mars upsets your key planet Venus by urging you to make unreasonable demands today. But hiding your desires might make matters worse. Thankfully, discussing difficult relationship issues in a gentle and caring way can lead to better communication in the days ahead."
gemini,2014-01-16,"You might not realize how expressive you are today, but you could very well drive everyone nuts with your endless chatter. You may think that what you have to say is quite important. Even if it is, keep in mind that stating it once will probably be sufficient for others to get your message. A calm approach helps to avoid conflict and confusion right from the start."
cancer,2014-01-16,"Although relationship dynamics may feel out of balance today, a breakthrough is entirely possible. However, a sudden resolution of tension is more likely if you are less emotionally attached to what happens. But going quiet only drives the negativity deeper. Share your feelings, but don't try to steer a conversation in a specific direction. The less you have at stake now, the more you stand to gain."
leo,2014-01-16,"Unspoken obligations prevent you from doing what you wish today, but your guilt may drive your inaction more than any real responsibilities. No matter what you do now, you might not feel completely fulfilled. Working harder isn't the answer, but neither is escape. Do what is required, but don't take on additional tasks for the wrong reasons. Ultimately, satisfaction will be yours as long as you direct your energy toward obtaining tangible results."
virgo,2014-01-16,"You may be torn between managing the most practical aspects of your life and exploring all the creative possibilities. You want to stimulate your curiosity and fill your workday with new ideas and pleasurable distractions. However, it's wiser to stay on course and honor your commitments today. Keep your focus; the best opportunity might be exactly the job you are supposed to be doing right now."
libra,2014-01-16,"Relationships are the source of excitement now, yet they might not bring you the sweet pleasures you seek. Your key planet Venus is retrograde in practical Capricorn, inspiring you to seek safe and secure love. But you may have to fight for what you want as romantic Venus squares combative Mars. A less personal and more philosophical approach on your part can lessen the pressure and put others more at ease."
scorpio,2014-01-16,"You could restrain your emotional expression today in order to avoid an unpleasant interaction as your traditional key planet Mars is squared by vulnerable Venus. Unfortunately, your words can betray you, revealing more than you intend. No matter what occurs, let the conversation flow without making a scene; however, be willing to walk away from it quickly if you feel too uncomfortable. Living life with a lighter touch now makes all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2014-01-16,"Creativity and romance are dominating your imagination now, and maybe you just want to embark on an exotic adventure to stir up some adrenaline. Unfortunately, your desires may not be fulfilled today. Even if you are enjoying yourself, you might still crave more pleasure. If possible, turn your disenchantment into communication; writing down your thoughts or sharing them with a friend can transform this day into a memorable one. Acknowledging your blessings is a good place to start."
capricorn,2014-01-16,"Someone close to you may be withholding his or her true feelings now. As much as you would like to confront the situation directly, you can't seem to find an easy way to get to the point. Paradoxically, letting go of your attachment to know the truth can be just the right catalyst to start the process of resolution."
aquarius,2014-01-16,"As much as you may want to tell everyone what you know, today is a great day to remain quiet and just get your job done as best you can. Even if you feel somewhat lonely now, accepting your isolation could unexpectedly open the doors to greater self-awareness. Listen carefully to your own inner voice; it will give you the best possible advice at this time."
pisces,2014-01-16,"You feel like you need to keep something secret today, but events push you toward disclosure no matter how hard you resist. Still, you might choose to withhold a vital piece of information as if this will increase your power. Unfortunately, deceitful behavior only makes matters worse. It's better to get everything out into the open and then just let the events unfold however they must. The welcome sense of relief is well worth the temporary discomfort."
aries,2014-01-17,"Although you still have a bit of work to finish, the playful Leo Moon's visit to your 5th House of Romance and Creativity has you looking forward to an exciting weekend before it even starts. Even if your desires are already pulling you toward your next adventure, don't ignore your current responsibilities. Put all your attention on what must be done now so you are free to squeeze the most pleasure out of the days ahead."
taurus,2014-01-17,"Personal obligations may follow you into the office today. Usually, compartmentalizing your family issues is not a problem, but now their presence could make you less effective on the job. Luckily, there could be a brilliant solution waiting for you to find it. Remain open to new ways of approaching your responsibilities and you just might be able to get everything done. Thinking outside of the box could bring the breakthrough you were searching for all along."
gemini,2014-01-17,"Someone may disrupt your day in a way that is completely unexpected. He or she could bring you information today that transforms your outlook on your future plans. It isn't necessarily bad news; it's just that you might have to alter your direction. Fortunately, your desire for change is your greatest strength now because the shift will play out in your favor as long as you don't resist what's ahead. Your mental agility serves you well."
cancer,2014-01-17,"Financial responsibilities might come into play today as you concentrate on the details of your personal accounts. If you deal with money on the job, it may be challenging to stay focused on your work. Although your mind is full of unconventional ways to approach the tasks at hand, it's probably wiser to stick to the tried and true methods for now. Save your experimentation for another day. A penny saved is a penny earned."
leo,2014-01-17,"Your feelings are transparent now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign for a couple of days. However, the problem is that your moods may shift quickly today, giving others very little time to react before you're on to a completely different emotion. Don't try to withhold your thoughts; express them when given the chance. But remember that big changes are in the air, so don't make long-term plans based on your fluctuating point of view. It's not advantageous to follow every whim."
virgo,2014-01-17,"There's probably plenty of drama going on behind the scenes today, and you may be unsure about how much to share with others. However, something might slip out into the open, whether or not you are ready to deal with the consequences. Keep in mind that whatever topic is discussed now will continue to develop and change over the next couple of weeks. Maintaining a healthy sense of detachment gives everyone the necessary room to grow."
libra,2014-01-17,"You might have to set your personal needs aside today in order to help a friend out of a difficult situation. Although shuffling of priorities stirs up issues, you don't need to dwell on them in the present moment. You are ready to offer any assistance you can. Nevertheless, don't minimize your own desires, for the more you suppress now, the more anger or resentment you might feel later on. You don't have to play the role of a martyr to be a good friend."
scorpio,2014-01-17,"Being responsible comes naturally to you, but suppressing your feelings adds an emotional cost. You must find ways to release your anger through socially accepted modes of expression. Putting more effort toward your career or long-term goals may be one way of easing your frustration before it grows unmanageable. However, be careful that you don't over-react to a stressful situation today. Take the high road; what you do now will pay off over the months ahead."
sagittarius,2014-01-17,"You are very close to making an exciting breakthrough in your self-expression, but circumstances might hold you back just a little while longer. Don't let your anticipation run amok because specific tasks must be completed now if you are to realize your dreams. There isn't much time left -- or so it seems. Finish your work as soon as you can to make room for the future."
capricorn,2014-01-17,You might have to face a rather serious issue today that you previously set aside. Maybe you assumed that you could get through this period without having to handle all your responsibilities -- even though this isn't your normal mode of operation. Slow down and take a long hard look at the obstacles in your current path. They aren't going away until you learn the lessons they have to teach you. Be bold and accept the challenge in front of you.
aquarius,2014-01-17,"A friend or associate could present a real problem today. Although you can't easily avoid the situation, there doesn't appear to be a straightforward resolution, either. Perhaps the other party is being more obstinate than you expected, and all attempts at negotiation seem to be for naught. Nevertheless, don't dig in your heels; there's always a chance for a sudden shift in the interpersonal dynamics. Although you can't control someone else's response, your unwavering optimism can save the day."
pisces,2014-01-17,"Your work duties may be a bit overwhelming, but you must perform to a higher level of standards today. There's no way to avoid being judged for what you do now, and it's critical that you show your absolute best. But don't fall into the trap of believing that you must do everything all at once. Focus on completing specific tasks one at a time, and you will impress others with both your ambition and your follow-through."
aries,2014-01-18,"You are feeling more confident now about who you are and how you are living your life. It's as if someone switched on the lights and you're awakening from a deep sleep. But there's no need to overreact. If you work yourself up into a flurry of activity too fast, you might have to pull back later so that you don't go over the edge. Reassess your strategy and set a pace you can sustain for the long haul."
taurus,2014-01-18,"You may be in touch with an inner conflict today between two facets of your own personality, without a clear direction as to which way to move. However, the more you hold on to the status quo, the more challenging it will be to find resolution. You might waste precious energy trying to find a way out of your current dilemma, but the best answers result from being as open as possible to the changes ahead. Free your mind and the rest will follow."
gemini,2014-01-18,"You can dance circles around everyone today, since you feel like you are at the top of your game. Others may think you're particularly charming and witty now, but it's important that you don't overplay your hand. If you appear too full of yourself, your plans could all backfire pretty quickly. Enjoy the day, but don't push your luck. A touch of self-restraint goes a long way."
cancer,2014-01-18,"Open your heart to someone that you care about today, even if it makes you a bit uncomfortable at first. Although you can be oversensitive, try not to get caught up in worrying about the response to your emotional disclosure. What others think is less important now than what you feel; ultimately, you will be better off whether or not your current vulnerability is received with enthusiasm. Love is best offered without any expectations."
leo,2014-01-18,"It's time to reevaluate your own feelings and see how you can show others what you need without being too overbearing. However, you might be treading on dangerous ground. If you approach the current situation from a strictly selfish point of view, you may not be fully present when someone responds to you -- even if they're ready to give you exactly want you want. Active listening is just as important as self-expression."
virgo,2014-01-18,"What someone doesn't say now grabs your attention, as if the unspoken words have more power because they are kept secret. However, these hidden dynamics could result in a simple misunderstanding if you make a false assumption. Listen carefully and don't try to rationalize your way out of an awkward situation. Succinctly state what's important, including how you feel about the current circumstances, and then move on."
libra,2014-01-18,"Someone may come to your rescue now, whether you're being offered an attractive escape or a more meaningful chance to share what's on your mind. However, if there's no one knocking on your door, get on the phone and make something special happen. This could be a fun day, but it may not amount to much unless you are willing to actively co-create the magic. Let your inner child out to play and see where your heart leads."
scorpio,2014-01-18,"You may try to present yourself in a more official way than usual with the Moon in your 10th House of Public Status. This air of authority is probably a good idea, for your role in the community might have to come first at this time. However, you could end up revealing more of yourself than you intend, whether in personal relationships or with your colleagues. Even though you shouldn't leave your emotions completely out of the picture, don't express every feeling. Keeping your private life separate now works in your favor."
sagittarius,2014-01-18,"You might be feeling excited about upcoming opportunities, but it's crucial not to bury important information just so you can enjoy yourself today. It's not that you necessarily lean toward denial; it's just that things may not be quite as clear as you wish. If you find yourself drifting off too far into fantasyland, bring yourself back to earth where any practical decisions you make are more effective in the long run."
capricorn,2014-01-18,"You could be working extremely hard these days, for you believe that you need to make a significant commitment to your career now -- especially if you are to meet your long-term objectives. But this fear of failure may only be the surface of a deeper issue. Your critical judgments about yourself might actually stem from your unacknowledged discomfort with actually reaching your goals. It takes true courage to let your light fully shine."
aquarius,2014-01-18,"Tensions in partnerships may take center stage, whether or not you see them coming. Even if your day is unfolding as planned, you still could encounter a difficult interaction as you feel uncertain about your role in a relationship. It's tempting to hit the escape button now. However, striving for clarity helps clear away the clouds of confusion. Asking the right questions and keeping an open mind leads to success."
pisces,2014-01-18,"You may be required to do something for another person now without receiving the recognition you deserve -- and this could bring up familiar issues. It isn't that you are unwilling to help someone who needs it, and it's not that you are trying to avoid your responsibilities. It's just that you're weary of being taken for granted. If this is an ongoing problem, it might be time to let those around you know your true feelings."
aries,2014-01-19,"Your mind may be wandering around the cosmos today when it's supposed to be attending to more practical matters. But your mundane affairs don't have the same attraction as imagining the infinite possibilities in front of you. Nevertheless, drifting into Fantasyland is not a luxury you can afford these days. Put your feet back on the ground and save the dream surfing for some other time. A pragmatic approach to whatever you should be doing now is more productive in the long run."
taurus,2014-01-19,"Setting your responsibilities aside for one more day won't likely create any problems. In fact, declaring this to be a day of relaxation might be the smartest thing you can do, assuming that you have earned the time off through your recent hard work. Remember, you won't be able to escape prior obligations, but you could derive great benefit from recharging your batteries now when you really need it the most."
gemini,2014-01-19,"You might want to chill out at home today, but there may be too many unfinished chores that are demanding your attention. Confusion sets in if you allow yourself to become overwhelmed by the details. It's challenging to know which way to turn first, especially if you lose sight of the big picture. Step back from the noise long enough to gain a fresh perspective. Set new priorities before jumping back in for another round."
cancer,2014-01-19,"A long-standing relationship issue may be back on your plate today. Oddly, there might be no specific reason that you can discern as to why you're recycling the same old problem once again. Nevertheless, it's here and you intend to handle it once and for all. Whatever you decide to do about your feelings, be sure to come from a place of love rather than fear. You can't go wrong now if you let your heart rule your head."
leo,2014-01-19,"You may feel a bit lost today concerning a financial decision. If you're trying to decide whether or not to make a significant purchase, it's best to reconsider your options for a few more days. Your analytical powers could be a bit out of whack now, even if you believe you're thinking clearly. The good news is there's no need to rush the process."
virgo,2014-01-19,"You may be overconfident of your ability to create a logistically sound plan, but mischievous Mercury could have the last laugh unless you remember to take your conclusions with a grain of salt. You often take pride in your analytical skills, but Jupiter, the cosmic magnifying lens, just might out-trick Mercury the trickster himself today. Ultimately, it's more important to be realistic now than it is to be optimistic. A little self-restraint can prevent a lot of disillusionment down the road."
libra,2014-01-19,"It's easy to become so intrigued with your dreams today that you lose sight of what makes the most sense. Fortunately, you might be able to put off some of your real world responsibilities while you explore the distant edges of your imagination. Just don't confuse your fantasies with the truth. Giving yourself permission to go on a mental holiday can deepen the spiritual dimension of the day in a way that brings lasting value to your life."
scorpio,2014-01-19,"Sticking to your predetermined schedule today is a good idea because impulsive decisions could distract you from your most effective course of action. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to think about all the alternatives ahead of you even while adhering to your current agenda. There's no urgency to alter your direction right away; wait and see where this path leads before changing horses midstream."
sagittarius,2014-01-19,"Your current dilemma stems from a conflict between the very big and the very small. On one hand, opinionated Jupiter intensifies your need to find more meaning in your life. On the other hand, logical Mercury tells you to stick with the facts. You may not know whether to expand your thinking to get a clear view of the big picture or to narrow your vision to focus on the details. In either case, something is gained and something is lost. Nevertheless, following the middle path of moderation is the key is the quickest route to success."
capricorn,2014-01-19,"It's more comfortable for you to use the day to plan your next adventure rather than to actually do anything out of the ordinary. Gathering more data today is one way to satisfy your penchant for verifiable information to support your choices. However, you could reach a point where you can no longer integrate what you're learning. Sometimes it's wiser to set aside the facts and simply go with what's in your heart."
aquarius,2014-01-19,"You're eager to start something new, but reality still requires you to complete your previous projects before moving on to what's next. You might believe you can say yes to someone's grand idea today while still finding time for your agenda, too. However, you're unable to judge time and resources wisely now because you assume there will be an endless supply of both when you need them. It's wiser to err on the conservative side than it is to run out of gas prior to reaching your destination."
pisces,2014-01-19,"Your emotional flexibility is being tested today as you're asked to review your life from a spiritual point of view. But it may be challenging to let go of your self-image or to relinquish control in such a vulnerable manner. Thankfully, the rewards are great if you can expand your concept of love. Be specific when you ask for what you want, but remain open to growing in ways that you can't imagine just yet."
aries,2014-01-20,"You are growing more aware of your surroundings these days as you focus your attention on the people around you. You want to spend more time with your friends now, but you can't just walk away from your work. Be very careful about what actually makes it on to your calendar so you don't end up feeling overloaded. Oddly enough, you'll be more productive in the long run if you can fit some social activities into your day."
taurus,2014-01-20,"Although you're reaching further ahead now, your futuristic lean doesn't mean that you are any less practical. In fact, remaining true to your fundamental sensibilities is part of your strategic process. Ironically, you can have your cake and eat it, too. In other words, look forward to the exciting possibilities, but fix whatever is broken in the present moment. Your can-do attitude and unwavering determination are a winning combination."
gemini,2014-01-20,"You might not know what to do with the messages the universe is sending you now, but you sense that something significant is on your radar. You go back and forth emotionally, first feeling open and chatty, believing everyone is your friend. However, only a few moments later you may pull back, realizing that you should be more careful about what you say and who you trust. Taking a wait-and-see approach is your smartest strategy and gives you the best of both worlds."
cancer,2014-01-20,"This is an odd time of year for you because you really just want to dig yourself deep into your cave and hibernate. But a glint of awareness sparks your soul and sets your thoughts on the upcoming spring -- even if it is, in fact, still a long way off. Don't be overly concerned if you're hiding safely behind your protective shell; just use this time wisely to recharge your batteries and to work out the details of your next adventure."
leo,2014-01-20,"You have faced some big issues recently and you should feel proud of your progress. Although the stress isn't quite over, the energy is beginning to settle down today. But you're not off the hook just yet because relationship dynamics intensify over the next few weeks. This extra spark of electricity applies to all your interactions, not just romantic encounters; just be aware that your passions are running very strong now. Think twice before turning your initial attractions into action. You will make wiser choices if you're not in such a hurry."
virgo,2014-01-20,"It's as if you have received temporary permission from the universe to be even quirkier than usual -- not that anyone necessarily knows about all your eccentricities. Your imagination is overflowing now and you may finally feel free to demonstrate what's in your heart to an appreciative audience. Even if you choose not to share your feelings, they will be obvious anyway, so there really isn't any point in hiding them. Sometimes taking a risk is the best way to get closer to someone you love."
libra,2014-01-20,"You are entering a productive time of year as the Sun moves through unconventional Aquarius, a fellow air sign. This solar movement inspires your creativity, encourages spontaneous behavior and lightens your attitude. There's no need to rush anything. Keep in mind that it might take a few more days to fully shift into this expressive phase. In the meantime, establish a healthy balance between work and play so you can carve out more time for pleasurable pursuits."
scorpio,2014-01-20,"You might begin the day feeling on edge, as if there aren't any solutions for the problems that are bothering you. However, tides do change, and by midday the earlier dilemmas have settled down enough for you to manage them effectively. Keep in mind that things are even more complicated because your inner feelings don't seem to match what you are showing to others. Nevertheless, it's also your time to grow in ways you never expected as long as you keep your heart open."
sagittarius,2014-01-20,"Your life might mellow out a little and, luckily, just in the nick of time. You've been riding some pretty big emotional waves lately and although most of it was pleasant, it is still exhausting. Now, however, you are entering a time of accentuated communication that shifts the energy into the mental realms. You could be networking more than usual because of your work or your role in the community. Even if you are busy, don't lose sight of your own personal goals."
capricorn,2014-01-20,"It might seem as if the spotlight is no longer shining on your corner of the world, and that's just fine with you. Finally, you can get back to the real work at hand, instead of being required to play to the audience on command. Establish a productive work pace early on so you can take care of business right away. It won't take long to feel good about your accomplishments once you're back in your comfort zone."
aquarius,2014-01-20,"The Sun is now making its annual trek through your sign, signaling the beginning of your astrological birthday month. Regardless of when your special day is, use these next four weeks to dream wildly about your year ahead. Light candles, visualize your future, and then blow the candles out and make a wish. You can do this simple ritual as often as you please. You may be happily surprised by the magic you manifest."
pisces,2014-01-20,"It's time to tie up the loose ends of your life -- and you may have more frayed edges now than others realize. In fact, you might secretly thrive on the uncertainty of boundaries. However, the opportunity for positive change is on its way, and you can fully embrace it if you are not held back by all the little things that you meant to do, but haven't yet completed. Don't wait for a better time; get busy and make room for your future today."
aries,2014-01-21,"You are quite eager to go along with your friends today because you can imagine the potential for new experiences wherever you look. Luckily, it's natural to set aside your own agenda while doing what makes the most sense for everyone involved. But you must take time and figure out how to meet your needs, too. Unfortunately, trusting someone with your fate grows more difficult each hour that you hesitate. Find the magical balance between waiting for the right moment and missing your chance."
taurus,2014-01-21,"Establishing a brand new schedule for your diet and exercise routine might be tricky, especially if you're secretly comfortable with your current state of affairs. Although you may be more certain about what you want, you still could find it hard to motivate yourself to change. Gathering more data is not necessary, for you probably have already done enough research. Anything healthy you do now can lead to an improvement in your physical well-being, so the sooner you take action, the better."
gemini,2014-01-21,"You might think that everything is rolling your way today; unfortunately, the logistics become more complicated as time goes on. Even if it seems as if there's a lot of potential enjoyment just around the next corner, you can't think about playtime until you've handled your responsibilities. Fortunately, once you're finished with all your obligations, you're game for just about anything. Work extra hard so you have time to pursue something more pleasurable later on."
cancer,2014-01-21,"It's a good thing if you're feeling flexible today because you might have to change your plans more than once. Domestic tension may be heating up and you could be required to step in and mediate a family disagreement. However, the current problem isn't about someone being right and someone else being wrong. Concentrate your attention on helping everyone involved reach common ground, even if their perspectives still differ on a fundamental issue."
leo,2014-01-21,"You're able to deftly navigate your way through a complex interaction with conflicting groups of people today. Although everyone is stubbornly holding on to a different set of interests, your intervention may be sufficient to energetically shift the entire dynamic. On another day, you might have just given up and let it all play out on its own. Fortunately, you can maintain control now while still appearing as if you don't have your hands on the steering wheel."
virgo,2014-01-21,"Instead of doubting your recent decision any longer, accept your previous judgment as being logically sound. It's already well past the time to consider whether or not to proceed. You have moved beyond the point of no return, even if you're still experiencing uncertainty. There's no need to question your choices again; consciously shift your awareness now from the subjective inner realms toward taking the next steps on your journey."
libra,2014-01-21,"Don't waste time worrying about making a final choice today; instead use your current ambiguity to express yourself in a creative manner. Sometimes it's critical to demonstrate your leadership style by behaving with clear authority, but now you are appreciated even more when you're honest about your crisis of confidence. Be open and take whatever time is necessary to share your concerns rather than just leaving everyone in the dark."
scorpio,2014-01-21,"You are often tempted to sink into the recesses of your own subconscious mind. On occasion these inner journeys might be overwhelming and could even pull you into deep emotional turmoil. However, today you can dance around the edges of the shadows with ease as the Moon travels through your 12th House of Imagination. Let your feelings go and follow your dreams."
sagittarius,2014-01-21,"You may unexpectedly find yourself in an intense power struggle when dealing with friends today. However, your relationships can be positively impacted by the social Libra Moon's visit to your 11th House of Groups, where it alleviates some of the pressure you are experiencing. It doesn't matter in the long run how you feel right now; just keep meeting your professional commitments with integrity and don't worry about coming out on top. You currently have a better chance of succeeding if you remember not to take things so personally."
capricorn,2014-01-21,"Leading by example may be especially challenging today as long as you continue to change your mind from minute to minute. It's difficult to trust your decisions now, even if you have the intuitive data that you want to justify your choices. But don't get hung up looking for a final answer to any one particular question. Just respond in the moment to the best of your current ability and be ready to move on."
aquarius,2014-01-21,"You appear quite intense now that the willful Sun is traveling along in your sign. Luckily, today the Sun is receiving support from the Moon in fellow air sign, Libra. However, you could also feel dreamier than usual, as if your wishes have a life of their own. Be bold and take action as needed; just remember that karmic Saturn will judge you harshly if you believe that escape through fantasy is a viable option."
pisces,2014-01-21,"You have a bit of magic up your sleeve, and luckily it is there today when you need it most. Even if you are required to deal with powerful people who might be investing in your success, there's no reason to be intimidated. Just stay fully present with your truth because maintaining your integrity sets the stage for successfully managing issues that will demand resolution in the near future."
aries,2014-01-22,"You feel so tightly wound today that it's a smart idea to find ways to blow off some excess energy. You might believe that you can remain cool in a simple interaction with a friend but if previously defined roles break down, engaging in a heated discussion is inevitable now. Unfortunately, losing your temper won't make anyone happy. To avoid an unnecessary battle, consciously back down without trying to justify your position. Take the high road and give peace a chance."
taurus,2014-01-22,"You know that you have a job to do now, but you might not be able to figure out exactly what it is. Even if you lose focus on the logistics, don't worry about regaining it yet. Instead of attempting to make sense of your dreams, give them time to reveal their purpose so their meaning will become more obvious. It doesn't matter if your newly discovered aspirations are practical or not. Just let them grow and develop a life of their own."
gemini,2014-01-22,"You might allow a philosophy or a belief override your common sense now without even knowing it. This obsession can be a major source of trouble with those around you. Most often your ideas are useful, but today they tend to alienate you, reinforcing your differences and not your similarities. Thankfully, your good intentions and quick wit can save the day and lift others out of their doldrums. Hopefully, this energy positively reflects back on you, giving you an instant boost of confidence."
cancer,2014-01-22,"You may assume you can change an old habit instantly today, especially if you spend time visualizing the desired outcome in your mind's eye. Unfortunately, you might become overly possessive, attempting to hold onto your past if someone appears to be taking something away from you. Paradoxically, your resistance could create the opposite effect of what you want. Instead of struggling, give yourself permission to enjoy the present moment, no matter how the situation unfolds."
leo,2014-01-22,"You can't understand the motives of others very clearly because you are looking at the world through rose-colored glasses today. Your eagerness to defend yourself or someone you love is admirable, but your current intensity can complicate things even more. Don't be so quick to fight for your beliefs now. Wait a few days to see if your position changes before escalating a mere difference of opinion into an open conflict. Expressing yourself creatively is a much better use of your time now, anyway."
virgo,2014-01-22,"Crossing items off your to-do-list is a piece of cake today with the Sun and Mercury both visiting your 6th House of Details. However, it's nearly impossible to know why you are traveling along your current path, even if your intentions are clear. But this isn't the time to question your choices or doubt your skills. Simple action is all that's required now to make tangible progress toward your goals. A brilliant breakthrough is closer than you think."
libra,2014-01-22,"Connecting with the sources of inspiration in your life requires your undivided attention today. Fortunately, the Moon's current visit to your sign continues to remind you that the matrix of support flows through family and those you love. However, if you're overly idealistic about relationships now, you might experience disappointment. Remember, maintaining your integrity is ultimately more important than anything else."
scorpio,2014-01-22,"You're living under a magical spell now that could date all the way back to your childhood days. Unfortunately, it's difficult to tell which memories are based upon truth and which ones are fabricated in the depths of your subconscious mind. It can be helpful to be a detective when it comes to your heart because once you get to the bottom of the situation, your feelings are a lot easier to sort out. Today's self-exploration might just lead to tomorrow's treasure."
sagittarius,2014-01-22,"Slowing down and establishing a sustainable pace today enables you to accomplish a lot more than you expect. In fact, it's imperative to have your thoughts in order prior to beginning a new project. Take time to think your strategy all the way through to completion before you initiate any action. You can save yourself from a future headache by doing your homework first. Creating a winning plan on paper is a great place to start."
capricorn,2014-01-22,"You want additional clarity before making an important financial decision today, and thankfully your current window of opportunity will remain open for a few more days. It's challenging to respond to a professional dilemma now because a temporary loss of self-confidence can muddle your thinking. There's no need to stress; your optimism will surely return soon. In the meantime, don't make any sudden moves until you take the time to reevaluate your priorities."
aquarius,2014-01-22,"You may feel a strong rebellious streak within and wonder if you'll be able to keep your emotions in check today. You don't want to lose your cool or do anything you might regret but your impulsive desires continue to intensify throughout the day. Meanwhile, the even-keeled Libra Moon enables you to pull off an amazing balancing act. Nevertheless, doing a bit of physical labor or engaging in a high-intensity workout now could be enough to calm your restless spirit."
pisces,2014-01-22,"It's easy to get in touch with the magic of your imagination now that the radiant Sun and clever Mercury are traveling through your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Luckily, you also receive an energetic boost from go-getter Mars, operating behind the scenes from your 8th House of Intimacy. It doesn't matter that other people may not even know that something special is brewing within your mind. Go ahead and let your fantasies run wild; your creativity will break through the surface soon enough."
aries,2014-01-23,"You might be thinking about the significance of a relationship today and trying to get a handle on how previous choices brought you to where you are now. This is a good day for deep contemplation, since you can see a variety of paths ahead, yet you may not be emotionally tied to any one of them. But executing a new plan will be tougher than making it, so don't try to accomplish too much too quickly. Give your current ideas enough time to develop before leaping into action."
taurus,2014-01-23,"You may have a long list of specific tasks you want to complete today, but your attention keeps shifting to personal matters. Relationship issues are more pressing now, although you still might try to steer clear of a drama that's intensifying around you. Instead of being irritated by emotions that don't fit into your preconceived agenda, recognize that interactions with others make your life richer and more meaningful. Opening your heart strengthens the bonds with those you love."
gemini,2014-01-23,"Although you might not be interested in establishing a deeper connection with a friend now, you have no reason to avoid closer contact either. You may feel rather neutral at first, but a complex array of attractions can draw you into unfamiliar ground if you allow circumstances to unfold on their own. As long as you know what you want from a potential partner, this is a smart time to move through old relationship fears and explore the uncharted possibilities."
cancer,2014-01-23,"You can make the best of a difficult situation today by setting aside your long-term plans and simply focusing on the present circumstances. Your clarity of perception is refreshing, but as soon as your emotions begin to run wild, everything changes and the interpersonal dynamics become trickier to manage. Observe how you unconsciously slip into thinking about the future and remember to keep bringing your thoughts back to the here and now. Cultivating a positive perspective is your best way forward."
leo,2014-01-23,"You might feel resigned to do whatever is expected, but it can be challenging today if a family member or close friend has a very different way of looking at the situation. However, it's not just that you are agreeing to disagree about the next course of action, it's that you approach the issue from fundamentally different assumptions. Don't try to convince anyone that your position is better than the rest. Acknowledge and accept the reality of multiple points of view and get on with your day."
virgo,2014-01-23,"You could be feeling somewhat anxious today, even if everything is going along without a hitch. Your stress stems from the uncertainty you experience when you are drawn into emotional issues that pull you away from your logical view of life. However, it's not a smart time to remain cool and detached from your heart. Jump in and get your hands dirty with your messy and irrational passions without worrying about cleaning up until later on."
libra,2014-01-23,"Get your head out of the clouds and be as practical as possible today. If you have been avoiding financial issues, take care of business now while you have the opportunity to make real progress. Don't be afraid to postpone your fun in order to tie up loose ends. Ultimately, knowing where you stand with respect to your money brings a peace of mind that's longer lasting than transient pleasures. Your fiscal stability adds to your sense of self-worth."
scorpio,2014-01-23,"Even if you're making more decisions using logic instead of intuition now, the Moon's return to your sign today eases you gently back into more subjective realms. Set your analytical thinking aside for a bit and embrace a more instinctive approach that's quite familiar to you. But don't try to hold on to any one feeling for too long; allow your moods to change naturally. You can trust your inner voice once your emotions settle down."
sagittarius,2014-01-23,"There's no sensible reason to run around in circles trying to get things done today. If you are currently meeting resistance, listen to the message that's being given to you, instead of frustrating yourself by fighting the prevailing tides. Give yourself permission to embark on an imaginative adventure now, even if others can't come along for the ride. Remember, if the journey is to be worthwhile, it must start from within."
capricorn,2014-01-23,"The energetic emphasis is shifting today, adding significance to your interactions with associates at work and friends at play. Re-prioritizing your relationships makes sense now; however, this reevaluation isn't about any one person in particular. Instead, take time to contemplate your role within your larger network. Find a place to stand that balances your personal needs with those of your social and professional groups. When it comes to your heart, choose quality over quantity for the best connections."
aquarius,2014-01-23,"Circumstances at work could be running rather smoothly today, but the surface appearance might be misleading. You may be irritated that your plans are not playing out in reality as expected and you're not sure how to get things back on track. The more you think about this dilemma, the more unsolvable it seems. The deeper issues won't be fixed so easily, so let them go for now. You will be better equipped to focus on a long-term strategy in a few days. In the meantime, count your blessings and smile."
pisces,2014-01-23,There's nothing wrong with going deep to seek new perspectives on old problems as long as you come up for air once you find what you're looking for. Sharing your inner process with someone you trust is easier now that the Moon is traveling through your 8th House of Intimacy. Just remember to move forward rather than lingering in the past. Use the previously hidden treasures you discover to spark your imagination and lead you into the future.
aries,2014-01-24,"You may avoid the most direct path to your goals now because you enjoy the interesting diversions that others present along the way. Although it's not easy to concentrate, today you could benefit from a concerted effort to stay focused. Ultimately, exercising self-discipline is more effective than following someone else's demand that you obey the rules. Accept your responsibilities as a challenge; you can earn respect by sticking to the program and fulfilling your commitments."
taurus,2014-01-24,"A close friend might disappoint you today and you could even feel betrayed and angry at first. Nevertheless, the Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others urges you to reconsider your initial reaction. Let go of any outmoded emotional responses, for you have a chance to make important changes now that can ultimately increase your security rather than jeopardizing it. Reassessing what you want from a relationship is a good place to start."
gemini,2014-01-24,"Keep your chin up and work hard today, even if your chores aren't very satisfying. The rewards will arrive later on if you take care of the toughest jobs now. But this isn't about going against the grain or bucking the system. Even if you believe you have a smarter way to run things, you're better off to follow a traditional path and obey those with authority until you have completed your obligations. Whistle while you work and you'll be done before you know it."
cancer,2014-01-24,"Oddly enough, taking care of your responsibilities might lead to a romantic opportunity today, or, at least, an enjoyable encounter. You may feel overly cautious about overstepping social boundaries, nevertheless, don't rule out the possibility of getting more personal with an acquaintance. Just remember, pushiness won't work in your favor; a friendly gesture is enough to get your message across. Then wait to see what develops before making your next move."
leo,2014-01-24,"You are often the most sociable one in your group, but you may do well to pass on the party invitation now that the Moon is moving through your 4th House of Emotional Security. Of course you still want to enjoy yourself, but your contemplative state of mind suggests that an evening at home alone or with your family might be more in sync with your current mood. Taking some quality time for yourself today may be enough to put you back in a more outgoing attitude by tomorrow."
virgo,2014-01-24,"Although you might offer your best ideas to someone else today, your assistance may not be too well received. It doesn't matter that your intentions are honorable; a simple comment can be taken as a serious criticism. Going out of your way to share positive words and gentle encouragement along with your suggestions gives you a better chance of being heard now. Your kindness will be appreciated more than you think."
libra,2014-01-24,"The emphasis on your financial picture continues with the reflective Moon still traveling through your 2nd House of Personal Resources. If you are thinking about making a large purchase, consider the long-term value of your possible acquisition. If it isn't a good deal, let it go or try negotiating a price that you could more readily afford. Remember, there's a big difference between what you want and what you actually need."
scorpio,2014-01-24,"It's time to focus on yourself for a while by putting sensible limits on your social activities and commitments. Exercising self-restraint makes you more effective today and could even simplify your life in ways you never imagined. You may be tempted to start something new, but it's wiser to wait a few days before forging ahead. Instead of scattering your energy now, concentrate on making practical plans to reach your personal goals."
sagittarius,2014-01-24,"You might need to adjust your plans today due to circumstances beyond your control. And even if you don't have to reschedule your entire day, it's still possible to lose your cool if something throws you out of rhythm. Remaining light on your feet helps you maintain your balance now, for an unexpected turn of events could be a blessing in disguise. Luckily, you may be released from an unwanted obligation and end up having more time to yourself. Stay calm and keep your sense of humor close at hand."
capricorn,2014-01-24,"A group of your friends may want to include you in their fun plans, but you aren't so quick to say yes today. The secretive Scorpio Moon is approaching somber Saturn in your 11th House of Community, encouraging self-restraint when it comes to socializing in a group setting. Don't judge yourself too harshly if you're feeling reclusive. Honor your needs by graciously declining the invitation and creating an evening just for you. Indulge yourself and be gentle with your heart."
aquarius,2014-01-24,"Someone's great idea might catch your attention today, but think carefully before committing your energy and lending a helping hand. It might sound like an exciting project at first, but it could turn into more of a burden than you want to take on. However, if you reject a colleague's plan, spend extra time with that person explaining your decision, so he or she doesn't feel hurt by your refusal. A bit of diplomacy can fix a problem before it even manifests."
pisces,2014-01-24,"You are on quite a philosophical roll while the Moon zips through your 9th House of Big Ideas. Step back and take a long-term picture of your life so you can get a fresh view on what's currently happening. Look for any unhealthy patterns that you missed when you were too busy to notice them. For now, the lessons you learn along the way are more important than reaching your destination."
aries,2014-01-25,"Let your sensitivity guide your actions today because otherwise you could stir up trouble by riding roughshod over others. But you can overcome nearly anything that stands in your way now if you slow down and move along at a steady pace while being aware of resistance as it surfaces. Don't be afraid to retreat and reevaluate your strategy before trying to force your way past an insurmountable obstacle. Thankfully, there are many paths to success."
taurus,2014-01-25,"Your natural common sense tells you to think before you speak, but this inner voice might not be loud enough today. You may feel as if you are on the edge of something so big that you're tempted to blurt out your feelings. However, it's best to reconsider your message once more before saying a word. It's better to get it right the first time rather than having to start all over from scratch. Remember, it's not about being first. Do your homework to be fully prepared; accuracy is just as important as determination."
gemini,2014-01-25,"It feels as if even your best ideas can't gain traction now. Your ruling planet, cerebral Mercury, hits the wall of immovable Saturn today, possibly squelching your plans. Unfortunately, reality is trying to get an important message across to you. If you don't learn this lesson, the resistance may grow in strength until you have to deal with it at a later time. Paying careful attention to the signs enables you to gracefully handle this crisis and move on."
cancer,2014-01-25,"Your reactions could feel extreme today, yet you won't likely gain any advantage by withdrawing at the first sign of conflict. However, the real dilemma is that you may not score any points by confronting an issue directly. Don't waste your energy by engaging in a battle you cannot win. Your most sensible strategy is based upon persistence without aggression. There's no need to struggle; lead with your compassionate heart and the rest will fall into place."
leo,2014-01-25,"You may find yourself way out in front of the pack now, and someone may attempt to slow you down to get you back into the group. It really doesn't matter how idealistic your intentions are today; gently apply your own brakes before anyone else has to do it for you. A little self-restraint and a touch of humility can preemptively save the day."
virgo,2014-01-25,"A flood of great ideas can pull you all over the map today and you may be uncertain how to turn the best of them into tangible results. Don't push so hard if you encounter resistance; deciding your specific course of action is not a viable choice now. Instead, ride the intellectual currents and wait for the energy to settle down before making long-term plans."
libra,2014-01-25,"You may have to change your schedule against your better judgment, but a lack of flexibility on your part will only stir up even more trouble today. It's frustrating when others don't seem to understand your motives. On the other hand, your plan may not be as sound as you believe. Either way, a more objective approach could buy you the time you need in order to establish a more successful strategy."
scorpio,2014-01-25,"Some of the stress you now face stems from how you reacted to recent events. If you took advantage of a smart opportunity, you might not have to deal with any problems at all now. But you could have a tougher time making progress if you made a poor decision. Thankfully, letting go of your old expectations makes life easier to manage. Take advantage of the valuable lessons to be learned and move on."
sagittarius,2014-01-25,"Although a complicated event demands your attention today, you could still enjoy yourself more than you expect. In fact, you might be presented with a tricky situation that you will transform into a fabulous opportunity. However, you first need to live up to your current responsibilities before you magically turn a difficult situation into a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. Being a superhero takes hard work."
capricorn,2014-01-25,"Rewards may be waiting around the next corner if you successfully manage all the details and live up to your end of the bargain. Nevertheless, the clouds could still take another day or two to dissipate before blue sky becomes visible and you can get some clarity on what's happening. Meanwhile, don't fall behind in your work. The effort you put in over the next few days makes all the difference in the world."
aquarius,2014-01-25,"It's hard to keep your thoughts in line, even if you know what you should be thinking. Your lack of concentration may create problems and uncontrollable circumstances test your resolve. Although you might not have too much fun today, you'll feel a great deal of satisfaction later if you keep bringing your attention back to the work at hand and focus on the present moment the best you can. Sticking to your agenda sets you on the path to success."
pisces,2014-01-25,"If your dreams have grown out of proportion, someone unexpectedly may burst your bubble today. But, instead of quickly rejecting the feedback from others, take a chance to learn something that enables you to be more effective in reaching your goals. Of course, there is nothing wrong with a little fantasy, but now you must find an anchor to stabilize your life, and the advice you receive -- solicited or not -- can help."
aries,2014-01-26,"You might be whistling a happy tune this morning, but stress could have you singing the blues later in the day. Stick with a rational plan now because your feelings might mislead you, tempting you to ignore the problems you must face. Don't sidestep a serious issue by taking the easy way out. The power of positive thinking is extremely useful, but only to a point. Shutting out the truth won't resolve your anxiety about the future. Follow your logic without taking things too far."
taurus,2014-01-26,"You may profess your desire for love, but you might not be ready to follow up your words with whatever's necessary to create a lasting relationship. You want to look good in your partner's eyes and you could even be successful at magically pulling a rabbit out of a hat today. But it's not wise to push your luck, or you can find yourself overextended with no direct way home. Ironically, slowing down and taking a less flashy approach is a quicker route to intimacy."
gemini,2014-01-26,"A friend could act as a catalyst in your life today as he or she reminds you that you can do almost anything that you set your mind on. However, you might be tempted to downplay a professional opportunity by rushing into something completely different to avoid disappointing someone else. Acknowledge your strengths and weaknesses and remember that there's no need to make any excuses to justify your choices. Believing in yourself is the first step to success."
cancer,2014-01-26,"You may be more adventurous today, opening doors you might otherwise walk by without even stopping. At first, your excitement is empowering and you feel radiantly alive. But don't worry if you have second thoughts about your burst of bravado. Instead of suppressing your feelings, lean boldly into the unknown. Your uncertainty could transform into a beautiful agent for change if you just give it a chance."
leo,2014-01-26,"Easygoing play can suddenly turn serious today, but a simple mood change is not a good enough reason to pull away from someone you love. However, if you were previously too pushy, other significant issues come into view now, prompting you to shut down emotionally. Don't let your fears interfere with your plans. If you can remember to listen to your heart, there could be good news waiting at your doorstep when you return."
virgo,2014-01-26,"Your personal life has merged with your professional world, but you still may attempt to limit your energy to what's going on between you and a co-worker or friend. Your life might seem a touch out of control; everywhere you turn more information is streaming in and your senses are temporarily overwhelmed by the noise. Step back from all the commotion; reclaiming your objectivity now is a smart way to restore your vitality and reestablish harmony in your life."
libra,2014-01-26,"You're feeling quite animated today, especially if you enjoy what you are doing. Thankfully, you don't have to fake a good time since things are actually falling into place on their own. Nevertheless, you might be asked to expend a little extra effort to kick off something new. Luckily, you should be able to deliver the goods, so don't give up if you run into a problem. Persistence is your key now and its positive impact cannot be denied."
scorpio,2014-01-26,"Your window of opportunity may be closing soon, so don't waste any time today. Look into your recent past to see what you've already accomplished and make a list of everything that still needs to be done. Concentrate on finishing up as many old projects now as possible; don't wait for a better time because this might be your best shot. Take advantage of the cosmic energy while you have the planets working in your favor."
sagittarius,2014-01-26,"If someone asks you how you are doing today, you naturally want to tell your whole story. Although you may be the straightforward type, it's wise to remember that some things are best kept to yourself. Proceed with caution because your powers of discrimination are not very sharp now. You can't rely on your own judgment because your sense of proportion is temporarily bent out of shape. Say as little as possible until your clarity returns; it's better to be safe than sorry."
capricorn,2014-01-26,"You tend to oversimplify nearly everything today, and might even underestimate the time and money necessary to finish a long-term project. Nevertheless, it's crucial to set aside your logical reasons that have prevented you from completing a job. There's no need to fuss over a deadline that will likely be missed anyway. Making up lost time is easier than it sounds. The time for procrastination is over; just roll up your sleeves and get busy."
aquarius,2014-01-26,"Your horizons are widening now, allowing you to peer far into the future and giving you additional room to stretch your mind into many alternative scenarios. Nevertheless, this shift could leave you with a false sense of exhilaration. Tread carefully; it's challenging to get along without the support of your peers today. However, your own positive attitude makes the biggest difference, so remain as confident as you can while you continue to test your wings."
pisces,2014-01-26,"Your idealistic dreams about your career trajectory can be temporarily derailed today as someone directly questions your capabilities. Fortunately, you're wise enough to steer the conversation in the right direction. But you must be careful because your imagination may trick you into creating a plan so outrageous that it becomes unwieldy. Pay extra attention to the fine line that distinguishes reality from fantasy to achieve the best results."
aries,2014-01-27,"On the surface it seems as if everything is coming up roses today, but there is more going on than is apparent. It's great that you have so much happening within the realms of your imagination now. Your dreams are motivational, as long as you continue to clearly distinguish between reality and fantasy. Others see you as competent and they believe your actions are straightforward, but you may be more uncertain than anyone realizes. Acknowledge your true feelings, but don't let them impede your progress."
taurus,2014-01-27,"Although there may be a lot to finish at work today, you are determined to deliver on your promises. Push as hard as you can early in the day, since you might grow weary earlier than you expect. Fortunately, you're capable of handling everything that's thrown at you now, even if you inadvertently get involved in more than you should. But remember to take some time off once you complete your tasks; being extra nice to yourself this evening is a just reward for a job well done."
gemini,2014-01-27,"An angel may fly to your rescue today, whether you need the assistance or not. But in any case, accepting help is wise because it can deepen the bond of friendship. Don't worry if another person's involvement slightly reduces your efficiency. Ultimately, it's not about increasing your production now; it's about improving your relationships. Learning to graciously receive is a gift in itself."
cancer,2014-01-27,"Performing your job well feels exceptionally satisfying today. You don't even need acknowledgment from others; the fruit of your labor is reward enough for you now. Nevertheless, fulfillment may be elusive if you think that you should be pursuing a different line of work. Fortunately, opportunities are lurking right in front of your nose, and if you are clever enough you could turn one of them into a new direction in your current career."
leo,2014-01-27,"Although you could sail through the day with a smile on your face, it's more productive to channel your positive attitude into a creative endeavor. Either way, it's an uplifting time, but you might as well have something to show off when all is said and done. However, don't isolate yourself from everyone else; collaborating with others now can open doors to a colorful new world."
virgo,2014-01-27,"You can't approach your work in the same manner as you did last week because something has changed and the old methods are not as effective anymore. Thankfully, you could become inspired and invent an entirely new and original way of doing your job. Don't worry if your idea is the best one or not. For now, just trying something different may be enough to break the ice and stir the energy in a positive direction."
libra,2014-01-27,"You might experience an exciting burst of energy today, but you have to take a risk in order to make the most of it. It's crucial to keep yourself motivated, for if you become lazy, you could miss a significant opportunity. Forget about taking the tried and true path to success now. Carpediem; if you want to accomplish anything extraordinary, you must set your comfort aside, step out of the box and do something you've never done before."
scorpio,2014-01-27,"This could be a much better day than you anticipate as something especially nice comes your way. Of course, any unexpected pleasant experience would be welcome, but finding a bargain, receiving a cash windfall or making a new friend positively impacts your life. However, you must be in a receptive frame of mind now or the good news might pass you by unnoticed. Adopting a grateful attitude invites more blessings into your world."
sagittarius,2014-01-27,"Your life is overflowing with an array of wonderful possibilities now. However, your excitement won't automatically manifest tangible results unless you set the stage for their expression by establishing goals and working hard to achieve them. Your acts of generosity will be returned, but probably not quite as you expect. Demonstrate your strength of character by being open to change."
capricorn,2014-01-27,"You woke up with a happy song in your head today, but oddly enough it's challenging to put your finger on the source of your optimism. It's as if you know something awesome is going to happen, but you don't know what it is or why you are so sure of it. Don't waste a lot of time trying to deconstruct your instincts now; instead, just act as if your hunch is correct and keep singing. Your faith may be enough to alter your future in a positive manner."
aquarius,2014-01-27,"Your social calendar might light up today, since the Moon is now visiting your 11th House of Friends and Community. Although the Moon's journey doesn't actually increase your popularity, you don't have to try so hard to be included in every fun activity. You could exude more charisma than you realize now and your assertive style might even seem aggressive unless you consciously tone down your approach. Enjoy the camaraderie but be sure to share the spotlight to keep everyone happy."
pisces,2014-01-27,"Your outward behavior doesn't tell the whole story now, since your actions seem to be all about your career. Nevertheless, the winds of fate are blowing in unusual directions and they can carry you toward an unexpected destination. Fortunately, the outcome is likely to be better than you think, so don't bother to resist the shifting currents. Keep your spirits up even if you're heading into unknown territory; your thoughts are creating your tomorrow before it arrives."
aries,2014-01-28,"Expressing your best intentions might lead you down a dead-end street today. Unfortunately, you are not free to do as you please just because you mean well. Reprioritize your responsibilities and plan your day accordingly. You can still find time to enjoy yourself, but you'll feel better about squeezing in some fun if you don't have to worry about what you should have done earlier."
taurus,2014-01-28,"Even your boss might not be able to change your mind today, no matter how much he or she tries. Unfortunately, neither cool logic nor an emotional appeal seems to work. Ultimately, the choice is yours; nevertheless, it's wiser to remain open to fresh input from someone who is an authority on the subject. Remember, you may have a great strategy in place, but there are still those who know more than you. Keep an open mind and a receptive heart."
gemini,2014-01-28,"Although you probably want to do your own thing today, you still wish you could meet other people's expectations, too. However, your natural tendency to remain uncommitted gives way to a more immediate need to be practical now. Don't waste precious energy fighting about the wrong issues. Think about the amount of effort you want to devote to a potential conflict and then do what makes the most sense in the immediate moment."
cancer,2014-01-28,"All types of relationships are emphasized today as the Moon shifts into your 7th House of Partners, reflecting the feelings of those closest to you. Instead of responding to the current situation based upon your own needs, you must also consider what others want. Unfortunately, it can be a struggle to integrate someone else's point of view into your perspective now. Nevertheless, compromise is still a smarter alternative to acting on your own."
leo,2014-01-28,"You know exactly what must be accomplished today, even if it seems overwhelming at first. Your original plans may be quite different from what actually needs to happen, but avoiding your responsibilities isn't a smart idea. Keep in mind that you still have to meet your commitments sooner or later. You can enjoy yourself more if you get them out of the way earlier in the day. Work now, play later."
virgo,2014-01-28,"Your approach to your job isn't based only on effectiveness and efficiency today. Instead, you're also likely to consider what brings you joy. Ironically, taking yourself too seriously now can actually be counterproductive. Although you're often willing to narrow your focus and complete the tasks at hand, you might actually be more productive now if you are having fun."
libra,2014-01-28,"Taking care of your personal needs might require a lot of your time today and could interfere with your previous commitments. Unfortunately, you may not be able to get out of fulfilling your obligations, and it isn't worth turning your current resistance into a major conflict. Instead of burying your desire to have a good time, just postpone the fun and games until you have demonstrated your willingness to be responsible."
scorpio,2014-01-28,"Your hectic schedule might not leave a lot of room for idle daydreaming today. Although you prefer having unstructured time by yourself for contemplation, you're more likely to be pulled into a series of intense interactions that ultimately define your day. It may feel like you have a difficult path ahead, but there's also a lot of good that could come out of processing your emotions through constructive dialogue. The give and take of conversation sets the stage for positive transformation."
sagittarius,2014-01-28,"You may choose to stand up to a bully at work today because you are sure of your plan, even if it's contrary to the general consensus. Your associates might be satisfied with finding the easiest way out, but you could be quite obstinate now in your intention to value truth over convenience. Although your idealism is admirable, you can easily take it too far. There's no need to be so self-righteous that you can't see the acceptable common ground you're already standing upon."
capricorn,2014-01-28,You could get so carried away with your own ambitions now that you lose track of the most practical path and end up making a wrong turn. The Moon's current visit to your hardworking sign can turn a simple task into a major project today before you even realize what happened. Don't set goals that are so lofty they're unreachable. Maintaining a sensible approach to your job is possible if you focus on the task at hand instead of the final destination.
aquarius,2014-01-28,"Sometimes your fantasies are like scenes out of a science fiction movie and seem to have little basis in reality. Now, however, your dreams can hold the key to your immediate future because your imagination is being fed directly by your everyday experiences. Don't try to rein in your thoughts; patiently let them wander as they will. Paying attention to the messages from your subconscious just might lead you to a wonderfully useful treasure."
pisces,2014-01-28,"You might be so positive about what comes next that you find yourself defending your plans against someone at work today. It may feel as if others are being overly aggressive, but it's more likely that you don't want to face any negativity at all. Don't avoid the facts just because it makes sticking to your strategy easier to justify. It's crucial to acknowledge any errors in judgment as soon as possible any apologize if necessary. If you have missed something important, modify your strategy and get back to work."
aries,2014-01-29,"It seems as if extra effort in the workplace should pay off, but lingering resistance might impede your progress. You may be harboring resentment about your responsibilities, but resisting the inevitable now is not going to land you anywhere but in trouble. Use your intellect and convert your anger into production, regardless of your feelings. You'll soon look back on today with pride in your persistence and a sense of accomplishment."
taurus,2014-01-29,"Your anticipation is spreading like a field of dandelions on a fertile spring lawn. Unfortunately, it might not feel like you have any way of gaining control over the situation unless you take an extreme approach and bury your emotions as deeply as you can. However, denial is not a good idea because your thoughts will pop up again faster than you expect. Don't try to suppress your temporary anxiety. Instead, go to the source of the problem and make changes where they can take root."
gemini,2014-01-29,"You might want to hold back your original ideas now because you believe that others aren't playing with the right attitude. You can sense that something is wrong, but there's not much you can do about it except honor your own end of the deal. Don't give anyone a reason to question your motives. Smile and whistle while you work. Let your deeds speak volumes for you today and steer clear of any unnecessary drama."
cancer,2014-01-29,"You bring a fresh perspective to your job today, and your unorthodox approach may untangle a difficult situation that has been bothering you for a while. Don't be afraid to take a calculated risk now, since you have a healthy balance between your intuition and your common sense. There might not be a better day than this one to initiate the exciting changes you've been dreaming about. Make your move while the window of opportunity is still wide open."
leo,2014-01-29,"You think that you can relax a bit now and maybe even play hooky, but your responsibilities might not give you this kind of latitude. There's just too much on your plate today and you're going to need to do your part at work before you sneak off to enjoy some free time. It's difficult to juggle everything, but you can keep the most important projects in motion if you simply prioritize your tasks."
virgo,2014-01-29,"If you have taken care of business over the last few weeks, you may be counting your lucky stars today. On the other hand, everything might fall apart if you have been slacking off from your responsibilities. Even if there's no quick fix for what you should have already done, you still could have a trick or two up your sleeve. Don't wait for a better time; this is as good a moment as any to make some magic."
libra,2014-01-29,"Whether it is your lack of self-esteem that holds you back or growing responsibilities that keep you from fulfilling your promises, you could feel caught in a net with no easy escape route. Your mind is running incessantly as you try to find a way out of the predicament, but your own wheels keep getting in the way. Don't struggle so hard and the solution may come to you in a sudden flash of inspiration."
scorpio,2014-01-29,"You have a gnawing urge to spill the beans today. Although you may think that sharing everything is a good idea, it could be problematic if you're not willing to deal with the consequences of your disclosure. Currently, exercising discretion serves you better than uncensored impulsive outbursts. There's no need to tell tall tales; it's probably wiser to leave some of the details out of the story for now."
sagittarius,2014-01-29,"You could run into a minor financial setback today, but it might ultimately work out to your advantage in the long run. It may be as small as being overcharged a few cents at the market. But it can be more significant, like finding yourself short of cash with others relying on you to cover the tab. Pay close attention to all monetary transactions now, regardless of how this energy plays out in your life. Taking time to reassess your resources is never a bad idea."
capricorn,2014-01-29,"You're experiencing agitation because you don't want to deal with your emotions, but you must face the music now that the reflective Moon is rattling your 1st House of Self. Your first inclination might be to take your current desire to rebel out on someone else who doesn't deserve it. Even if being radically honest seems like the right thing to do today, don't do it. Assuming full responsibility for your feelings is your best bet. Being honest from the start is much simpler than dealing with the resistance you will receive if you shift the blame to others."
aquarius,2014-01-29,"You're feeling the temptation to quit fighting for your beliefs today. You're tired of all the drama and can't help but dream of running away. However, it's smarter to call on your inner strength and listen to your intuition instead. Remember, the largest obstacle facing you now is your own self-doubt. Unfortunately, enemies seem real, even if they are just windmills spinning in the breeze. Change your outer world by changing your attitude first. Lasting transformation starts from within."
pisces,2014-01-29,"Knowing when to quit isn't an easy task for you big-hearted Pisces. Although you can be fiercely loyal to a cause, you're not one to go down fighting a losing battle today. However, you still might have trouble letting go at the last moment. The smallest glimmer of hope leads you into believing the clouds will clear and the sun will shine. It may not be as clean a victory as you want, but you could still surprise everyone with your brilliant tactics. Your unwavering faith stirs up a powerful magic of its own."
aries,2014-01-30,"Your future is looking up as the spark of excitement returns today, but your current enthusiasm may carry you too far. Anyone who comes to you with schemes for world domination should wear yellow warning flags because the Aquarius New Moon can overstimulate your 11th House of Hopes and Dreams. Remember things appear bigger and better than they seem. Keep the optimism flowing, but proceed with caution."
taurus,2014-01-30,You may be experiencing stress as different parts of your life present you with conflicting agendas today. It's important that you do the best you can to honor the complexity. Don't over-commit in your personal world just because you feel guilty about your time away from your home and family. The good news is that the Aquarius New Moon activates your 10th House of Career Objectives; projects started at work now might bring nearly immediate rewards in the days ahead.
gemini,2014-01-30,"It may be tough to finish everything on your plate because your intentions are aimed at a distant horizon. You feel as if you can change things which are usually beyond your grasp now that the Aquarius New Moon buzzes your 9th House of Adventure. It's okay if your reach extends past your usual boundaries today, but be careful about grasping for the stars. Your positive attitude doesn't guarantee your success but it's still worth the effort. Ultimately, accomplishing your goal is less important than the lessons you learn every step along the way."
cancer,2014-01-30,"You could have highly unusual ideas about how to best work with others today. It seems that you need assistance in your current project, but it isn't merely about physical labor or analytical research. Instead, consider all the skills, tools or resources your allies have to bring to the table. The Aquarius New Moon falling in your 8th House of Deep Sharing reminds you to be open to whatever comes your way. Success may be closer than you think if everyone has the same goal in mind."
leo,2014-01-30,"You can't help but attract unusual people with today's unpredictable Aquarius New Moon occurring in your 7th House of Relationships. Your romantic feelings can make the situation more complicated, but ultimately this may not be about lasting love. Be spontaneous and let the feelings flow without restraint or expectations. Be bold and creative in order to get the most joy from your current partnerships."
virgo,2014-01-30,"It is time to set your ducks in a row, sort your recipe cards into alphabetical order and carefully match all your socks. Basically, you get to be as weird as you wish now when indulging in your organizational kinkiness. This is not for public consumption. It's for your benefit only. Whatever little idiosyncrasy helps you to be more productive in the long run is worth the effort today. Honor what makes you unique as it is an integral part of what makes you shine."
libra,2014-01-30,"Find something totally different to do now -- an intriguing activity that sets the tone for the days ahead. For example, if you've been thinking about enrolling in an art class or attending a live concert, invite a friend to join you and make it happen. It's time to broadcast your creative, fun-loving side whether by phone, email or in person. Partaking in a spontaneous adventure today will inspire you to explore even further later on."
scorpio,2014-01-30,You might prefer to stay at home and attend to your own needs today but your social obligations won't allow it. You dream of taking shelter from the noise of the outer world now that the Aquarius New Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Security. Don't worry if you feel shortchanged in the department of rest and relaxation; you will have time for a full retreat soon enough. In the meantime sneak away and steal a few moments for yourself as circumstances permit.
sagittarius,2014-01-30,"The pace of your day grows more hectic as your calendar fills up and the overall complexity of life increases. However, the Aquarius New Moon in your 3rd House of Information reminds you that the details will come back to haunt you later on if you ignore them today. Your inclination may be to let the little things slide in favor of the larger picture, but there is much to gain now by bouncing back and forth between the big and the little."
capricorn,2014-01-30,"Your personal finances are suddenly moved to the front burner and will continue to simmer for the next couple of weeks. Perhaps today's Aquarius New Moon falling in your 2nd House of Money adds uncertainty to your cash flow, or maybe you are simply reconsidering a realignment of some of your material resources. Don't try to fix everything all in one day. Make a plan to use the days ahead wisely in order to bring you closer to your fiscal goals."
aquarius,2014-01-30,"The intuitive flashes now coming your way might put you in touch with non-physical dimensions of the spiritual world. This isn't all fun and games, for integrating your visions with your intellect may require some complicated work. Meanwhile, this New Moon in your unconventional sign could have you chanting spells like a wizard. Don't be overly concerned if others think you are losing it. You will return to reality wiser for your journey after your magical mystery tour is over."
pisces,2014-01-30,"Your colorful dreams may seem quite vivid and real now -- so real, in fact, they spill over into your waking life. Today's Aquarius New Moon hums in your 12th House of Spirituality, amplifying your fantasies, even if they are not clearly defined. Make the time to settle into your imagination and explore the possibilities. Within the quietness of contemplation is a deep power that helps you to realize your full potential."
aries,2014-01-31,"There is no need to stress about whether or not you are appreciated by your peers. If you have been meeting your obligations without stirring up too much trouble, then you will likely receive accolades for your efforts. But don't obsess about being noticed because your desire for immediate recognition could spoil your success before it arrives. Just keep up the good work without engaging in any attention-seeking behavior; your contribution will be acknowledged sooner than you think."
taurus,2014-01-31,"Your drive to step beyond preexisting boundaries continues to motivate your current choices. However, there's no guarantee that impulsive behavior will pay off. To the contrary, it's accomplishing the long-term goals that should be in the spotlight now because this can bring you the most happiness. Don't succumb to the temptation of shortcuts. Your most reliable strategy today is to stick to the tried and true when it comes to your future."
gemini,2014-01-31,"Make a commitment to explore the intensity of your shadows; it's the uncomfortable places within your mind that could offer the most growth now. Given the choice, you often steer clear of the darkness, yet there is a powerful attraction drawing you into your subconscious today. Courage is the key; remember, you will be changed by what you discover. This journey into the unknown can transform your fear into love."
cancer,2014-01-31,"Acknowledging the expectations that others place upon you raises old relationship issues, tempting you to escape from the jaws of commitment. Unfortunately, you might not be in a position to sidestep the promises you made. Thankfully, the tide is turning; if you honor your obligations with a positive attitude, love just might be closer than you think. Don't let your past define your future."
leo,2014-01-31,"Although you might feel a sense of urgency to resolve a conflict with a coworker, it's smarter to let the dynamics play out naturally. Fortunately, you can minimize the pressure by remembering that the current deadlines are arbitrary. Even if your nerves are frayed, the energy will calm down if you fill your day with productive activities. Focusing on the details won't fix any underlying issues, but it improves your chances of enjoying yourself over the weekend."
virgo,2014-01-31,"Whoever says that you can't loosen up is missing an important part of your natural expression. While it's true that many Virgos have difficulty pretending that they are having fun if they're not, you do know how to kick up your heels when the opportunity arises. Over the days ahead, take a chance and demonstrate another side of your personality; impress others with your spontaneity and charm."
libra,2014-01-31,"Family obligations seem to be your top priority these days, perhaps even to the extent of avoiding the work that's expected of you now. Thankfully, you can clearly see the light at the end of the tunnel, motivating you to follow through on your promises. Your willingness to jump in without reserve enables you to get results faster than you expect. More than anything, you want peace at home and this is your chance to make it happen."
scorpio,2014-01-31,Your interest in your immediate surroundings continues to grow. Perhaps you have already invested in household items that increase your comfort and beautify your environment. Now it's time to take the pleasure principle to the next level; give yourself permission to further indulge your senses while the cosmic energies are cheering you on. Taking care of yourself empowers you to make other positive changes in your life.
sagittarius,2014-01-31,"Although you Archers aren't typically known for having issues with low self-esteem, sometimes you still face the same insecurities as everyone else. If you have struggled with your self-worth recently, it's time to complete your process of transformation now so you can get on with your life. Undervaluing your contribution to others limits your development. Take a realistic look at what you do best and focus on that for the next few weeks."
capricorn,2014-01-31,"It's time to step out from the shadows and let your love light shine now that Venus is turning direct in Capricorn. Thankfully, the Goddess of Love brings the sweet pleasures that were denied or delayed while she was retrograde in your sign over the last six weeks. Review your recent experiences to see what you can learn from them. But don't linger in the past; follow your heart's desire as it reveals the numerous possibilities ahead."
aquarius,2014-01-31,"You might not be able to clearly express what you want with sensual Venus hanging out in your 12th House of Secrets. However, now that the planet of love turns direct, you may begin to feel the urge to open your heart wide enough to share some previously hidden desires. Don't rush the process; giving yourself enough time to get comfortable with your disclosures increases the likelihood of your message being well received."
pisces,2014-01-31,"You are being shown again and again how important your friends are now and you really appreciate their unwavering presence in your life. However, if you're seeking new connections, it's a great time to reach out and make overtures to others to build a network of support. Remember, being friendly is a conscious choice. Going out of your way to create community continues to bring blessings in the weeks ahead."
aries,2014-02-01,"Your future plans may seem a bit shaky today, especially if you try to maintain a rational outlook on your life. The bottom line is that you cannot logically think your way out of a current dilemma. You are better off now by completely giving yourself up to the magic of the moment. Let your intuition guide you through any emotional resistance you might encounter along the way."
taurus,2014-02-01,"Your social life may be on the upswing now since your long-term goals are being supported by your friends. Still, there might be an awkward misunderstanding today that can muddy an otherwise pleasant situation. Take time to clarify the facts before you assume more than you know. It's easier to get the real story right from the beginning rather than cleaning up a confusing mess later on. Your no-nonsense approach is appreciated by everyone involved."
gemini,2014-02-01,"You may enjoy playing the role of detective today by asking questions to dig up missing information. However, you might run into problems now if the new facts don't jive with what you already know. Don't fall into the trap of trying to make everything fit neatly into place. Be content living with an unsolved mystery for a while longer. Remember, powerful magic can occur outside the constraints of reality if you open your mind to all the amazing possibilities."
cancer,2014-02-01,"Relying on someone else's stability might be a familiar strategy, but don't lean so hard that you become unbalanced now. Maintaining your center of gravity is critical today, especially since others may not be one hundred percent infallible. Still, they can offer you a much-needed anchor at a time when you could otherwise drift aimlessly in the changing currents. Being thankful for the supportive people in your life is great, but expressing your gratitude to them is even better."
leo,2014-02-01,"In order to explore the various possibilities of where your current feelings are taking you requires you to keep an open heart and mind. As tempting as it may be to have a judgmental attitude, narrow-minded thinking is not of value to you now because you could get caught up in endless logistics that don't lead anywhere productive. Set aside your old rules and unhealthy limits so your emotions can flow away from fear and toward love."
virgo,2014-02-01,"Although you may choose to tackle a nagging relationship problem today, you could become so focused that you can't see the forest for the trees. You efficient Virgos often need to fight against a natural tendency toward seeking too much information. Now, your ability to expand your thinking will help you overcome your sometimes too-serious attitude. Keep in mind that you can lighten up without necessarily ignoring what's important. Sometimes a touch of humor is all you need to break the ice."
libra,2014-02-01,"Although you might be in a very pragmatic frame of mind today, something unexpected could happen that seems out of your control. Even if you feel as if you're in the hands of fate, remember that your attitude can still alter the path ahead. Don't rely on your intuition now because your strong desires may lead you astray. Your destiny is in your hands; visualizing the best possible outcome is your first step to reclaiming your power."
scorpio,2014-02-01,"Your optimism rises to the surface today as your goals become more clearly defined. You might even derive pleasure from sharing the fascinating possibilities you see in front of you. However, remember that your imagination may be running wild, so don't finalize any plans until you have completed your fact-finding mission. There's a lot to be gained now by indulging your dreams and simply enjoying the ride."
sagittarius,2014-02-01,"Although you may have unfinished chores to do at home, you could benefit from a short spiritual retreat now. However, if it's not possible to get away for a day to commune with nature or connect with your higher self, at least try to listen to a guided meditation or enroll in a class that speaks to your heart. One way or another, make a commitment today to learn something of lasting value. Energy flows where attention goes."
capricorn,2014-02-01,"You could build a strong case for your new plan now so don't be afraid to ask someone to work with you. There's no need to wait for everything to be perfectly in place. Nevertheless, be as logical and methodical in all your communications as possible. Don't take the easy way out by settling for any less than one hundred percent of what you can accomplish. Luckily, your passionate confidence and proven competence encourage others to join in your parade."
aquarius,2014-02-01,"You may feel as if your love life has been placed on the back burner, but don't waste any energy worrying about it in the present moment. You can enrich your day by considering more spiritual aspects of the heart, instead of just focusing all of your attention on romance. Lift your self-esteem by shifting your approach to one of compassionate service. Caring about the needs of others is like a tonic for your soul."
pisces,2014-02-01,"Although your moods are swinging back and forth like a pendulum today, the shifting tides grow easier to navigate. Nevertheless, you're still highly emotional now that the evocative Moon is traveling through your intuitive sign. After demonstrating that you can handle a wild ride with the best of them, your friends and associates are more than willing to accept you as you are. Practice being an observer by watching how the interpersonal dynamics evolve. You're ready to learn an important lesson about your heart."
aries,2014-02-02,"Your smartest strategy may be to temporarily walk away from any conflicts that might develop today, since fighting back won't be as effective as you wish. You could waste valuable energy by going into defensive mode when it isn't even necessary. Instead of lingering in negativity, your time would be better spent connecting with your higher self. Attend a yoga class, take a walk outside or meditate to your favorite music to make the most of the day."
taurus,2014-02-02,"You might feel as if you're being swept along with the rest of the group now, but your heart may not be in it. You have been on the fence for a while and today you learn new reasons not to blindly follow others. Pay attention to your needs, especially if you feel frustrated. Don't surrender to peer pressure; your determination will ultimately work in your favor."
gemini,2014-02-02,"People are depending on you today to share your knowledge, but you might not be willing to put out the extra energy required. Your temporary lack of interest may be upsetting to your friends, but you're not particularly concerned with their annoyance. Don't be too cavalier with your nonchalant attitude. Find a way to get involved without over-committing your resources; your enthusiasm for helping others will return soon enough."
cancer,2014-02-02,"Passive-aggressive behavior isn't usually your best path to success; however, it can work effectively for you today. Consider your options carefully, decide what you want and then hold on to it with all your might. Give others enough time to come around to your point of view, even if it takes a day or two. Just remember, people are likely to be more cooperative if you include them in your decision-making process in the first place."
leo,2014-02-02,"Taking a step back is wise if you feel unable to communicate your needs today. However, your secretive behavior may mean that things won't go your way, but this isn't the end of the world; it's just one minor disappointment. Sidestep any emotional blowups that might be brewing, for it isn't productive now to lose your temper. Instead, find a way to demonstrate your vulnerability without being so dramatic. Share your perspective without expecting anything in return."
virgo,2014-02-02,"It may feel as if you can't win in a current relationship struggle. However, neither one of you will come out on top unless you get a more realistic grip on the situation. Thankfully, the disagreement isn't quite as important as you think, so let go of your attachment to the outcome. Fortunately, you can go directly to the source of wisdom by trusting your instincts to tell you the truth."
libra,2014-02-02,"Your daily routine might be interrupted by an intense emotional drama on the home front. No matter how hard you try to avoid the detour, you will still be lured down the rabbit hole where, at best, it's tricky to tell what's really happening. Forget about making sense of the current dynamics; a totally irrational experience can be exhilarating if you don't get hung up on being too serious. Bring your sense of humor along for the ride."
scorpio,2014-02-02,"Your anger is agitated, then soothed and then stirred up again today as the changing emotional landscape forces you to respond, even if you aren't committed to your current feelings. This crazy roller coaster ride settles down over the days ahead, but you might find it difficult to sit patiently. Any sort of physical exercise is helpful now, because it blows off some of your frustration before it builds to a critical mass. It's better to manage your emotions when they first surface, rather than waiting until it's too late."
sagittarius,2014-02-02,"A power struggle can be scary today as you try to release old patterns and react in a healthier way. It's challenging to let go of the most familiar routines -- even if they don't work to your advantage. Don't back away from a potential conflict now, but resist playing your holier-than-thou card, for any attempts to display self-righteousness will only offend those who are already on your side. Express yourself authentically, but remember there are many acceptable points of view to take into consideration."
capricorn,2014-02-02,"Communication could grow a bit chaotic today, yet it's crucial that you don't withdraw or shut down to avoid the noise. Your current tendency is to steer clear of a sticky situation, but denial certainly won't solve your dilemma. Lean into the resistance like a ship's sails lean into the breeze. It doesn't matter which way the wind is blowing now, even if the turbulence is coming from within yourself. Your willingness to show up and do the work is what really matters."
aquarius,2014-02-02,"Your finances may need a bit of untangling now, even if you thought that you had clarity about your current fiscal position. Thankfully, you should be able to tighten things up without too much effort. Eliminate unnecessary purchases and reduce the complexity before starting a new project or embarking on an adventure. The real key to finding security is getting back to basics."
pisces,2014-02-02,"If you haven't recently made significant improvements in your life, you might feel as if you're running out of time. Of course, it's never untimely to initiate positive change, but you may be better off now delaying action until after the evocative Moon enters enterprising Aries later tonight, giving you the additional energy you need. Waiting for the best moment to act plays a big role in your future success. Timing is everything."
aries,2014-02-03,"Your energy runs hot and cold today, making it tricky to choose your direction. One minute the adrenaline is flowing and you are full of excitement, ready to take on the world. But the next minute you feel like curling up and taking a nap. Carefully monitor your vitality so you don't run out of gas before the day is over. Be sensible and don't push too hard without considering your limitations. After all, you're still human like everyone else."
taurus,2014-02-03,"You may be responsible for a task that makes you feel uncomfortable today. Keeping an open mind is required to overcome your current resistance to change; there is much to be gained by thinking outside of the box. The craziest ideas are the ones that might be the most effective now. Whatever worked in the past won't necessarily work in the present, so find ways to let go of old habits and move yourself into the future. Embrace the unknown."
gemini,2014-02-03,"Slow down, take a long deep breath and let your body catch up with your mind. Your brain is buzzing with brilliance now; however, maintaining balance in the midst of all this excitement is essential today. However, without a stable foundation, the insights you have could fly away with the breeze. Luckily, staying calm enables you to put your intelligence to good use."
cancer,2014-02-03,"Open your heart and expand your mind to accept the inspirational messages that are now available to you. Granted, you may find some of these new ideas to be rather unconventional. However, your current experiences could help you reach your destination, even if they don't lead you to the answers you're seeking. A little flexibility goes a long way when it comes to planning your future."
leo,2014-02-03,"Partnership matters may be confusing today because your feelings are all over the place. People appear and disappear suddenly now, and plans must be altered without notice. Opportunities arise one minute only to crumble in the chaos moments later. Thankfully, this can be a wildly exciting day if you appreciate the element of surprise. Go with the flow instead of attempting to run the show."
virgo,2014-02-03,"You might want to experiment with a new approach when working with others, since sticking to an old formula is not necessarily the most successful strategy. There are alternative methods which would allow you to accomplish more in less time with less effort. Treat this experience as a learning challenge which can stimulate your thinking and increase your productivity. Making the transition may slow you down at first, but the changes will pay off in the long run."
libra,2014-02-03,"Relationships may seem unstable today, especially if someone isn't playing by your rules. However, upon closer examination, another person's erratic behavior might actually be acting out emotions that you are suppressing within yourself. Instead of questioning what others want, explore your unexpressed desires for a while. Let your fantasies flow freely now before deciding how to follow up on the most meaningful ones. Remember, no one can take your feelings away from you, whether you verbalize them or not."
scorpio,2014-02-03,"Your passions can rise and fall with unexpected suddenness today, stirring up rough waters. Although you might be tempted to fight against the changing tides, don't try so hard that you wind up frustrated. Unfortunately, you cannot manage the process; it's a wild ride that requires a light touch and unwavering courage. Take advantage of these turbulent times by surfing the wave of change to see where the currents carry you. Letting go of control could be more fun than you expect."
sagittarius,2014-02-03,"You don't have to travel too far to discover the answers to big life questions today. The best advice you receive are the most down-to-earth responses. Simple solutions arise to what you perceive as complex problems. Sometimes you seek out more information than you need, but the most direct route is likely to be the best one now. Funny enough, the knowledge you seek may be found within."
capricorn,2014-02-03,"Taking a financial risk isn't your regular style, since you're generally very practical about spending your hard-earned resources. Typically, you do copious research before shelling out large amounts of money for anything, but you might sidestep this safe strategy today. Of course, reckless behavior can get you into trouble, yet giving yourself permission to be a little more spontaneous now and again could work in your favor. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
aquarius,2014-02-03,"You are here to shake up the world today and even if that's not your original intent, people may respond as if you've shocked them with a live wire. However, it's in your best interest to act cautiously and carefully when involving others in your process if you really want to manifest lasting change. Paradoxically, a more methodical approach brings faster results. Rome wasn't built in a day."
pisces,2014-02-03,"Someone can catch you off guard by surprising you with an unexpected gesture today. Although he or she might act as if it's just a game, their intentions may be less friendly than you think. Taking advantage of you is certainly not a great way to build trust. Remember, you are not obligated to play with anyone who isn't playing nicely. Don't be afraid to set clear boundaries; a little privacy could be exactly what you need right now."
aries,2014-02-04,"You are driven by your irrepressible emotions today, yet you can easily get in your own way if you push too hard. Reality is trying to tell you something now, but it may be nearly impossible to decipher the message. Observe the dynamics of this ongoing dance; if your efforts meet resistance, don't waste too much energy trying to overpower the obstacles. Instead, go to the source of your feelings; you should start to make progress again once you take the time to figure out what you really want."
taurus,2014-02-04,"A recent change of plans might be a bit unnerving since you often prefer the comfort of the status quo over the uncertainty of the unknown. Circumstances have quieted down enough now for you to look at where you are going and to decide whether or not you really want to head off in this direction. Reassess your long-term goals, but allow current events to pull you back into present time where you are needed. Acting in a responsible manner doesn't need to prevent you from dreaming about the future."
gemini,2014-02-04,"You're ready to take a major step forward in your current effort to catch up on backlogged communication. However, you could run into trouble immediately if reality has a different idea about how you should spend your day. The tricky part is that you may not have enough time to avoid what's coming your way, for the incoming curve balls are so unexpected. Thankfully, letting go of control at just the right moment makes life more enjoyable now. You can always return to your previous plans later in the week."
cancer,2014-02-04,"You want to believe that it's sufficient to just change your attitude and circumstances will respond accordingly, especially if you need some recovery time from a recent clash with reality. Going home, getting cozy and curling up with a good book and a cup of tea sounds like a perfect solution to all that ails you today. Nevertheless, you must take care of business first if others are depending on you. Balancing inner and outer needs makes the most sense in the long run."
leo,2014-02-04,"You are all fired up and it's challenging to talk yourself down from the ledge of enthusiasm today. Unfortunately, everything could grow more complicated than you wish, especially if you overlook a minor detail that comes back to haunt you. Or maybe someone is resisting your plans now, even if they won't tell you directly. Address any issues that surface since they will only get harder to resolve as the days go by. Slow down and get things right so you don't have to redo them later on."
virgo,2014-02-04,"Your sense of enthusiasm is often powered by your highly functioning analytical mind, which can see every little flaw, no matter how tiny it may be now. Others might be overwhelmed by so many details, but your brain is built for this type of situation. This is your chance to shine; let your associates lean on you for your expertise. Tell yourself that you are up for any challenge today. You can always rest in a day or two after your work is done."
libra,2014-02-04,"No matter how hard you try, it still may be tricky to find a point of balance today. Intellectually, you know what you must do and you're eager to head off in that direction. But others might believe that you should be embarking on a completely different path. Although you would like to take every point of view into account, it's simply impossible to do so. Instead, be as considerate as possible to all involved. Nevertheless, if you cannot please everyone, at least be true to yourself."
scorpio,2014-02-04,"Life might be easier sometimes if only you could turn off your intense emotions and your incisive powers of perception. But, of course, you can't. Anyway, it wouldn't be like you to just gloss over the hidden reality of a situation, even if people around you find it difficult to face the gory details. Thankfully, you don't have to pretend to live up to anyone else's expectations if you set clear boundaries today. It's easier to honor your emotions if you create enough room to contain them when they become too extreme for others to handle."
sagittarius,2014-02-04,"Staying on the sunny side of the street is difficult today if your plans run into resistance from others. Unfortunately, no matter how much you focus on your own intentions now, other people may still rain on your parade. Nevertheless, don't waste energy trying to outrun an emotional storm or to push away the clouds of doubt. The current turmoil won't last, but, thankfully, your faith will."
capricorn,2014-02-04,"You are truly amazing to watch once you make up your mind to overcome a particular obstacle. When others feel the pressure of circumstances building, they might collapse under the weight of responsibility. However, you Goats love to strategize how to use the current events as opportunities to improve your situation. Even if there are some minor speed bumps in the road now, this is an advantageous time to apply yourself diligently toward reaching your goals."
aquarius,2014-02-04,"There is an uneven progression to your accomplishments today. You might even get yourself all worked up now, only to initiate action and then discover that you wasted precious time running off in the wrong direction. Luckily, you can be very productive if you delay your response in order to avoid making too many false starts. Take a deep breath and visualize crossing the finish line; slow and steady wins the race."
pisces,2014-02-04,"You may intuitively sense that big changes are moving slowly toward you. In the meantime, you have plenty to do to fend off more immediate opposition. The problem is that it's difficult to find the real source of the blockages you now face. Even if the resistance is a direct manifestation of your own imagination, it can still be discouraging. Don't give up until you accomplish what you set out to do. Your success depends upon your unwavering belief in yourself."
aries,2014-02-05,"Although you wish your life was less complicated today, you might have more work to do before you can separate yourself from the noise you have created. Your path may seem clear now, but it still could take quite a bit of determination on your part to reach your destination. Be careful not to slip into denial and fall back into complacency. There are changes that need to be made, so don't give up the good fight. Your passionate persistence is your secret weapon."
taurus,2014-02-05,"No matter how much you might want to focus on your feelings, it's challenging to stop your mind from spinning around in circles today. You are thinking about so many different things and the thoughts continue to fly by, just out of your grasp. Frustration arises if you attempt to make use of your fantastic ideas, but there's no reason to be overly concerned about productivity for now. Instead, just sit back and enjoy the show."
gemini,2014-02-05,"You don't want to wait quietly on the sidelines and let something important happen without adding your two cents. In fact, you may be so sure of your convictions today that you are driven to speak your mind whether or not others want to hear your opinion. Keep in mind that you will be better off in the long run if you limit your comments to only the most critical issues. Your words will have more impact if you choose your battles wisely."
cancer,2014-02-05,"Your flexible attitude allows you to temporarily minimize an unresolved issue today. You can easily let go of emotions that were bothering you in return for a bit of spiritual refreshment and social enjoyment. However, you might not be ready to relinquish all your feelings, but at least set them aside for a while without judging anyone too harshly. Spending some quality time with your friends or family is more restorative if your heart is fully open to the experience."
leo,2014-02-05,"You may be lost in contemplation today, as you Lions drift off into a rather complex dreamscape. However, ignoring the interpersonal dynamics at work is not a wise move since the current situation could be complicated by someone's unexpressed feelings. As much as you want to escape into your inner world now, you must meet your professional obligations before slipping away to explore your imagination."
virgo,2014-02-05,"You might have already scheduled some fun for yourself today, only to discover that nothing is going to happen quite as you thought. You can still enjoy yourself, but it won't be without a bit of confusion creeping into your life. Bring yourself back to your center and shrug off the minor inconveniences or you could inadvertently make things worse. Remember the best way to minimize stress and impress others is to keep your sense of humor intact."
libra,2014-02-05,"You can get all wrapped up in mental gymnastics now, even though your stoicism may prevent you from talking about your worries with others. You feel like you should be more lighthearted today, but there are serious issues that just won't go away until you deal with them. Even with singular focus, resolution probably won't come quickly. In the meantime, do something creative with your irritation instead of spreading it to others."
scorpio,2014-02-05,"Ironically, you are aware of life's simplicity and its many complications at the very same time. With the evocative Moon moving through sensible Taurus today, your primary drive is toward experiencing pleasure. Yet, as a Scorpio, you always enjoy delving into a good mystery. Be careful if it appears that someone else can ameliorate your need for complexity, for this is just an illusion. Like it or not, your fate is completely in your own hands."
sagittarius,2014-02-05,"Returning to the basics isn't what normally motivates you, but simplification just may be the most critical theme in your life now. You are at a significant intersection today, and taking the on-ramp to the busy freeway might not be your best choice. You could have a very positive influence on your environment, but you must step out of the fast lane and onto the road less traveled so you can create the type of connections you want."
capricorn,2014-02-05,"Rethinking your core assumptions or reinventing your image offers the best chances for success today. Since this transformational process may continue for a while yet, it's wise to review and reevaluate last year's accomplishments while they are still fresh in your mind. Strive to put closure on as many loose ends as possible over the next few weeks to make plenty of room for your future exciting endeavors."
aquarius,2014-02-05,"Inner conflict may stress you out as you begin to reconsider a logical decision you recently made. Unfortunately, your feelings might not fall in line with your rational analysis today as you expected. Thankfully, your dilemma isn't all that obvious to anyone else; nevertheless, a special person could come to your rescue now. Remain open to receiving good news from a friend or family member, for it can provide just enough hope to settle your angst and nudge you in the right direction."
pisces,2014-02-05,"Your current indecision gets in the way of finalizing your plans. Naturally, you want to do what is best, but your good intentions may go awry today, especially if your expectations are unrealistic. It's difficult to say no to anything that sounds like fun, even if it isn't very practical. Instead of needlessly complicating matters even more, rely on a second opinion from someone you trust before making any commitments now that you will later regret."
aries,2014-02-06,"It feels as if the end of something is near, yet so is the beginning of what's next. Even if you have recently made observable progress, you can't seem to make that final push through to conclusion. Unfortunately, you won't be allowed to move on until you leave your previous project in a stable place. Do everything you can to make a smooth transition from cleaning up the past to living in the future."
taurus,2014-02-06,"Your unwillingness to change can be self-defeating today, making it smarter to compromise than to be left standing alone. You may feel as if everyone is moving in a direction that doesn't support your long-term goals. Don't be so concerned about getting it right that you do nothing at all. Adapting to the new circumstances demonstrates more strength now than holding your ground."
gemini,2014-02-06,It's all too easy to get so caught up in your current dreams that you believe they are real. There's nothing wrong with the luxury of being lost in fantasy as long as you can snap back to your more mundane responsibilities as needed. It's only when you start acting as if your illusion is the truth that trouble comes knocking at your door.
cancer,2014-02-06,"Life grows more complicated today if your friends propose such a sensible plan that there's no way you can say no. Unfortunately, joining forces with the group presents an awkward dilemma. You want to be a part of the action now, yet you also have a responsibility to follow your own feelings, too. Find a way to be true to yourself while also sharing in the larger vision. The benefit of collaborating with others ultimately outweighs the simplicity of working on your own."
leo,2014-02-06,"An unexpected turn of events may bring someone into your life who asks a favor of you. Although your first inclination might be to help if you can, be careful about overcommitting your resources. You will probably come through with the goods -- as you often do -- but the personal price could be greater than you want to pay. Remember, others will respect you more if you set boundaries before agreeing to everything under the Sun."
virgo,2014-02-06,"Trusting your own judgment is a wise practice since you can perceive problems long before they have a chance to manifest. Don't let others get away with their accusations that you are nit-picking or expecting too much. Your wary concern is not just a way to justify obsessing over the details today. Excellence in execution won't make up for an idea that is simply not a good one from the start. Remember, your pragmatic approach serves you well in the long run."
libra,2014-02-06,"You are feeling pulled in two completely opposite directions today. You can be emotionally aloof, allowing you to be involved in a high-intensity debate without succumbing to irrational arguments. Alternatively, you could become so enamored with one perspective that you lose your clarity. It's okay to take sides, but remain open to the voice of reason and sensitive to the feelings of others."
scorpio,2014-02-06,"Listening to others can be challenging today, especially when there's so much going on within your own imagination. You may see what you want quite clearly, yet the path to your desires is threatened by someone else's intentions which are very different than yours. Detaching from old expectations and focusing on your blessings in the present moment is your most reliable route to happiness."
sagittarius,2014-02-06,"Your long-term goals often seem more exciting to you than your pressing day-to-day affairs. However, you could benefit today by letting go of your plans for the future and dealing with your immediate situation. Instead of getting lost in the big picture, bring everything back to the here and now where even the tiniest changes can have positive consequences."
capricorn,2014-02-06,"You can rally the troops today because others see you as confident and competent. Even if you are stressed out because secretly you aren't so sure of yourself, rest assured that you are on the right track. Just don't overcompensate for your insecurities by demanding more from someone else than you are ready to give yourself. Instead of telling anyone what to do now, simply lead by example for the best results."
aquarius,2014-02-06,"You may be growing concerned that something isn't going according to your plans, even if it's really too soon to tell. Unfortunately, your worries can fuel uncertainty, taking the wind out of your sails. Loss of momentum could add discouragement to the mix, but if you pay attention to what's really happening, then you should be able to quickly overcome this temporary bout of self-doubt. Cultivating a positive attitude is your ticket to success."
pisces,2014-02-06,"Make your plans carefully today and then do your best to stick to them. Instead of being bounced around by everyone else's whims now, you can increase your chances of being successful by following your own agenda. Move steadily toward your goals, but don't get distracted because it will take constant vigilance to stay on course. Being the master of your own fate is possible if you practice patience and persistence."
aries,2014-02-07,"You may want to crawl into a safe place and let the world pass you by today. However, you might have to be satisfied with setting a short amount of time aside for quiet contemplation because work-related responsibilities keep you on the run. But don't worry if progress seems elusive now, even if you can't figure out the source of the delay. The good news is you probably won't have long to wait. You should be able to start seeing some movement when the pace of events picks up later in the day."
taurus,2014-02-07,"You have recently learned an important lesson from your involvement with a group, either socially or on the job. Now your perspective is beginning to change and you might need to return to your friends or coworkers to revisit the issues you previously discussed. Fortunately, augmenting your research online works in your favor with mental Mercury retrograding in your 11th House of Technology. Stay focused on your goals so you don't scatter your energy and waste valuable resources."
gemini,2014-02-07,"You are required to use your brain at work like never before. You're particularly sensitive to Mercury retrogrades in general, and this one brings an intellectual emphasis to your 10th House of Career. However, don't rush the process today; it may be an illusion if you think you already know the answers to your questions. Be patient; the real solutions will come to you when you are ready. In the meantime, keep your options as open as possible."
cancer,2014-02-07,"You have to deal with other people's feelings today and might not be able to avoid getting more emotionally involved than you prefer. This Mercury retrograde falls in your 9th House of Big Ideas, bringing up plans that you thought were already completed. However, you could have missed something important, and fixing things may require you to rethink the strategy once more to make certain that it's still viable. You are being given an opportunity to tie up loose ends before moving ahead -- so make the most of it."
leo,2014-02-07,"Although a bit of fantasy might play a role in your planning, your thoughts are not light and easy today. You have little patience for participating in trivial conversations as if you were chatting with people at a cocktail party. You may find yourself traveling over familiar ground, but you have more passion now to fuel your search. Indulge your interest in the mysteries so you can tap into the mother-lode of consciousness."
virgo,2014-02-07,"It's possible to have the same conversations over and over again as you realize that someone didn't even hear what you were trying to say the first time. Or, perhaps you missed the essence of what you were told and now you must listen to the entire story once more. Even if you don't find resolution today, keep communication channels open to prevent the energy from stagnating. A kind word can clear the air and break the ice."
libra,2014-02-07,"Your mind is currently preoccupied with the details of your employment while Mercury hangs out in your 6th House of Work. However, attempts to reexamine a variety of job-related issues could backfire unless you build a bit of cushion into your production schedule. Nevertheless, the emphasis may be on more pressing concerns today. Either way, a practical approach adds efficiency to your day. Make the most of your time by focusing on the present moment."
scorpio,2014-02-07,"Although you're still likely in the midst of a creative phase, writer's block can temporarily get in your way today. You have so much to say that it's challenging to fit your words into a clever package. But it's easier than it seems if you take your time instead of trying to do it all in one day. Remember that this is a gestation period and your current creations may not take full form until Mercury turns direct again in three weeks. Taking some time off for play might be just what you need to reconnect with your muse."
sagittarius,2014-02-07,"Be careful about getting so comfortable today that you say something that's better left unsaid. You believe you are being compassionate, but others might not perceive you the same way. They may think that you're only showing concern to protect your own interests. Try to understand the situation from multiple points of view, even if you feel vulnerable now. Seeing both sides of an issue is the first step to creating common ground."
capricorn,2014-02-07,"Distractions come in many forms now and might prevent you from finalizing an important plan. The current Mercury retrograde activates your 3rd House of Communication, amplifying the noise in your immediate environment. Resist getting caught up in the chaotic pace of events and circumstances. Instead of scattering your energy and spreading yourself too thin, cut back on the caffeine and try to get some much-needed rest."
aquarius,2014-02-07,"Even if you want to be in the spotlight, you might be better off working behind the scenes because other people can get on your nerves today. Part of your dilemma is your belief that someone is actually preventing you from reaching your goals now; however, it's possible that your real anxiety stems from feelings of inadequacy. Nevertheless, there's no reason to put yourself in solitary confinement; instead, graciously accept help when offered. Not only will you be more productive, but you may also make friends in the process."
pisces,2014-02-07,"You can barely keep up today with your inbox overflowing and your phone ringing off the hook. This Mercury retrograde occurs in your 1st House of Self, crowding your life with information from every corner of the universe. You could easily be swept up in captivating discussions with numerous people about a wide range of topics. If you trip over your words due to your excitement, just let the thoughts go. The important ones will return once the pace slows down."
aries,2014-02-08,"Everything seems to be jumping today yet you're uncertain whether or not you like it. This high-frequency buzz isn't necessarily good for getting your chores done because you can be a bit scattered while juggling too many activities. At first you might have fun, but then your amusement could turn to dismay when you realize that you can't keep up with what you started. Do yourself a favor; don't try to fit so much into your day and you'll be happier with the results."
taurus,2014-02-08,"You might want to try something that's out of the ordinary today, but it's still wise to think twice before you stir up more trouble than you need. If you aren't sure if your plan is a good idea, wait until tomorrow when your desires will be more rational. Finding a healthy outlet for your restlessness could alleviate the temptation to agitate an already unstable situation. Satisfy your taste for adventure in a way that you won't regret."
gemini,2014-02-08,"You are acutely aware that you have more options now than you previously realized. Although having so many choices is an exciting prospect, the Moon's visit to your sign today also poses problems of its own, since you might not be able to decide which strategy makes the most sense. Don't waste energy spinning your wheels trying to force an answer now because it probably won't be the right one if it doesn't come naturally. Wait for your intuition to guide you in the right direction."
cancer,2014-02-08,"Your mind is abuzz with original ideas today, but you're wise to keep quiet because you might not be able to explain yourself very well. Instead of attempting to convince anyone that your plans could be successful now, just concentrate on doing the work. Once you have some positive results to show for your efforts, others will be more likely to roll up their sleeves and jump in to support you."
leo,2014-02-08,"Your attempts to make any headway on a variety of projects may be stymied today for several different reasons. Although you might have good intentions coupled with tireless enthusiasm, you still could end up feeling frustrated unless you can prioritize and focus on only one thing at a time. However, if you just can't resist, at least give yourself a break and take it easy for a bit before adding more to your plate."
virgo,2014-02-08,"A flurry of unexpected events tests your ability to multitask today. Fortunately, you could come through with flying colors if you look at it as a game you need to win. But if you take yourself too seriously now, you're likely to sabotage your efforts because of a fear of failure. However, if you're not overly attached to the outcome, it might seem as if time slows down, allowing you to magically complete everything right on schedule."
libra,2014-02-08,"You could be in a playful mood today, even if you have a lot of work to do. Thankfully, your easygoing attitude enables you to overcome most obstacles with finesse. Spend a bit of time making plans for an upcoming adventure or vacation. It doesn't matter if it's only a night on the town; just having something fun on your calendar will help you to settle down and focus on the mundane chores you have to do right now."
scorpio,2014-02-08,"You are a walking paradox today, as you strive for depth and intensity while still maintaining a lighthearted approach with others. Although you might appear to be enjoying yourself, the uneasiness that lurks just beneath your smile is obvious to those who know you well. Nevertheless, it's still wise to think about the consequences of what you intend to say before you speak. Remember that your unedited words could open Pandora's box, which may be better off left closed until tomorrow."
sagittarius,2014-02-08,"Everyone seems a bit restless today, which only further contributes to your current lack of concentration. Although you may kick off the day knowing exactly what you're going to do, a series of distractions leads you on one detour after another. Don't blame your lack of direction on others; if you weren't so fidgety it would be much easier to stay on track. Instead of worrying about what isn't getting done, just do whatever you can and, if necessary, complete your work tomorrow."
capricorn,2014-02-08,"You might be feeling a bit irresponsible today, even if you have pressing obligations. It's not that you plan to blow off your commitments; instead, you may grow bored with the required level of concentration. Your thoughts are moving at light speed and they just don't seem to fit into the narrow confines of your agenda. Don't beat yourself up if you cannot hold your focus now; things will quickly return to normal in the next few days."
aquarius,2014-02-08,"Your ideas may not make a whole lot of sense to your friends and family today, but then again, you might not care if anyone understands you, anyhow. You're currently on an individuality kick and want to do everything in a radical manner. Although it's fine to demonstrate your independence, you can take it too far now. Moderating your brilliance with a touch of practicality will enhance your life instead of just turning it upside down."
pisces,2014-02-08,"You are suddenly quite clear about what you want, but as soon as you open your mouth to share your thoughts with your friends your solid plan starts to melt into an idle fantasy. Part of the problem now may be that you don't know when to stop talking. Remember, the fewer words you speak today, the more precise your message."
aries,2014-02-09,"It's a well-known fact that you Rams often speak before you think about the impact of your words. This impulsive behavior can create problems today because you don't appear to be willing to control the flow of your thoughts. However, it's tricky to distinguish between a sensible idea and one that's out in left field. Take time to consider the consequences before opening your mouth; otherwise, you might wish that you remained silent. Before broadcasting your ideas, share them with a person you trust and see what happens."
taurus,2014-02-09,"It feels as if your busy weekend is quickly coming to an end before you even get a chance to have any fun. Nevertheless, it's wiser to simply grit your teeth and do whatever is expected of you now without stirring up too much trouble. If you don't waste energy resisting, you could actually accomplish more than you expect. Think about what you want to achieve in the days ahead and make a practical plan to reach your goals. Your mature behavior brings a lasting satisfaction that transient pleasures can't supply."
gemini,2014-02-09,"You feel like an eagle today, soaring higher and higher to catch the wind currents. Luckily, the right breeze can carry you as far and wide as you let it. However, this isn't a free ride because you have to pay careful attention to anything that might upset your equilibrium. Don't try to exert control over everything or you could lose your momentum. You have plenty to say, but the present circumstances require you to be discerning about how you deliver your messages."
cancer,2014-02-09,"Your friends may not appreciate how fast your inner wheels are turning today, but you're expending a lot of energy just to keep up with your own thoughts. It takes extra effort to make it look like you have things under control now. Just remember, it's crucial to remain focused on the events of the present moment, especially if you're tempted to escape into your dreamworld and drift for a while. Put your mental agility to good use by helping others and you might be pleasantly surprised with the gift you receive in return."
leo,2014-02-09,"Your actions often communicate your messages effectively, but today it's more direct to tell someone what you feel rather than trying to demonstrate it. However, you must be careful because your confidence prompts you to overlook an essential fact. It may be tough to regain lost ground if you say something that shows your lack of understanding, so proceed with caution and cover all your bases as you go along. Listening as much as you speak leads to the best possible outcome."
virgo,2014-02-09,"You might attempt to uncover some important information today, but it's as if several radio stations are coming in simultaneously. You want to find a way to filter out some of the noise, but it's nearly impossible when you can't tell which signal is the one you need to hear. Even if you are more comfortable using analytical tools, it's smarter now to temporarily turn off the incoming data stream and just tune into your intuition instead."
libra,2014-02-09,"It seems as if someone is barking orders at you now, but you're not ready to blindly follow. Take your own sweet time before responding today, because it doesn't make sense to react before you fully understand what's going on. Although it appears as if everything is out in the open, you might still believe there is more to learn. Don't let anyone coerce you into an agreement until you have done your research and reached your own independent conclusion."
scorpio,2014-02-09,"You're capable of saying exactly what you mean today, and you can stir up trouble unless you closely monitor your words. You may be so determined to make someone see your point of view that you don't know when to stop trying. It's difficult to just walk away from a discussion until you have covered the same ground one too many times. Needless to say, this overpowering intensity might alienate a close friend in the process. Although your passion is impressive, it's best to end a conversation with the other person wanting more, not less."
sagittarius,2014-02-09,"You want to squeeze every drop of meaning out of your conversations today, which might leave you with a few unsatisfying encounters. Don't let people ramble on without purpose; use your persuasive charm to help them focus so they can successfully make their points. However, you must be extra careful not to finish anyone else's thoughts because you don't know what they're trying to say. Instead of interrupting, encourage your friends to express what's in their hearts and then listen in between the words for the real messages."
capricorn,2014-02-09,"It's nearly impossible to stay anchored to the mundane world today while your thoughts are wandering around in the clouds of illusion. You might grow a bit anxious because you're uncomfortable with your own current lack of practicality. Unfortunately, it's challenging to maintain the concentration necessary to focus on your work. However, keeping both feet on the ground could cause you to lose the magic of a greater vision. Dream today; make it real tomorrow."
aquarius,2014-02-09,You are likely to notice unusual occurrences and synchronistic events that demonstrate the flimsiness of the boundaries between this world and other dimensions. But don't bet your future on something that's happening in a parallel universe unless you're willing to bring your thoughts back down to earth today. It's okay to watch the magic unfold as long as you don't lose track of what's important in the here and now.
pisces,2014-02-09,"It's as if you're walking on a high wire today and can make a dangerous act seem perfectly safe to others. Your apparent courage might actually be linked to denial, but focusing on positive thoughts is a smart idea, nonetheless. Still, a little caution is advised, for unfettered imagination could also breed uncertainty now. Do your best to anchor your thinking to the mundane physical world, even while performing your own special kind of magic."
aries,2014-02-10,"Your head and your heart are in the middle of their favorite argument about which one has the best advice to give. You are torn between following your rational logic and surrendering to your irrational feelings. But even after you have analyzed the situation and determined what's best, you are still intrigued by yet another direction. Ironically, there may not be a single correct answer today, regardless of which approach you favor. Explore all the possibilities while keeping your options open as long as you can."
taurus,2014-02-10,"Try not to be overly dramatic when you tell someone what you think today, for you can quickly lose credibility if you overstate your position. Stick to the facts and you should be able to sway others  to agree with your point of view. Often your greatest obstacle is your own stubbornness. Luckily, your willingness to compromise now is a relief for everyone involved. Establishing common ground right from the start is the fastest route to success."
gemini,2014-02-10,"If you run into a wall today, your unexpressed emotions might actually prevent you from having your way. However, don't give up; there's no need to stop yet. You can still reach your goals, but you first have to process your repressed feelings that aren't yet integrated into your daily life. Acting from your heart now can increase your chances of getting what you want as long as you're honest with yourself."
cancer,2014-02-10,"Your feelings grow too big to hide as the reflective Moon returns to your sign very early this morning. You may be convinced to disclose something you haven't yet shared, even if revealing your desires makes things temporarily awkward. If you are keeping any secrets, use this time to clear the air. Think about the potential of the weeks ahead and then set the record straight while you can. There's no time like the present to be your authentic self."
leo,2014-02-10,"Although avoiding the chores on your list today isn't a great idea, some quiet time for reflection can also be rejuvenating. You will be happier and more productive if you balance your responsibilities with a bit of relaxation. But don't attempt to escape your obligations completely or you could regret it sooner than you think when you're required to go back and finish up your work."
virgo,2014-02-10,"Balancing your desire to spend time with your friends against your need to be alone can be quite a tricky dance today. However, you could choose to sit back and be the quiet one in the group, since you really don't need to be talkative to enjoy yourself. However, no matter what you do, integrity is crucial because you are setting a long-term trajectory these days. Even if you don't want to reveal too much, speak your truth by saying what's in your heart."
libra,2014-02-10,"Although you're usually not the one to be the mothering type, you're inclined to take care of anyone that comes into your sphere of influence today. However, you can be generous to a fault, so be careful that you don't suppress your anger just for the sake of approval. Everyone around you will feel more comfortable if you are honest in your relationships, even if there needs to be some intense discussions along the way. True intimacy is possible if you're willing to keep it real."
scorpio,2014-02-10,"You may be drawn to a romantic notion of getting away from it all, yet this kind of escape might sound better than it really is. Nevertheless, a well-planned trip makes sense now. There's no need to be impulsive about it, but the sooner you get out of town for some rest and relaxation, the better. If possible, invite someone else along on your adventure, since the energy you receive from others on your upcoming excursion can fuel your enthusiasm."
sagittarius,2014-02-10,"A touch of tension hangs in the air this afternoon and discussing your discomfort may just add to the uneasy atmosphere. In fact, even working closely with others now could agitate your frustration. Ironically, you don't really want to be alone today, but it still might be better to withdraw for a little while. If you begin to lose patience, taking a practical approach will help you keep everything in a healthy perspective."
capricorn,2014-02-10,"Although you might feel as if this is a great day to try an innovative approach to a project at work, don't lose sight of the more mundane aspects of your creative skills. It could be a real challenge to get others to support your ideas if they don't fit into the current plan. Thankfully, you have the amazing ability to transform your thoughts into actions now. If you don't waste energy doubting yourself, you can accomplish a lot more than you expect."
aquarius,2014-02-10,"Your secret agent lifestyle has outlived its usefulness at work and keeping something hidden might only make you feel uncomfortable now. It's time to open up and spill the beans. There's no need to hang on to the past any longer. Push yourself out of your comfort zone by setting new ideas into motion today. Others could appreciate your honesty so much that they follow your example, giving you the perfect chance to lend a sympathetic ear."
pisces,2014-02-10,"An emotionally charged atmosphere presents problems today. You may even become so involved in a heated discussion now that you have a hard time separating your feelings from those of everyone else. Your sensitivity is valuable, but only if you are willing to see things realistically. Rely only on the facts that you can check. But don't close down your imagination for too long; it will serve you well again in just a few days."
aries,2014-02-11,"Although you're ready to plan for a new adventure today, you might have to learn a tough lesson before you continue. Instead of turning this speed bump into a major detour by fighting against the inevitable, take the time to consider why you may be running into obstacles now. Whatever you do, don't attempt to overpower the facts with your assertive nature. Only when you accept the truth will you be allowed to move forward."
taurus,2014-02-11,"You receive a fleeting glimpse of what's ahead now, but you might not be able to proceed as quickly as you would like. There's nothing wrong with letting your desires motivate you as long as they are realistic. Unfortunately, you may be under a lot of pressure today if you underestimate the energy required to complete a job. Don't make any promises you cannot keep; it's far better to let someone down gently in the present moment than to be the source of deeper disappointment later on."
gemini,2014-02-11,"You're talking a serious game today, but you might not have a clue how to follow through with the necessary actions. But before you attempt to dance your way around an awkward situation, it's a good idea to think about the consequences of any irresponsible behavior. Thankfully, sharing your feelings, including your concerns, in a mature manner can turn an uncomfortable moment into a positive experience."
cancer,2014-02-11,"You might not be all that enthusiastic about the potential of a current romance and your avoidance of the truth only serves to complicate matters. Granted, you could always go ahead and focus on the advantages of being in a relationship, but risking your heart on an improbable future won't resolve the tension in the present. Expressing your reservations with as much kindness as possible could open the door to a much-needed conversation and even a new level of intimacy."
leo,2014-02-11,"You may believe it's in your best interest to avoid a discussion that reveals your true feelings today. However, it's better to face the truth head on than let it gradually eat away at your confidence. You can broach nearly any subject as long as you do so with compassion. Unfortunately, your overactive imagination might add to your current confusion, making it crucial to stick as close to the facts as you can. Save the dreaming for another day when there's not so much at stake."
virgo,2014-02-11,"You have a lot on your plate today, yet unforeseen circumstances pull your attention away from your real work and may impede your progress. Unfortunately, the pressure to finish your tasks can create additional stress if you fall behind schedule. Nevertheless, your fear of how others might respond is more disruptive to your productivity now than anything else. Rest assured that doing your best will be more than good enough to satisfy everyone else."
libra,2014-02-11,"Your creative energy is on the rise, but you might have trouble gaining enough traction to manifest something tangible today. It's as if your most productive ideas are blocked by circumstances beyond your control. But this isn't a sensible time to quit since you're probably closer to the finish line than you realize. Rather than endlessly weighing all your options, let your imagination be your guide. For now, dreaming your way into the future is more powerful than following a script."
scorpio,2014-02-11,"You could be your own worst enemy today, succumbing to feelings of self-doubt -- even if they are unwarranted. The Sun's square to hardnosed Saturn in your intense sign can make someone's criticism sound worse than it actually is. Instead of imagining what might go wrong, counteract the resistance you now face by visualizing what will go right. Don't take no for an answer; your persistence speaks louder than words."
sagittarius,2014-02-11,"The best way to accomplish everything today is to write down all your appointments and commitments, and then juggle all of them into a schedule that maximizes your efficiency. But no matter how well you structure your day, you still need to leave room for things taking longer than you expect. Even with the best of intentions, it's also important to know when to toss in the towel. Luckily, your sense of humor can save the day if you maintain a positive attitude."
capricorn,2014-02-11,"You want to be more socially involved now, especially if it feels like you're on the outside looking in. Fortunately, you have the gift of long-range vision at your disposal, enabling you to see the bigger picture. Don't let petty ego wounds get in the way of your larger success that might be just around the corner. Acknowledge the reality of the present moment and keep moving forward. If you continue to act in a positive manner, others will likely gravitate toward you before you know it."
aquarius,2014-02-11,"It's so easy to worry about being wrong now that you might spend too much time defending your actions. The willful Sun in your logical sign squares authoritative Saturn today, testing your ability to live up to your commitments. Unfortunately, your good intentions aren't sufficient to overcome a poor judgment call. Nevertheless, the ends don't justify the means. Forget about taking any shortcuts; instead, listen to the feedback you receive and do what's expected of you with determination and grace."
pisces,2014-02-11,"There's very little margin for error today, so don't allow your changing moods to influence your actions. Acknowledging your feelings is one thing, but letting your emotions control your behavior is not a good idea now. Take a few deep breaths and give yourself sufficient time to rationally analyze your next move before you do anything you might regret. Follow a practical plan without letting your heart distract you from the work at hand."
aries,2014-02-12,"You can work yourself into a state of high anxiety this morning, but luckily, your moodiness dissipates later in the day. Paradoxically, you might even feel strangely optimistic without anything actually happening to support your belief that things are improving. Nevertheless, a sudden adjustment in attitude is exactly the catalyst you need to shift your life into the next gear. Don't be afraid to plan for the future; it will be here sooner than you think."
taurus,2014-02-12,"You could spend much of your day revisiting problems that developed over the last few weeks. Thankfully, your frustration is fading, but the desired results are still beyond your grasp. Oddly enough, your confidence remains unshaken and you're sure things will turn around without a lot of extra work on your part. Taking the easy way out is tempting, but a proactive approach to change can make the difference between failure and success."
gemini,2014-02-12,"Your current plans may not be progressing as quickly as you wish. You might even be slightly annoyed with someone who has been standing in your way, but now they appear to change their behavior and help, rather than block, your efforts. Holding a grudge is ill-advised; accept the energetic shift as a positive sign that you're on the right track today, even if your goals still seem far out of reach. A grateful outlook serves you well."
cancer,2014-02-12,"Although you may feel mired in an emotional conflict, circumstances begin to change this afternoon, prompting you to realize that you have less time than you thought. Don't be lazy; if you have something to say, go ahead and speak your piece, even if your declaration might spark an uncomfortable discussion. Getting your feelings out into the open today helps to get the ball rolling and sets the stage for resolution. Now is better than never."
leo,2014-02-12,"The waiting game is over; it's time to make your move. Perhaps you have recently tried a variety of tactics to push a pressing relationship issue along, but to no avail. Now that the Moon is returning to your dramatic sign, the winds of change are blowing up a storm. There's no reason to resist the movement, even if you aren't sure which direction you're heading. Be bold and ride this cosmic wave for all it's worth."
virgo,2014-02-12,"Even if you have something important to say to a coworker today, you may end up keeping your thoughts to yourself. Although you might imagine shouting your message from the top of a mountain, the Moon's shift into your 12th House of Privacy tells a different story. Sharing the news with grandiose declarations isn't your style, and could leave you with pangs of regret. Focusing on the details is still the most effective way to make your case. Your silence says volumes to those who bother to listen."
libra,2014-02-12,"You can see potential in things that other folks miss today, and it's up to you to use this special vision to your advantage. Ultimately, it's your innate creativity that enables you to discover these magical possibilities. Now it's time to jump in and play an active role in manifesting results. However, don't try to do everything all at once or you might burn out too quickly. Follow your intuition and turn your dreams into tangible reality."
scorpio,2014-02-12,"It's about time that you receive the credit you deserve for all the work that you do. However, the current recognition might not be about your regular duties at home or on the job. More likely, you're being acknowledged for what you bring to the world by who you are when you show up. It may be nearly impossible for others to put this special quality into words, yet you will know you are appreciated now by how people act in your presence. Don't push away the love; receive it with a gracious heart and a touch of humility."
sagittarius,2014-02-12,"Your future is beginning to open up and your dreams appear a bit closer than before. Nevertheless, you are still aware of how much planning there is yet to be done. Thankfully, you are feeling more energetic day by day. Additionally, it seems as if the mental fog is lifting and your thinking is growing sharper. It's a good idea now to map out your schedule for the next few weeks. Make the necessary commitment, figure out the logistics and get to work today."
capricorn,2014-02-12,"Today's dilemma might stem from not knowing how much to tell others regarding your latest news. You may be really excited about a new project, plan or relationship, but aren't ready to say anything until you are more certain that everything is moving along as you wish. Nevertheless, it might be smarter to share your enthusiasm now, along with your concerns. The feedback and support you receive can help you more than you think."
aquarius,2014-02-12,"Although you may start your day in a quiet frame of mind, an enthusiastic friend could coax you out of your seclusion. Perhaps you thought that you would simply go about your day, doing your work and minding your own business, only to discover a much different path in store for you now. Don't resist an enticing invitation just because you have too much work to do. You can always come back and tie up loose ends later on. Surrendering to a surprise might just be your best option today."
pisces,2014-02-12,"You're standing at the edge of a clearing, yet you can't tell which way to go. Fortunately, you will step through this window of opportunity as your direction becomes apparent over the next few days. In the meantime, make the most of where you are now by paying attention to every little detail. Observe how others respond to you, but don't forget to also tune into your own creative process. Remember, if something occurs in your imagination, there's a good chance it can also happen in your real life."
aries,2014-02-13,"You naturally assume you're ready for nearly anything but you might have some lingering doubts today, even after you say yes to an intriguing offer. Perhaps your uncertainty stems from being acutely aware of the consequences of your actions. Or maybe you are reminded of a past event when your immediate reaction created more trouble than it was worth. A touch of self-restraint now could be enough to prevent your world from turning upside down."
taurus,2014-02-13,You might have to shift your attention to an unfolding domestic drama now that the Moon is visiting your 4th House of Home and Family. You may be so busy at work lately that you're not spending sufficient quality time with your loved ones. Let those who are special to you know how you feel or they could end up wondering if you care anymore. A little bit of authentic affection goes a long way to make everyone happy.
gemini,2014-02-13,Your unrealistic expectations about your schedule encourage you to think that you can take time for your own pleasure today. But it's easy to set yourself up for failure now by wanting too much. Big ideas must be pared back over the days ahead or you might hit a wall of resistance. It's better to constrain yourself voluntarily than to wait for unpleasant circumstances to suddenly stop you in your tracks. Choosing a more responsible approach improves your chances for success.
cancer,2014-02-13,"Demonstrating your love with tenderness is usually easier than making grandiose gestures. But you could do things differently today, snagging someone's attention by overplaying your part in a drama. After all is said and done, you may feel embarrassed, wishing you hadn't made a scene. Although there's no need to overstate your feelings now, you don't have to apologize if you do. There's nothing wrong with sharing your heart."
leo,2014-02-13,"Avoid the temptation to express yourself in a melodramatic way today because you could shock others if you go too far. Although everything feels urgent now, it's wise to turn down the volume on your intensity. Thankfully, the drama will begin to subside after tomorrow's Leo Full Moon, yet you may end up wishing you kept some of your secrets to yourself. Remember, you don't have to share all of your fantasies; some things are better left to the imagination, instead."
virgo,2014-02-13,"You might experience an exciting epiphany today that empowers you to break free from an old pattern at work. Unfortunately, endless logical analysis isn't a viable substitute for direct action. Even if you know what to do now, you're still limited by how you see yourself in relationship to others. Experiment, be outrageous and imagine possibilities you haven't yet considered. Believing in magic can make amazing things happen."
libra,2014-02-13,"Making the most of your time today is the most meaningful gift you can give to yourself and others. Be courageous; stepping into your leadership role and setting a good example are the smartest ways to give your coworkers an inkling of what they can do. If you settle for less now, then that's what you'll inadvertently pass along to everyone else, diluting the shared experience. Seize the moment and your allies will happily follow along."
scorpio,2014-02-13,"Your need for peace and quiet comes and goes in waves today, but you can't justify an escape until you meet your previous obligations. Of course, you are naturally inclined to honor the promises you made to help others, instead of just taking care of your own needs. Although it may seem impossible at first, you can have it both ways now if you're willing to take a risk. A radical approach might be the key to finishing up your work early, leaving time for your well-deserved rest and relaxation."
sagittarius,2014-02-13,"Although you technically agree that rules are necessary to maintain order, it's still fun to dream far beyond the accepted norm. Unfortunately, you don't like to feel restrained by the same laws that govern everyone else. You are so enthused by the potential of the moment now that you may not even consider what's right and what's wrong. Luckily, cosmic energy is on your side, so taking a calculated risk is a good idea today; you can always philosophize about it after the fact."
capricorn,2014-02-13,"You want to demonstrate how intuitive you are now and might go out of your way just to let others see you in action. Sharing your inner process with those closest to you can be exhilarating, but the interpersonal dynamics may grow complicated if you are insecure about your current approach. It's not time to worry about anyone's reaction to your quirky behavior. Just trust your hunches today; they won't likely steer you wrong."
aquarius,2014-02-13,"You are short on patience now, especially with those who want your attention so badly today that they do a song and dance to get it. You just can't understand why anyone would need to put on such a performance since you are usually so good at recognizing people's contributions. Although you prefer to ignore someone's selfish behavior, you may be better off today indulging others for the sake of group harmony."
pisces,2014-02-13,"You have a lot on your plate today, but your coworkers might not be aware of your strong commitment to get things done. Your hard work may go unnoticed at first but don't let your need for recognition be your only motivation. Still, receiving praise is satisfying, as long as you don't quit before your tasks are completely finished. Satisfaction from a job well done can be surprisingly sweet."
aries,2014-02-14,You have high hopes and are willing to take a risk to fulfill your heart's wishes today. You might not want to take no for an answer because the exuberant Leo Full Moon in your 5th House of Romance encourages you to expect too much from love. Tempering your dreams with a bit of realism may be enough to prevent disillusionment in relationships. Persistence may work in your favor now as long as you remember to be sensitive to the feelings of others.
taurus,2014-02-14,"Although jumping on a plane might not be possible now, you are still tempted to escape by going somewhere far away in your mind. But this is a time to be practical, not dreamy when it comes to what really matters. The Leo Full Moon in your 4th House of Roots is a reflector that shines a bright light on family issues. Fantasies only distract you from the real love that could be found at home. Real emotional comfort is closer than you think."
gemini,2014-02-14,"You have a few tricks up your sleeve today when it comes to expressing your attraction to someone special. The playful Leo Full Moon highlights your 3rd House of Communication, inspiring you to take a chance when it comes to love. However, you could overdo it by getting carried away with your feelings. Being confident is one thing, but too much bravado on your part might spell an early end to your evening. Remember, a healthy interaction is a two-way street so be willing to receive as well as you give."
cancer,2014-02-14,"There could be an upcoming change in your income status or, perhaps, a shift in a business partnership. The bright Leo Full Moon illuminates your 2nd House of Money, so you might be more concerned with the bottom line than you are with romance now. Nevertheless, look at everything in a broader context. Practice compassion for others who may be experiencing uncertain times, too. A quick reality check today will give you a more balanced perspective; money can't buy you love."
leo,2014-02-14,"You may need to show a bit of caution in the romance department today, even if you know exactly what you want. The melodramatic Leo Full Moon floods your 1st House of Personality, possibly stressing your relationships and temporarily turning your life inside out. You could become overly defensive if someone stands in your way, so remind yourself that it's not necessary to express everything you feel. Waiting until tomorrow before saying what's on your mind will probably be better off for everyone involved."
virgo,2014-02-14,"You might feel invisible today, especially if you think that someone special isn't taking notice of you. Don't fight the natural flow of energy as the Leo Full Moon illuminates your 12th House of Privacy, hiding your emotions from view. Nevertheless, your actions will still have the impact you want. Save the flowery speeches and love letters for some other time. Just let behavior do its magic. Even the most subtle gestures will have positive impact if your heart is in the right place."
libra,2014-02-14,"You might decide to play it low key today and keep your personal feelings to yourself. However, you expressive Leo Moon falls in your 11th House of Social Networking, encouraging you to get involved with a group activity. Although you might resist at first, you're like to find pleasure in your participation once you overcome your initial anxiety. Let go of your personal desires and melt into the group experience for now. Surprisingly, you can derive a great deal of emotional satisfaction by being part of something larger than yourself."
scorpio,2014-02-14,"People are likely to stand up and take notice of you today, but the recognition you receive may be professional rather than personal. Fortunately, the theatrical Leo Full Moon brightens your 10th House of Public Status, empowering you to reveal your feelings to someone special. You're at the top of your game now and it's rather easy for you to shift the focus from business to pleasure if you are romantically inclined. Don't be afraid to make your move as long as you pay careful attention to the reactions you receive."
sagittarius,2014-02-14,"You might be dreaming of a trip with your partner or special friend, but travel plans could require extra attention today as circumstances change. Even the simplest of dinner plans may have to be modified at the last minute. Ultimately, the bold Leo Full Moon in your 9th House of Adventure reminds you to focus on your personal needs and do whatever it takes to reach your destination. The details may be unstable, but don't lose sight of your goal. Following your bliss sometimes requires perseverance and hard work."
capricorn,2014-02-14,"You may have to revisit a financial decision today that could alter you evening plans. Instead of making a unilateral decision, it's smarter to check in with your friend or partner. It could take courage on your part to reveal your vulnerability, especially with the proud Leo Full Moon falling in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Don't slip into the trap of pretending that everything is fine if it's not. Taking a risk and sharing your concerns could be the key to increased intimacy."
aquarius,2014-02-14,"Don't focus on your shortcomings today, especially if you're worried that someone doesn't like you as much as you like him or her. Today's emotional Leo Full Moon in your 7th House of Relationships is opposite the Sun in your cerebral sign, reminding you of the sharp contrast between your subjective feelings and objective reality. Your performance might fall short of your expectations, but you may be judging yourself harsher than anyone else does. Simply doing the best you can will likely be more than enough."
pisces,2014-02-14,"Although someone you love might rain on your parade today, your positive attitude may be enough to chase the bad emotional weather away. However, you won't find your way back to the sunny side of the street unless you take a chance and give your imagination free rein to explore a new avenues of expression. The Leo Full Moon is lighting up your 6th House of Details, so paying attention to the little things can make the difference between failure and success. A bit of forethought and follow-through goes a long way."
aries,2014-02-15,"It's frustrating when you believe you know what you want, but don't have a clue how to get it. You wish you could rely on your friends to help you out but they have their own issues to handle today, so you might be more successful to set out on your own. There's no need to wait for the advice if it's not forthcoming now; just do what feels right in your heart and figure out the rest along the way."
taurus,2014-02-15,"Don't sell your career potential short today, for your innate practicality can impress others more than you realize. But overanalyzing the logistical requirements won't help you make the best choices; just depend on your hunches to lead you in the right direction. Following the tried and true path may not be enough now to take you where you want to go. Take a chance and trust your intuition, instead."
gemini,2014-02-15,"It's wiser to stick to your previous agenda than it is to wonder if you will benefit from a spur of the moment decision. A concrete plan serves you well today, even if this isn't your typical style. Advanced preparation now increases your chances of success in the future. Paradoxically, you can obtain the freedom you seek if you apply yourself with discipline from the beginning."
cancer,2014-02-15,"Stressing over a current dilemma only further clouds your judgment today. Your effectiveness hinges more on your positive attitude now than your specific actions. If you don't get it right the first time, people will probably be more understanding than you expect, so there's no need to be so hard on yourself. Blue skies will return once you accept the fact that you are already doing the best you can."
leo,2014-02-15,"Your current practical demeanor makes it easier to pay serious attention to your regular routines. However, even your best ideas must work within the context of everyone's plans if you are to be successful now. It may feel demeaning when you have to play by other people's rules, but the minor discomfort is worth it in the long run. If you have something useful to offer today, find enough humility to share your brilliance without having to take credit for the outcome."
virgo,2014-02-15,"A bit of tenderhearted compassion softens your emotional edges and lightens your analytical mind. Whether in love or at play, you can accomplish much more than you imagine today, but not in your typically efficient manner. Even if you know you are right, you won't gain anything by being too pushy. Adopting an easygoing approach now helps to get your messages across and move your agenda forward in a timelier manner."
libra,2014-02-15,"Your living space might benefit from a burst of inspiration today, but this is only one way to demonstrate your natural creativity. However don't isolate yourself; spending time with old friends or close family also turns out to be a sensible investment of your time and energy now, recharging your soul and warming your heart. Ultimately, success is sweeter when you can share it with those you love."
scorpio,2014-02-15,"You might not want your friends to tell you what to do today, especially because you already know the obvious. Neither do you need them to remind you of your shortcomings because you can't forget your failures and are aware of your own emotional baggage. Usually, heightened self-awareness works in your favor, but you won't gain much by being so hard on yourself now. Practice true forgiveness and remember that it starts with yourself."
sagittarius,2014-02-15,"Your long-term goals are on your mind now that the Moon is traveling through your 10th House of Career. However, there may be more important issues than your job that demand your attention today. Review the current relationship between chasing your professional aspirations and spending time with the people who matter the most. Keep in mind that making minor adjustments to your plans can bring about a positive shift in the overall quality of your life."
capricorn,2014-02-15,"You may have to make changes to your financial plans today to allow for a discretionary purchase. Although you might not have too much cash in reserve, buying something unusual now could be a smart investment anyhow. Appeal to the desires of those who might be interested in joining you, without compromising your own ethics. Remember to act sensibly and you will likely receive approval and respect from others."
aquarius,2014-02-15,"You wish you could just watch people all day long now because you are intrigued with the varieties of human experience. Ironically, you might be more concerned with global issues today than you are with your own circumstances. Nevertheless, your sharp perceptions make this a great day to step back from your responsibilities to take a clear and objective look at your own life. If you're not on the right track, channel your energies in a more promising direction."
pisces,2014-02-15,"You are committed to working tirelessly today in a sincere attempt to make your life more meaningful. However, the practical Virgo Moon is visiting your 7th House of Companions, so flying solo might not sound all that attractive now. Seek out competent and creative people to spice up your day. You have a better chance of realizing your dreams with the support of those who are on a similar path as you."
aries,2014-02-16,"You're of two minds today and may not be satisfied with the choices you make no matter what you do. On one hand, you're committed to quietly going about your chores and doing everything as you should. On the other hand, you're tired of always playing by the rules. You're ready to fight back against any signs of boredom or restraint now. Moderating your impulses might not sound like fun, yet you will be happier in the long run if you choose your battles wisely."
taurus,2014-02-16,"It may feel as if others are trying to talk you into joining them in an activity you wish to skip. However, you could miss out on a wonderful experience now if you say no. The problem is that you have to give up control to be involved and you're not willing to let go without a good reason. Sharing your concerns just might bring the answers you seek, allowing you to happily partake in the fun without further thought."
gemini,2014-02-16,"Responsibilities at home require your immediate attention today, but this isn't necessarily your idea of how you want to spend the day. Unfortunately, you may not be able to enjoy yourself if you ignore your previous obligations because you can't stop thinking about the chores you left undone. The solution is annoyingly simple now; do your work first and then you will be free to pursue whatever activities you want with a clear conscience."
cancer,2014-02-16,"If someone leans on you for support today, you will probably feel obligated to help them. But it seems like one thing after another pulls you away from responding the way you want. Your discomfort grows from the high number of distractions you face throughout the day. Fortunately, you have enough determination to set clear boundaries if you so choose. Remember, you can be busy with other activities tomorrow, but now you must come through for someone you love."
leo,2014-02-16,"You must pay attention to the smallest details today as you take on a very exacting project. Normally, your ability to focus is not an issue, but your energy may be a bit scattered now. Don't judge yourself too harshly if you realize that you committed to a higher level of perfection than you can deliver in such a short time frame. Just do the best job possible and then move on. Taking pride in your work brings the ultimate satisfaction."
virgo,2014-02-16,"Logic often runs your world but your restlessness might just get the best of you today. Your intentions are clear, but your follow-through may be more challenging as you attempt to turn your promises into action. Don't stress out; you are capable of extraordinary things now. Satisfying your need for excitement is just as fulfilling for your soul as finishing your chores. Fortunately, you can have your cake and eat it too."
libra,2014-02-16,"Complicated emotional dynamics at home might have resisted resolution until now. However, it may feel as if something is finally beginning to shift today. Unfortunately, revealing your eagerness could sabotage your progress if you react too fast or push too hard. As counter-intuitive as it seems, subtlety is your most intelligent strategy. Keep cool instead of getting caught up in the drama of the moment so you can be the anchor in the middle of storm."
scorpio,2014-02-16,"You feel quite picky about whom you want to socialize with today, but your overly critical attitude could actually stand in the way of your fun. Even if you are sure about your current perceptions, keep in mind that your subjectivity might be warping your perspective more than you realize. It's probably smarter to just go along with the group now and save your judgments for another day. Being kind to everyone, including yourself, is the right thing to do."
sagittarius,2014-02-16,"Your meticulous thinking can save the day, but you might need to set aside your personal desires for a while. Nevertheless, you are up for the task now as clever Mercury aligns with your key planet Jupiter. However, tread carefully because your incurable optimism could lead you to misjudge the situation. There's no need to get in over your head today if you remember that you aren't actually a super-hero, even if others believe you are. A little humility keeps you from making promises you can't keep."
capricorn,2014-02-16,"Others might not see your visionary side now, but you are probably dreaming big these days, nonetheless. Paradoxically, you may be quite busy today fantasizing about your long-term goals in a very practical way. Reach for the stars; don't hold back once you have calculated all the risks. Even if you aren't feeling especially lucky at this time, you have an uncanny sense for playing the odds and coming out a winner."
aquarius,2014-02-16,"Although you may be quite enthusiastic today, you still could find it challenging to fully participate as part of a team. You are feeling somewhat reclusive now and might benefit from working solo or relaxing alone for a while. Clarify your goals and continue moving toward them, but don't waste time trying to explain every step you take. Talk is cheap; actions almost always speak louder than words."
pisces,2014-02-16,"It's complicated to meet the expectations of your closest friends today because you may not be willing to commit as much of your time as they want. Their actions might annoy you or they could simply ask too many questions now. You don't have the patience for endless logical analysis. Instead, you're ready to jump into your day and figure things out as you go. Follow your intuition, but don't forget to fall back on your common sense if you get lost."
aries,2014-02-17,"Although you may spend much of the day hard at work, the action picks up this afternoon as you become more socially inclined. Whether you go out on the town with friends or relax at home with family, at least try to include others in your plans. But don't get caught in a web of procrastination. If you complete whatever tasks you start as efficiently as possible, you will have more alternatives for pleasure available later on."
taurus,2014-02-17,"Acting in a kind manner is admirable, but obsessing over what makes the most sense can interfere with your overall efficiency. Your current tendency may be to analyze everything too much before making your move. Unfortunately, by the time you finally make up your mind, you might have already run out of options. Instead of worrying about whether to work or play today, just do what comes naturally without bothering with the extra analysis. No one can fault you for being yourself."
gemini,2014-02-17,"Staying home and taking it easy might be too tempting of an idea to resist today. You may be so eager to have fun that you agree to something that really isn't ultimately in your best interest. But playing hooky from work or school isn't a smart idea at all, especially if it damages your reputation. Pay close attention to what you must sacrifice in order to fulfill your desires. If the cost is too high, don't say yes."
cancer,2014-02-17,"There are simple steps you can take today to bring your life back into harmony. However, your needs are likely to be very different from those close to you now and the sooner you acknowledge what you want, the better it will be for all involved. Talking about your passions will help move the energy, as long as you don't expect one heartfelt discussion to resolve everything all at once. Remember, the real answers are likely to be found within."
leo,2014-02-17,"Using your common sense is often a reliable way to help you make the best decisions, but today it may be smarter to take a risk with a less than practical idea. You might start out thinking that your feet are on the ground only to discover that your head is in the clouds by the time evening rolls around. Even if others try to change your mind, listen to your intuition and follow your heart."
virgo,2014-02-17,"You have a love-hate relationship today with the same things that usually keep you happily occupied. You may grow bored with your normal work routine now and might try to shake up the regularity of your life by doing things differently. As much as this act of rebellion can be liberating, don't be afraid to fall back on the tried and true methods if the new ones are not as effective as you had hoped. There's no harm in experimenting as long as you have a safety net in place."
libra,2014-02-17,Tie up as many loose ends as you can before the Moon slips into your sign this afternoon. But don't try to make a big deal out of everything you do. It's not for anyone else that you need to finish what you started; it's to prepare yourself for the emotional whirlwind that arrives tomorrow. You might be too distracted to fully concentrate on the future if you still have unfinished business on your plate.
scorpio,2014-02-17,"You might be feeling under pressure to finally address unresolved dynamics in your home or family. However, don't get yourself so worked up now that your happiness depends upon resolution of issues that still require additional work. You are entering an intermediate zone where you can't go back to the way things were, yet you can't move forward either. Take a few deep breaths and cut yourself some slack. There's no exact timetable for the healing of the heart."
sagittarius,2014-02-17,"Initiating action on your big ideas may have to wait until tomorrow, because previous promises must be fulfilled before you take on even more responsibilities. Unfortunately, you could frivolously waste time this morning, especially if you are slow to get started with your tasks at work. Don't be afraid to push yourself a little harder so you can be satisfied with a job well done by the end of the day."
capricorn,2014-02-17,"You want to be appreciated and admired for your competence on the job. Ironically, you may need to set aside your personal agenda today to gain the recognition you crave, whether it's solving a problem at work, hosting a party or just being there for someone special. Rather than seeking approval from your friends or coworkers, put in the extra effort now just because it makes you feel good."
aquarius,2014-02-17,"Taking an extra step toward a pleasurable goal might seem like a great idea now, but you still could end up disappointed if your needs aren't fully met. Thankfully, there's enough working in your favor that it's easy to believe you'll eventually obtain what you want. Unfortunately, your progress may slow down the closer you get to satisfaction. Don't try too hard or you could become obsessed about what you don't have rather than simply being grateful for what's already yours."
pisces,2014-02-17,"A paradoxical twist may be added to the mix this week as your feelings deepen while you simultaneously grow more emotionally detached. You might feel anxious at first if you aren't able to lose yourself into your dreamworld as easily as usual. Instead of worrying about the current state of affairs, be thankful that you can now sink into a challenging dilemma without necessarily being overwhelmed by the situation. Use both your head and your heart to navigate through these tumultuous waters and emerge stronger than before."
aries,2014-02-18,"You might feel as if a cycle is coming to a close, but you're just being called to finish up old business so you're ready for the upcoming action. Hopefully, you haven't climbed too far out on any limbs lately. However, don't be too hard on yourself if you have to spend time cleaning up after your overly impulsive behavior. Although you may prefer reminiscing about recent events today, do whatever is necessary to prepare for what's just around the corner. Don't waste this chance to make progress while you can."
taurus,2014-02-18,"A significant shift is occurring in your life, prompting you to look further off into the distance. Unfortunately, this can be a bit nerve-racking now since your ultimate goals may not synchronize with your current trajectory. You might convince yourself that drastic action is required to get back onto the path that will lead you toward your desired future. Seriously consider your options, but don't push too hard for change yet. Make your move only when you're good and ready."
gemini,2014-02-18,"A thorough reevaluation of your career objectives may be in order now that the Sun is moving through your 10th House of Professional Responsibility. Think about what steps you need to take to put your life on a faster track to success. You might not feel a major shift yet, but that doesn't make your process any less unimportant. You could regret it if you let this chance slip by without trying to accomplish something tangible. Thankfully, making a commitment to follow a certain path can bring your dreams to fruition sooner than you expect."
cancer,2014-02-18,"The current cosmic dynamics are subtle today so you might not feel incredibly full of energy. However, you certainly deserve the emotional boost that is coming your way. You're beginning to feel more comfortable with yourself and are willing to hold tight to whatever position is necessary to maintain your integrity. Your ideals are high and your vision is wide; walk your talk and see who follows."
leo,2014-02-18,"You may appreciate the positive side of the changes in your immediate environment, even if a part of you still wants to hold onto the status quo. You might even attempt to gloss over any negative comments that you receive today. This is not a time to respond in a cavalier manner because your current reactions are probably more important than you think. Listen to what people have to say. Don't run away from the truth; accepting the feedback as constructive guidance rather than criticism now could help you reach your goals in a timely manner."
virgo,2014-02-18,"You could benefit from standing in front of a mirror today and reminding yourself of what you have accomplished since your last birthday. Set priorities and create goals for the balance of your year now as the Sun moves through your 7th House of Reflection. Once you are sure no one is watching, say whatever you need to pump up your self-esteem. Speak your truth right out loud. Then, go out and make your mark. You can do nearly anything if you put your mind to it."
libra,2014-02-18,"You are pretty pleased with yourself because you have been riding a wave of positive energy. But even if you're still benefiting from a recent creative streak, the cosmic vibrations are already beginning to shift. You now need to find ways to take what you've started and make it last. This is about establishing new routines in your life, but not any dull ones that take the joy out of your life. Anything goes, as long as it feels good and has some consistency to it."
scorpio,2014-02-18,"You may feel emotionally refreshed now that the radiant Sun is entering fellow water sign Pisces, though the improvement in your attitude might not seem apparent to others yet. This change is more about your internal psychology rather than your external presence. Vitality is returning to your imagination, replenishing your soul and soothing your emotions. Even if you have heavy responsibilities falling on your shoulders today, lighten your load by making time for creative play. Connecting with your inner child will do you a world of good."
sagittarius,2014-02-18,"You're running on mental overdrive now and thoroughly enjoying the buzz. Although the good times are not over, you have some deep thinking to do today that might make you wish you could escape from it all. Before you hop on a one-way flight to a tropical island, bite the bullet and deal with what's making you feel uncomfortable. Happily, you may not want to go anywhere once you uncover the source of your concerns. Sticking close to home is more enjoyable after you clear the air and make your peace."
capricorn,2014-02-18,"Although you tend to be ambitious and calculating once you establish a goal, you might be feeling rather confused today. Even if you have already done all the preparation you can, there may be a few surprises waiting for you along the way. Some of these unexpected twists and turns might surface now -- as if reality wants to see how you will react if it throws you a curve ball. You don't have to be perfect in your response; you simply need to give it your best possible effort to hit it out of the park."
aquarius,2014-02-18,"Over the past few weeks you have felt pressure to initiate change but you might finally get some relief now as the Sun leaves your sign and heads for the open seas of Pisces. However, it may take some time yet to see where the currents are carrying you. Don't waste energy worrying about your destination. Once you get your bearings, you can revise your plans as needed. In the meantime, sit back and enjoy the soothing ocean spray of gentle dreams that inspire your journey."
pisces,2014-02-18,"The light of awareness is shining into the dark recesses of your mind now. Your imagination is heightened and your fantasies are awakened. But you can't communicate your amazing visions to anyone else if your emotions block your self-expression. Don't fight against this resistance today. You'll only waste energy trying to climb over a wall that will soon crumble, anyhow. Instead, keep cultivating your colorful ideas without any interference; wait a few days before proudly presenting them to others."
aries,2014-02-19,"You are in your power zone, but you might unconsciously try to impose your will onto someone else. Remember that the Moon bumps into your key planet Mars today, sending your emotions into orbit. You're running on overdrive now, yet those around you may not be as ready for action as you are. Avoid unnecessary arguments by taking the needs of others into consideration before going on the attack. Channel your energy in a positive direction."
taurus,2014-02-19,"Someone might inadvertently stir up uncomfortable emotions today, perhaps reviving old feelings of unresolved anger. You're typically a down-to-earth person with a common sense attitude toward life. But you could be mixing up memories from your childhood with current circumstances, making it more difficult now to fix the present situation. Examine your past and then use the lessons learned to positively impact your future."
gemini,2014-02-19,"Others envy the ease with which clever thoughts roll off your tongue. You often can say what you want and be done with it. However, it might be more complicated now to separate your ideas and opinions from your identity. The problem is that if you are fully invested in your perspective, you may have to be more aggressive in your own defense. Just remember that everyone else has valid input to give as well. Keeping your mind open is more important than having the last word."
cancer,2014-02-19,"It might be tempting to convey your annoyance today by not saying or doing anything at all. Unfortunately, once you choose this passive-aggressive tactic, you may retreat so far back into your shell that no one can establish communication with you. Fight against the tendency to withdraw if you are feeling hurt or resentful. Instead, nurse your wounds by gently expressing your feelings without creating a drama. Others can't make things right if they don't know what's wrong."
leo,2014-02-19,"A new wave of restlessness sweeps through your life today, but you may not know how to put your feelings out on the table without upsetting an emotional applecart. Although you respect other people's perspectives, you might secretly believe that yours is more important. Instead of jumping up on your soapbox to fight your cause, it's healthier to find more productive ways to burn off your excess energy. Save your sermons for another day."
virgo,2014-02-19,There are serious issues stewing in your immediate environment now and it's to your advantage to minimize the negative energy. You might grow irritated with a friend or family member -- and your harsh criticism could make matters worse. Put your ego aside today and everyone will feel better all the way around. Choose your battles wisely; you can catch more flies with honey than vinegar if you try.
libra,2014-02-19,"Your world is rocking, yet the chaos begins to settle down later in the day. Nevertheless, you might feel one last kick of adrenaline today, so make the most of this frenetic energy. Setting your ideas into motion is essential now. You are drawing power from deep reserves but you must be willing to do the work in order to reap the rewards."
scorpio,2014-02-19,"Your personal motivation is very strong now, driving you to accomplish more than expected. Unfortunately, your unspoken need to excel can pose a danger, for you may inadvertently create conflict with others in your singular quest to achieve your current objectives. Keep in mind that your success doesn't have to come at the expense of anyone else. Even if your ego is telling you otherwise, there is always room for multiple winners."
sagittarius,2014-02-19,"You're riding an energetic high even if today's cosmic weather clouds your ability to clearly convey your feelings. You might believe you can accomplish whatever is necessary; your optimism is waving like a flag in the breeze. Unfortunately, you can't shake a lingering suspicion that there's something you're forgetting now. Give yourself permission to keep turning over recent events, one by one, until you find what you are missing."
capricorn,2014-02-19,"One of your ongoing concerns these days is how you can propel yourself toward your goals without pushing others too hard. Unfortunately, if you're overly bossy, even your allies tend to back away from you. You are riding an adrenaline rush now, but don't try to put out this internal fire. Use your moral compass to keep yourself on track while searching for a constructive outlet for your abundant energy."
aquarius,2014-02-19,"Your focus is shifting as you become more practical about your long-term goals and your career path. Partnerships at work can deepen, offering you the support you need to make a crucial decision. However, tensions may be stirred if there is discord lurking beneath the surface in a developing relationship. Nevertheless, it helps to get everyone's feelings out in the open. Compromise isn't the simplest path to follow, but it is the fastest route to  peace and harmony at this time."
pisces,2014-02-19,"It may not be so easy to just let go of a bad feeling since your emotions run very deep. Don't look for the fast fix today. Sometimes the real magic in a relationship stems from those differences that make each person unique. Respecting each other's belief systems sets the stage for building common ground instead of fighting over that which cannot be resolved. When all else fails, let love guide the way."
aries,2014-02-20,"Slowing down long enough to explore your feelings is often challenging because you're usually on to the next great thing before you're done processing the past. However, today you may not be so anxious to go anywhere at all. Simply luxuriate in the current moment, allowing time to wash away your worries and regrets. A simple change in perspective could significantly improve the quality of your life."
taurus,2014-02-20,"You might try to avoid extremely passionate people now because you believe they may overly complicate your life. However, someone who is willing to express his or her feelings could teach you a valuable lesson today. Although you're tempted to build a protective wall around you, this isolating strategy only makes you feel lonely. Even if you strive to be drama free in all your interactions, it's still wise to stay open to the powerful emotional connections that can enrich your world."
gemini,2014-02-20,"Sailing over turbulent waters without being overwhelmed by the intensity comes naturally to you. However, the power of the emotional currents may carry you into unfamiliar depths today. Struggling against the prevailing tides only wears you out, so relax and go along with the flow. There's no need to panic; just make your way back to familiar ground later on when there's less resistance. In the meantime, enjoy the ride while it lasts."
cancer,2014-02-20,"You may be concerned about surrendering to your feelings today, but a familiar sense of security surrounds you if you simply release your fears and remain present in the moment. Thankfully, there's no need to figure anything out now; the time for logical analysis has already passed. Luckily, you ocean-dwelling Crabs are equipped to breathe under water. Deep diving in the nutrient-rich waters of emotions is the most effective way to replenish your soul."
leo,2014-02-20,"Maintaining a sense of playfulness is tricky today because your primal emotions may raise serious flags. You might even wonder about the wisdom of your recent strategy if it hasn't brought you all the fulfillment you expected. But don't overreact and make drastic changes to your plans yet, since your perspective will continue to evolve in the weeks ahead. Even if you can't see things clearly now, you're likely to realize soon enough that everything is unfolding as it should. Trusting the process is the first step to reaching your dreams."
virgo,2014-02-20,"You're ready to make the best of an intense emotional situation now, even if your partner or friend doesn't subscribe to your preferred course of action. Although you may have been annoyed recently by someone's lack of commitment or follow through, you are prepared to do whatever is required to make your life a success. Thankfully, the lessons you're learning now ultimately increase your self-confidence and help to clarify your priorities."
libra,2014-02-20,"You're not necessarily thrilled about getting pulled into an emotional drama that you would rather avoid. However, it seems unlikely that you can outsmart fate now. Luckily, an unexpected encounter today could suddenly turn into the main event. Instead of minimizing your needs to make others feel more important, focus on yourself for a change. Hold tight to your beliefs and don't let anyone lure you away from those things you value most. Maintain your integrity and everything should turn out for the best."
scorpio,2014-02-20,"Although a conversation could start out awkwardly today, there are many more topics of agreement than conflict. However, something still feels out of whack and you might not be able to stop digging until you reach the source of your concern. Fortunately, you don't have to find any answers right away. As long as you are moving in the right direction, you will have more time than you think to keep on searching."
sagittarius,2014-02-20,"You're gaining a whole new sense of purpose now, but it might be based on an intangible feeling rather than a pragmatic idea. Thankfully, you intuitively know what sounds right, yet you're uncertain how to manifest your dreams today. Don't push your current fantasies along too quickly; just revel in the idealistic meanderings and see where they take you. You can always circle around and create a concrete plan to reflect your colorful vision later on."
capricorn,2014-02-20,"You might be wondering about the possibility of taking a little spiritual retreat today, but you can't just run out on your responsibilities. Nevertheless, it's nearly impossible to resist the many interesting temptations you encounter. You may grow frustrated if you spin your wheels without accomplishing what you promised. Do your best to stay focused on your obligations and leave your dreams of a  mini-holiday for another day. The rewards are much sweeter if you do the work first."
aquarius,2014-02-20,"Your finances continue to be a dominant theme these days and, thankfully, you're more than willing to take care of business now. However, all your good intentions may not be enough to put your books in order right away. Whatever you do, don't fall for your own simplistic solutions or unrealistic hopes. Instead, build a solid plan and then set it into motion today. Just be sure to allow sufficient time for tangible results to manifest."
pisces,2014-02-20,"Your energy level is sky high today, making it imperative to do something productive before your stamina starts to wane. Additionally, setting the right tone for the coming month is crucial because you are tapped into your creative spirit now. Don't wait; although it might feel as if everything is taking longer to fall into place than you prefer, this is still a great time to clarify your dreams and start making them come true."
aries,2014-02-21,"You want to charge ahead today as if you know exactly where you're going and the quickest way to get there. Unfortunately, you might not have a clue. Your enthusiasm can be quite convincing, even to yourself. But in your excitement you could easily miss a crucial piece of the puzzle that's right in front of your nose. Slow down and you will have a better chance of getting it right the first time around."
taurus,2014-02-21,"Participating in a public disagreement is not your idea of a good time and you will do nearly anything to avoid verbal confrontation. However, someone could push you too far today. It's even more difficult to sidestep conflict now because you might not see it coming. Nevertheless, if you feel backed into a corner, stand up for yourself; don't let anyone prevent you from trying to reach your goals."
gemini,2014-02-21,"You might think you have all the answers today, but putting yourself up on a pedestal won't garner the support you seek. No one likes it when you get carried away with your superiority, so don't bother showing off your intellectual finesse. It's a smarter idea to simply listen to what others are telling you now. It won't hurt to hear the truth, especially if you can apply what you learn to improve your overall game."
cancer,2014-02-21,"A relationship issue can become a burden today if a slight difference of opinion heats up into an emotionally charged encounter. One of you may respond with a detached logical argument, which in turn, makes the other person even angrier. No one emerges as a winner if the discussion turns competitive or condescending. Instead of fighting to establish who's right, take a deep breath and assume that both of you have something important to offer. Your willingness to compromise cultivates common ground."
leo,2014-02-21,"Normally, you have no problem telling others when they have overstepped their boundaries. Although someone may be overly assertive today, it might take you so long to realize what's happening that it's too late to stop it. Understanding your role in letting something go too far is only the first step to improving the situation. Calmly addressing the matter now can put things back in a place that's acceptable to you. Be kind yet firm while reclaiming your territory."
virgo,2014-02-21,"It may feel as if the possibility of reaching a goal is slipping away and it's hard to know which way to turn next. But it's not just one particular situation that has you confused. Rather, the dissonance between your intellect and emotions seems to permeate everything these days. There's nowhere in your outer world that offers you the peaceful sanctuary you seek. For now, find solace in your dreams. Things will make more sense tomorrow."
libra,2014-02-21,"You have a creative strategy for spending your money wisely now, but someone you love might disagree with your plans. Or, perhaps you are internally conflicted because logic tells you one thing while your intuition says something else. But it's not about choosing one modality over the other. Instead, it's about honoring both your head and your heart. Thankfully, there's no need to decide today."
scorpio,2014-02-21,"You are ready to voice your opinions today and defend your beliefs. But putting your thoughts into words might be more challenging than you imagine. Ideally, you should be able to just live out your truth rather than having to talk about it. But others want you to share your experiences now, even if you prefer to keep them private. You don't have to reveal everything all at once. Start slowly and speak from your heart."
sagittarius,2014-02-21,"Indulging yourself might sound like a good idea today because you are eager for fun and there's no time like the present moment. However, achieving satisfaction isn't as simple as it sounds. Circumstances shift throughout the day and befuddle your desire to make your escape. You will be happier once you let go of control and temporarily give up your party plans. Fulfill your obligations before following your bliss."
capricorn,2014-02-21,"You could be struggling with two opposing sides of your nature today. On one hand, your long-term goals seem more important than ever and you may get lost in pursuit of them. On the other hand, there's so much happening in your everyday world that it's hard to think of anything in the future. Nevertheless, don't minimize the significance of your dreams. Juggling the here and now with the then and there isn't always easy, but it's your most sensible strategy for now."
aquarius,2014-02-21,You have a much better chance of getting what you want now if you don't share everything that's on your mind with everyone you meet. Being too expressive of your feelings may frighten away someone special because you can come on stronger than you intend. Underplaying your hand is a wise move today. Things should go your way as long as you exhibit some self-restraint.
pisces,2014-02-21,"Discerning what's real is tricky because your fantasies are so vivid now that they seep through the filter separating night from day. In fact, you could be so entangled in your own dreams that you accidentally lead yourself down the wrong path. There's nothing wrong with sinking into the magic of the subconscious world. But remember, you'll need to make up for lost time and take care of unfinished business when you wake up next week."
aries,2014-02-22,"Your idealism may sow the seeds of conflict as you pull away from others to do your own thing today. But even if tension is brewing, it could escape your notice because you're likely too wrapped up in thinking about the exciting possibilities ahead. There's no reason to lower the volume of your dreams as long as you also remain aware of those around you. A little sensitivity goes a long way to foster a peaceful and harmonious environment."
taurus,2014-02-22,"You might believe that everyone knows how you are feeling today; however, your actions could prove quite misleading. Take plenty of time to collect your thoughts so you can be especially clear when expressing your emotions. Unfortunately, the one minor detail that slips through the cracks could turn into a major problem. The best solution is prevention, so be aware of how your words may be interpreted before you speak. Knowing your audience sets you up for success."
gemini,2014-02-22,"You aren't quite as sharp as you want to be today, especially if others are relying on you for the facts. You're motivated more by compassion and beauty now than by logic and details. This current penchant for fantasy can make for a lovely escape, especially if you share your visions with a friend. However, something as straightforward as giving someone driving directions might be a chore unless you consciously concentrate on each step of the task at hand. Let your imagination take you on a magical mystery tour instead."
cancer,2014-02-22,"Your current optimism could leave others dissatisfied if you can't deliver on your promises. Nevertheless, don't seek guidance from anyone else now because friends and family will probably just encourage you to take on even more work. Instead of saying yes, reassess how much effort must go into every little job you consider doing. Making a more realistic decision is less stressful on everyone involved. Simplify your strategy for the best results."
leo,2014-02-22,"You might be able to float through the day as if a dream from the previous night continues after you get out of bed. Unfortunately, you're likely to discover that your imagination can land you in a heap of trouble if you don't separate fact from fiction. Maintaining a positive attitude is usually a smart tactic, but avoiding the harsher side of reality early in the day may elicit an unpleasant wake-up call later. Acknowledge things as they are and not as you wish them to be."
virgo,2014-02-22,"You may entertain unconventional ideas about your health these days, encouraging you to examine alternative possibilities outside the mainstream. Your imagination is especially strong now, making you highly susceptible to suggestion. If you believe an unusual remedy is effective, it probably will work. Whether you are attracted to acupuncture, flower remedies or yoga, don't expect fast results. However, the power of positive thought might just pull you through when you need it most."
libra,2014-02-22,"You may be struck with wanderlust today as you dream of going somewhere special -- but heading to the other side of town isn't enough to satisfy your appetite. You want to go the distance now, perhaps a romantic getaway to an exotic tropical island or a spiritual journey to a foreign land. Still, you're not likely to go as far as your mind can take you. In fact, it doesn't even matter if you never leave the house since you can find plenty of joy traveling within the vast realms of your imagination."
scorpio,2014-02-22,"Finding new ways to express your independence can become an obsession today but, paradoxically, you might not want to stray too far from your home base. Circumstances are nowhere near normal these days, and your desire for adventure may simply be a reaction to emotional pressures or family responsibilities. Either way, taking care of personal business should come before staging any quick escapes. Nothing is gained by acting like a rebel without a cause."
sagittarius,2014-02-22,"Behaving in an overly emotional manner isn't your usual style, but expressing your feelings clearly today just might help you get what you want. You could be worried that an opportunity is passing too quickly and that you won't be able to make the most of it. Don't worry; a seed has been planted, even if nothing appears to be growing yet. Water your plans with your dreams and fertilize them with positive vibrations and hard work."
capricorn,2014-02-22,"Postpone important financial decisions if you can today because your normally conservative thinking may be hampered by unrealistic dreams. A great moneymaking scheme that looks lucrative on the surface will probably turn out less practical than it seems now. Rather than attempting to be fiscally responsible, give yourself permission to temporarily postpone the inevitable. Be patient with yourself, for your clarity will return after the weekend."
aquarius,2014-02-22,"Although you might place high expectations on yourself today, it's really an ideal time for a bit of good, old-fashioned fun. Plan a little escape, even if it's only a trip to the movies. Any sort of retreat from your daily routine is productive in the long run, since you desperately need to recharge your batteries. It's not about how much you accomplish now; it's about replenishing your soul."
pisces,2014-02-22,"If you have a musical instrument stashed away, it may be time to dig it out and give it a whirl. Or, maybe you need to pick up the camera that's been sitting on your shelf and snap a few pictures. Try anything that puts you in touch with your creative muse. However, don't bother to explain your behavior to anyone else today. This cosmic energy is about making inner connections and not about outer rationalizations."
aries,2014-02-23,"Your goals feel very close when you believe your vision is clear. This may seem like such a pivotal moment, but there is a warning that comes along with this good news. Your ambitions could be built upon your most optimistic assessment of a situation -- and you might not be taking all the information into consideration. Don't close off communication just because you think it will bring you down. In fact, sharing your ideas can help you put your dreams into proper perspective."
taurus,2014-02-23,"Your imagination may be running wild today, especially with respect to where your long-term goals might take you. Trust your instincts and move into the great unknown, but don't let yourself fall completely into the realms of fantasy. Anchor your ambitions to the real world where seeing is believing. Finding the right mix of logic and intuition produces the best results."
gemini,2014-02-23,"The clouds have dissipated and the sky is blue, but it's hard to know if you're seeing the truth. Your first inclination is to use your enthusiasm to channel your energy into more socially responsible work. On the other hand, your current surge of hope also encourages you to connect with your inner visionary artist, musician or poet. Just remember, as your spirit soars high above the mundane world, don't lose sight of the ground. Sooner or later, you will need to land and it's wise to have your bearings when you do."
cancer,2014-02-23,"You might be inspired to embark on a metaphysical adventure now, delving into the non-physical dimensions of reality. Perhaps you may be drawn to journey into realms of science fiction or act out your fantasies in a role-playing game. Luckily, a growing interest in psychology can pull you into the mysteries of consciousness. Ultimately, you have an opportunity to find the personal meaning that has eluded you in the past. Remain open to being surprised by something you learn."
leo,2014-02-23,"Even if you can normally count on your friends, they might seem a bit flakey today. Nevertheless, they may only be reflecting your need to express your own creativity. Don't try to pigeonhole anyone by placing too many expectations on them now. Honor the magical meanderings of others as personal spiritual gifts. Accept the intuitive messages gratefully, but don't take what someone tells you  as the ultimate truth. You must discover that for yourself."
virgo,2014-02-23,"Your current dilemma may reach its maximum tipping point today. You want to be as responsible as others see you. But your dreams are louder than normal now, and you really shouldn't shut them off when they have so much to offer. Your creative fantasies aren't easily integrated into your daily routine, but you can still grow in unexpected ways if you temporarily set logic aside while you travel in the limitless realms of your imagination."
libra,2014-02-23,"Escaping from the commitments you already made is nearly impossible, but you will gain more from the day if you can also find time to cultivate your inner voice of creativity. Whatever modes of self-expression are normally productive for you are even more powerful today. You are riding an artistic streak now and it would be a shame to miss the opportunity to capture this inspirational energy. This cosmic wave is for you."
scorpio,2014-02-23,"Your dreams may be time traveling back into the past as you dredge up childhood memories and sort through your family's history. Your feelings are quite intense, making it difficult to separate truth from fantasy today. You can paint a rosy picture from an experience that wasn't very pretty at all. Or, you can choose to delude yourself with negativity based on false illusions. Either way, be careful about confusing your anxiety with reality. Thankfully, forgiveness has the power to transform fear into love."
sagittarius,2014-02-23,You could make most anything appear better than it actually is now that the emotional Moon is traveling through your 1st House of Personality. It's just that your natural way with words is augmented by your passionate feelings today. But don't worry about communicating the details; the real action is currently at the conceptual level. Just make sure that what you're saying is based on the truth so you can motivate yourself as well as others to accomplish great things.
capricorn,2014-02-23,"Your life grows more confusing when you let your feelings out to play, especially if you're uncertain about how to integrate them into the rest of your life. You do know one thing for sure -- and that's the importance of your imagination, even if you don't fully trust it. However, the show must go on today. You might believe you have a vested interest in what happens, but you'll be happier if you dance like no one's watching and not worry about the outcome."
aquarius,2014-02-23,"You may inadvertently steer others wrong today, but they might go along with your schemes no matter what you say. It seems as if people are encouraging your idealism -- and maybe they are. But it's more like the blind leading the blind. Fortunately, this energetic melodrama isn't nearly as bad as it sounds. Take a deep breath and accept the fact that you're being guided by a higher power now. Your judiciously placed trust will soon be rewarded. Faith moves mountains but you first must believe."
pisces,2014-02-23,"You Fish are often considered to be the champions of imagination, even though you might call it by another name. You are more attracted to the fantasy realms, possibly making your mundane existence seem dull and uninteresting now. Nevertheless, be careful about escaping into your own dream world today. Even if the colors are brighter, they won't last as long. Rely on your friends to give you a reality check to keep you from drifting too far off into another dimension."
aries,2014-02-24,"Obstacles you encounter now probably stem from something you haven't shared yet. The most obvious solution is to come clean by being as direct as possible, although this strategy of radical honesty can lead to other problems. Not everyone wants to hear the truth. Nevertheless, handling the consequences of your current disclosures is easier than shadow boxing with an enemy you cannot see."
taurus,2014-02-24,"You might have a tough time dealing with the lessons of love you must learn now that your key planet Venus is receiving a stern message from authoritative Saturn. Luckily, you're aspiring toward a life that is based upon truth and not on fantasy because you prefer the safety of long-term stability. If something enjoyable captures your attention today, savor the excitement for a while and then choose a more conservative route. True satisfaction is worth the wait."
gemini,2014-02-24,"You are feeling quite grounded today, even if your fantasies lure you away from your work. You have an excellent sense of balance now, enabling you to meet your obligations in a responsible manner while still having a bit of fun. Of course, there are rules to follow and you need to restrain from going too far with any indulgence. Thankfully, being content with what you currently have in your life is the quickest path to personal fulfillment."
cancer,2014-02-24,"You may be so skillful at controlling your mood swings today that you're able to sidestep an unpleasant meltdown. You intuitively know what works best and you can modify your actions and words to produce the results you want. Since sweet Venus' hookup with taskmaster Saturn could trigger feelings of low self-esteem, be sure that you speak with love in your heart instead of fear. Your positive energy will be reflected back at you in ways you can't imagine."
leo,2014-02-24,"Although you don't want to blur the distinction between what's real and what's not, you still could be a bit worried about your mental meanderings today. The overlap is subtle, but you might even try to convince yourself that your fantasies are true now. There's nothing wrong with your beliefs as long as you don't expect everyone to accept your truth as theirs. Focus on achieving your goals but keep your heart open to love."
virgo,2014-02-24,"If a friend or partner appears to be out of touch with reality today, it may be prudent to respond with support instead of judgment. Even if you don't think that others have taken the best course of action, try to understand what's motivating them or your negativity could damage the friendship. On the other hand, you can consciously choose to expand your awareness, encouraging the relationship to deepen and grow."
libra,2014-02-24,"You are tempted to make changes in your daily exercise routine or in your diet based upon wanting a healthier lifestyle. However, you might realize that seeking a spiritual answer isn't the best way to make progress on this front. Instead, look for ways to add excitement into your life without turning it upside down. Being creative while working within the limitations of your current circumstances can bring more stability at this time than any other approach."
scorpio,2014-02-24,"Living in the present moment may sound like a great idea unless you have other long-term responsibilities that just cannot be ignored today. Use your creative imagination to envision your ideal future, but keep yourself anchored to your current financial and emotional commitments. Thankfully, this current safety line can prevent you from making a disruptive choice. Explore all your options before deciding what to do next; you're not in as much of a hurry as you think."
sagittarius,2014-02-24,"Your anxieties may surface now, yet you can't force the process to speed up just to suit your needs. The current restraints feel rather inconvenient, especially if you would prefer to ignore them and move on. Nevertheless, an emotional conflict still could heat up and sidetrack your day. Do whatever you can to alleviate the pressure, since it will likely take several more days to resolve."
capricorn,2014-02-24,"Waves of joy may wash on to the shores of your awareness today, but you might not be able to feel the unrestrained ecstasy. Your key planet Saturn is moderating the pleasure principle of Venus, helping you extend the good times so they last longer. Use your positive attitude to build a strong foundation for future experiences. There's no rush, so give your plans a while longer to mature and develop."
aquarius,2014-02-24,"You have a very down-to-earth approach to managing your intense emotions now. Responsible Saturn is your traditional ruling planet and its supportive alignment with resourceful Venus brings you a sweet sense of satisfaction today. You feel good about the work you are doing so don't sit around idly, waiting for something momentous to happen. Convert your determination into action. You don't need to know all the details yet about where you are going; just start moving."
pisces,2014-02-24,"Ironically, your trustworthy allies may seem to thwart your plans now, but paradoxically they can do it in such a way that actually makes you more successful. There is no need to resist the criticism that you receive if you simply accept that there's always room for improvement. But don't waste your energy feeling discouraged by short-term setbacks; instead, focus on developing your long-term plans and making them even better than before."
aries,2014-02-25,"Improving your chances of manifesting your dreams is simple today if you're smart enough to practice patience. But waiting for the right opportunity is not an excuse to do nothing at all. Relaxing for a while is fine, but being lazy when you have so much to do is not in your best interest. Establishing a steady pace early in the day helps you get enough of your most critical chores out of the way so you can think about the bigger picture later on."
taurus,2014-02-25,"You may be obsessing about a getaway now that the Moon is hooking up with relentless Pluto in your 9th House of Journeys. If you have been dreaming about going somewhere exotic, this is a perfect time to continue your exploration of the possibilities. Making plans for a future adventure is a great idea because you are able to deftly balance fantasy with reality now. Visualize all the alternatives and then choose the path that makes the most sense based on what you learn."
gemini,2014-02-25,"You could be so busy now that you lose touch with your own emotions. However, taking on a little less work might allow your feelings to rise into awareness. Try not to start any new projects and put all non-essential communication on hold for a couple of days. Although developing a fresh perspective may create anxiety at first, the positive outcome makes all the trouble worthwhile. Listening to your heart is the first step to lasting satisfaction."
cancer,2014-02-25,"You might have a tough time expressing your love toward someone who wants more attention from you. You could even decide to withdraw for a while, yet others don't necessarily realize that you're coming from a place of good intentions. Although you may actually be afraid of getting too close, you also don't want to bother anyone with your shortcomings or doubts. Nevertheless, rationally facing your fears gives you a chance to break through an emotional barrier and deepen existing relationships."
leo,2014-02-25,"Your health may be compromised now as you battle a cold or deal with a minor infection. Even if you are feeling great, it's still wise to make some kind of improvement to your current exercise program. And if you've recently thought about making a change in your diet, don't wait for a better time. Establishing new routines that increase your physical strength has a powerfully positive impact on your overall well-being."
virgo,2014-02-25,"Managing your schedule with a creative flair gives you a much-needed advantage for the next few days. Of course, you still must take care of your previous obligations, but with a little foresight you can find time for play while the Moon is lighting up your 5th House of Fun and Games. Your life is not just about being the most responsible one in the room. Whatever you do for enjoyment -- whether engaging in sports, social activities or hobbies -- make sure that you leave time to replenish your soul."
libra,2014-02-25,"You might have to pay extra attention to a family matter today. Thankfully, the problem isn't earth-shattering, but domestic responsibilities can still get in the way of other more enjoyable commitments. Don't complain about what you must do; just prioritize your tasks and get started right away. You'll be pleasantly surprised that with the right amount of determination you can finish nearly everything in less time than you thought possible. A positive attitude only helps to make the work more pleasurable along the way."
scorpio,2014-02-25,"Taking care of unfinished business is a smart plan today, especially if you have been procrastinating for too long. The practical Capricorn Moon is visiting your 3rd House of Communication, so write those emails and make those phone calls needed to handle a lingering issue. Tying up loose ends requires concentration and commitment; however, you will surely feel good about your efforts once the day is over."
sagittarius,2014-02-25,"You may receive an unexpected benefit today from taking a risk and sharing your concerns with a friend about a personal failure or a disappointment. The supportive feedback you receive can cast your situation in a whole new light. The information you glean isn't radically different; it's just that you are more open to hearing the truth now. Paradoxically, expressing your vulnerability can ultimately improve your self-esteem and validate your trust in others."
capricorn,2014-02-25,"Although you may be confident in your ability to accomplish your objectives today, you could find yourself in trouble if you take on more responsibilities than you can manage. If you're not sure how much effort a task requires, talk it over with a coworker or friend before saying yes. Being self-assured enough to push your limits is admirable, but for now be as practical as possible. Setting clear boundaries earns you even more respect."
aquarius,2014-02-25,"Don't be too hard on yourself if reality feels somewhat boring today. Your current dreams are bigger than life, but they're not necessarily a distraction. In fact, your fantasies may be your best ticket to understanding the future. You can explore alternative life paths by visualizing your future self right in the middle of the picture. Trust your intuition; let your mind wander now and create your strategy later."
pisces,2014-02-25,"It doesn't necessarily feel like work if you're helping someone you love today. You may even be willing to go beyond the call of duty now. And although you might feel pleased about what you are doing for others, it's crucial that you don't go overboard. Taking your role as a superhero too seriously can leave you physically exhausted and emotionally depleted. Just remember to reserve some of your nurturing and pampering for yourself."
aries,2014-02-26,"No matter how confident you are about your future prospects, your long-term goals may seem just beyond your grasp today. Normally, this delay might be discouraging but you're actually eager now to work around the current obstacles. Don't expect immediate solutions; however, if you already laid the foundation for deeper changes, they could begin to unfold in the days ahead. Determination and patience is an unbeatable combination."
taurus,2014-02-26,"You may be flying on the wings of optimism today, yet it's wise to bring yourself back down to earth before too long. Thankfully, you're as comfortable with your feet on the ground as anyone, so your newly established stability is quite satisfying at first. Nevertheless, you might begin to sense that something isn't quite right. Don't get carried away trying to get to the bottom of a mystery; instead of looking back, just keep moving forward. The missing pieces will fall into place when the time is right."
gemini,2014-02-26,"You're seeking excitement in your life, but first you must deal with a difficult situation. Someone may be making demands on you or, perhaps, responsibilities at work are piling up. Either way, your attitude makes the difference between failure and success. Act with confidence while going through the motions the best you can. Responding with finesse to the current pressures helps you to establish a stable center. Once you have gained your balance, you'll be ready for the next adventure."
cancer,2014-02-26,"It seems as if everyone is encouraging you to do things that push you right up against your limits today. On one hand, you're excited about the potential breakthrough. On the other hand, you may be quite satisfied with the status quo. Unfortunately, the effort you put into resistance now will likely take its toll, making you even more anxious. This is an opportune time for change; you have a much better chance of reaching your goals if you remain open to the possibilities of the moment."
leo,2014-02-26,"You may feel bent out of shape today because obligations push you one way while your need for freedom pulls you another. Unfortunately, a quick solution might not be forthcoming. Nevertheless, the current stress won't have long-term consequences unless you stir something up that's better left alone for now. Just grin and bear it for a day or two until the tension settles down. Ironically, your negativity could dissipate once you simply choose to go with the flow."
virgo,2014-02-26,"Confusing circumstances seem to get in the way of your high hopes for meaningful dialogue today. There are so many topics you want to talk about as your emotions bump up against the reality of your current relationships. But even if the resistance appears to originate from someone else, look within to see how you have contributed to establishing the distance. Increasing your self-awareness helps soften the boundaries over the days ahead. Take the high road and open your heart."
libra,2014-02-26,"It's not that you are required to keep anything secret now; it's just that you don't want to reveal all of your feelings at once. Your heightened sense of intensity may scare someone away today, creating an effect very different from your intentions. As you struggle with the inevitable changes that are unfolding in your relationships, you might just discover that you have more power than you thought. Lead by example and let love be your guide."
scorpio,2014-02-26,"Your willingness to examine your hidden motives can ease the stress in your life as long as you are able to let go of the past. The Moon and retrograde Mercury are both in your 4th House of Roots, prompting you to dig deeply into your own personal history in search for present meaning. But self-doubt isn't useful; if your current life falls short of old expectations now, don't project your insecurities onto anyone else. Be fearless, take a risk and boldly move into your future. The journey of a lifetime begins with one single step."
sagittarius,2014-02-26,"You are justifiably concerned about adhering to your schedule now, even if it might make more sense to ease up on the controls and adapt to the changing circumstances. Although you're eager for an adventure into the unknown as radical Uranus squares your key planet Jupiter, there is still room for miscalculations, misunderstandings and bad judgments. Carefully define the assumptions and agreements of any relationship or contract. Don't try to hide your uncertainty by pretending you know all the answers; for the best results, just be yourself."
capricorn,2014-02-26,"You might not be ready for the good news that arrives today. Although someone may offer you an exciting opportunity, it also has the potential of destabilizing your life. If you believe that you already have all the facts, you could appear overconfident when you make your decision. It's possible to become a casualty of your own ambition now if you don't temper it with a healthy dose of common sense. Slow down; it's better to arrive at success late with a smile on your face than not at all."
aquarius,2014-02-26,"Your world is tense with anticipation today. The possibilities seem endless, maybe even overwhelming. And it's challenging to find the best speed at which to move ahead, because you don't want to mess things up. But sitting idly with your foot on the brake won't clear your way to success. Handle the current resistance by confronting it directly. However, don't exhaust yourself now by trying to accomplish too much too fast. The future will arrive on time, even if it takes a bit longer to manifest your dreams."
pisces,2014-02-26,"You might feel as if it's daybreak and your dreams have receded into a hidden corner of your mind. However, there's no cause for worry today since the brilliance of illumination can shine a bright new light on your life. Ingenious ideas that pop into awareness are more likely now to have lasting value. Write down any inspirations that surface right away, so you can develop them over the days ahead."
aries,2014-02-27,"Your friends and associates show up in unexpected ways today, making life easier for you. With their assistance, you're able to solve nearly any problem, even those that have plagued you for a while. In turn, you can lend your positive spirit to helping others or organizing social activities. Host an event or jump into a group discussion where you can interact with interesting people who are sharing intriguing ideas. For now, it really might take a village to fulfill all of your needs."
taurus,2014-02-27,"There's no reason to be too concerned if you're not fully appreciated at work today. In fact, it may not be the best time to ask for the recognition you deserve. Reflect carefully on the ramifications of your actions before stating your needs. You could be overly sensitive now, so it won't take much to stir self-doubt about your career aspirations. Nevertheless, it won't help your cause if you take things too personally. Keep a positive attitude; today's optimism leads to tomorrow's success."
gemini,2014-02-27,"Your inventive mind can take you nearly anywhere today; it's up to you to decide your destination. Although others may lift your spirits with their good ideas, don't spend time with people who are overly serious now. A lighthearted engagement is more consistent with your present frame of mind, so find someone who is witty enough to keep up with the intellectual games that you love so much. Just remember you can play until your heart's content, but at some point you're going to have to get down to business."
cancer,2014-02-27,"A bit of relationship drama is likely today because your emotions may be somewhat erratic. It's challenging to get a handle on the situation because you might not feel like you're standing on solid ground. The rules are in flux now, making this a poor time to hold onto the status quo. Be courageous and open your heart to new ways of connecting with others. Take a deep breath and prepare for positive change."
leo,2014-02-27,"Visitors may come and go unexpectedly, filling your day with surprises. There seems to be fewer limitations on how you communicate with others today, allowing for possible breakthroughs in relationships. If you believe the time is right, take a risk and say what's on your mind. Thankfully, you can create new rules for sharing your life with someone you trust; all it takes is a little imagination now and the confidence to move forward. Let your heart lead the way."
virgo,2014-02-27,"You're inspired today by an ingenious approach to a work project, a hobby or even a task at home. All you have to do is release the old and tired way of doing things to make room for new and improved ideas. Entertaining all possibilities prevents you from becoming bogged down in an unnecessary dispute. Remember, getting the job done now is more important than determining who's right."
libra,2014-02-27,"It's playtime today, whether you do something fun with kids or get in touch with your own inner child. Silly games, creative endeavors and romantic pursuits are all appropriate now as long as you allow yourself to bask in the pleasure of being alive. If you are under too much pressure, take a break to breathe deeply. Even a short walk will do you good. Anything that creates movement and gets oxygen into your lungs also brings fresh hope into your heart."
scorpio,2014-02-27,"An apparently unresolvable emotional issue may slow you down today. Surprisingly, you can see progress once you realize that you really do have more choices than you thought. You might not be thrilled with the current options, but any decision you make now is better than none at all. Ultimately, it's crucial to keep moving forward. Even if you're still unsure about your new direction, change for the sake of change will do you good."
sagittarius,2014-02-27,"Feed your current taste for unconventional activities now by stepping off the beaten track and exploring the territory outside your familiar haunts. Even if you're hesitant at first, once you get going you won't want to look back. Sweep away old cobwebs that have settled into your life by steering clear of worn-out patterns and people who don't have your best interests at heart. Out with the old and in with the new."
capricorn,2014-02-27,"Although you usually don't mind it when other people lean on you, it may be particularly annoying today. Others trust you because they assume you're not going to follow a crazy notion on a whim. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem fair that everyone else is free to be weird and off the wall while you are expected to be the stabilizing influence who holds down the fort. However, you might just surprise someone now by acting out of character in order to restore a bit of balance to the relationship dynamics. You deserve to have some fun, but don't rebel just to prove a point."
aquarius,2014-02-27,"You're probably feeling quite moody now that the emotional Moon is visiting your sign. You're itching for change and it may be difficult to restrain yourself with logic today. If you try to stay in the same old groove, something or someone is likely to come along to shake up your world. Ultimately, it's more exciting to pick your own adventure instead, so don't wait; break new ground now while you still have the chance. You can't go wrong if you follow your heart."
pisces,2014-02-27,"You may be able to see exactly what you want but it's as if you're standing outside a closed store, longing for what's on the other side of the window. There are so many enticing goodies and it's frustrating that you can't put your hands on them right away. But instead of getting hooked by the impossibility of the situation now, simply observe the images for future reference. Today you're planting seeds that will grow when you water them with positive actions later on."
aries,2014-02-28,"You feel kinder and gentler toward those you love today as the dreamy Pisces Moon encourages you to soften your hard edges. Even if you run into resistance, your charm should be enough to win nearly anyone over. Don't dwell on recent problems; you can let go of them for now. Whatever is crucial will resurface soon enough and you can deal with it then. All you need to worry about today is following your heart."
taurus,2014-02-28,"You're easily distracted by the idea of trying something out of the ordinary, yet your uncharacteristic enthusiasm may stir up more trouble than it's worth. It's possible to miss an important detail in your rush to create an opportunity for yourself. Since your current optimism has you believing that the silver lining is the most significant part of the dark cloud, you might ignore a problem instead of dealing with it in the moment. Seeking a realistic perspective is more useful than pretending everything is okay."
gemini,2014-02-28,"You are likely more concerned with the big picture than with the details today. Thankfully, your fantasies can be quite productive now, motivating you to take a calculated risk at work. Although you're currently riding an intuitive wave of optimism, don't lose sight of your common sense. A little dreaming is healthy, but don't expect too much change overnight. Be patient; determination could be your newest secret weapon."
cancer,2014-02-28,"You're on the hunt for an adventure today as the Sun harmonizes with expansive Jupiter in your sign. It's easy to appear happy when others are encouraging you, yet you still might have a more serious undertone to your behavior. Your intuitive understanding of what's happening can make you seem lucky, but anything that falls into your lap now has probably been hard-earned. Continue to aim high and reach for the stars."
leo,2014-02-28,"It's time to ride the waves of positive energy flowing through your life. Although you can be quite passionate about your current pet projects, remember not to overwhelm anyone who doesn't understand your excitement. Of course, you don't want to sit around waiting for the approval of others since you're eager to show the world what you have to offer. Sow your seeds today to reap great rewards in the future."
virgo,2014-02-28,"Although you might feel quite content with the status quo, you can still sense that big changes are in the air now. You have many wonderful ideas about how to add more pleasure into your day, making this an inconvenient time to let others dictate your needs. Don't hesitate; be precise about what would make your world better. If you ask clearly and have a sensible plan in mind, you might just get what you want."
libra,2014-02-28,"This is a wonderful time to channel your inner artist now, for your creativity can express your deepest feelings. But you must take the initiative to do something special with your talent or you will waste this auspicious moment. Seek more meaning by connecting personal experiences with larger patterns in your life. What others see as your luck may really be the result of how well you visualize the big picture. Don't let fear or doubt stop you from shining your light."
scorpio,2014-02-28,"If you are tired of feeling stuck in the same pattern, clarity is finally on the way as you begin to see possible solutions to your dilemma. You could have a sudden breakthrough in your creative process that guides you into new realms of consciousness. Don't waste time resisting the upcoming changes. The truths you discover now can propel you out of a familiar rut. The prevailing currents are heading your way, so prepare to let go and flow with them, wherever they carry you. It's not the destination, but the journey that counts."
sagittarius,2014-02-28,"The radiant Sun forms an emotionally rich trine with your ruling planet Jupiter today, bringing joy and temporary relief from the stresses and strains of modern living. Nevertheless, it's a smart idea to transform your current enthusiasm into positive action while it lasts. Your I-can-do-it attitude gives you the extra energy needed in order to accomplish all that you have promised. Don't hold back now; let your rising optimism take you as far as it possibly can. The sky is the limit."
capricorn,2014-02-28,"You tend to minimize your feelings because you typically distrust the unreliability of subjective thoughts. You would rather place your faith in concrete facts. However, today you can successfully tap into the emotional wisdom that you often dismiss. Your intuition is operating very keenly now so don't be afraid to listen to your inner voice, even if you cannot rationally justify what it tells you. Whatever you decide, make a commitment to focus your attention on what's most important to your heart."
aquarius,2014-02-28,"You may go through alternating mood swings today. One minute you are deep in emotional contemplation, remembering feelings from the past. The next minute you are distracting yourself from your memories by doing something practical in present time. Allowing your mind to freely move back and forth between these two extremes can ultimately help you see things with more clarity now. This is a rewarding exercise, but only if you make the effort to connect the past with what is happening in the current moment."
pisces,2014-02-28,"Your perceptions are so sharp today that others can't help but notice your acute sensitivity. But instead of shutting your senses down in order to cope with the intensity, it's more useful to fully engage them now. Don't lose precious time worrying about how people will react to your expressive behavior. Volunteer for community service, sign up for an environmental cause or just offer a helping hand to someone in need. Anything that moves you out of your head and out into the world is a sign of healthy progress."
aries,2014-03-01,"You are embarking on a journey into the mysterious shadows of your subconscious as your imagination lures you into places you've never been. Today's Pisces New Moon falls in your 12th House of Destiny, setting you off in a new direction. Things are beginning to change, but you may not notice the consequences of your current actions for a while because your key planet Mars enters its retrograde phase now. Trusting your emotions over logic enables you to uncover your personal truth."
taurus,2014-03-01,"Being sensibly cautious is preferable now because it enables you to communicate effectively. However, the Pisces New Moon highlights your 11th House of Community, magnifying your current tendency to go overboard, especially when you're in the company of a large group of people. But don't overstate your case because others will understand your message without any extra effort on your part. The simpler you make your story, the more impact it has."
gemini,2014-03-01,"Set aside unfinished projects that aren't coming to fruition yet, unless you can quickly wrap up loose ends and get on to what's next. You have time-sensitive decisions to make about your professional life while today's Pisces New Moon stirs up feelings in your 10th House of Career. Push through any resistance that's holding you back. Voicing your intentions clearly carries a great deal of conviction now that can help you determine a new direction."
cancer,2014-03-01,"Although your feelings may be evolving now, it's a good day to determine what you want in the weeks ahead. Imagining all the possibilities allows you to consciously choose your future. Don't let an amazing opportunity pass you by; now is your chance to shine with the Pisces New Moon activating your 9th House of Adventure. Although your dreams are the source of your current inspiration, your goals are more reachable if you maintain clarity of thought and integrity in all you do."
leo,2014-03-01,"It might be time to reassess a complex relationship that involves jointly held resources. The Pisces New Moon's presence in your 8th House of Deep Sharing means you may have to remove yourself from the situation in order to gain control of your life. But letting go of your attachments isn't easy, even with your newly discovered strength. Make the most of this moment, for the dynamics will only grow more complicated if you don't take decisive action today."
virgo,2014-03-01,"A different perspective drifts into awareness today, but it may require a special interaction with a friend or partner for you to get the complete picture. The Pisces New Moon in your 7th House of Companions inspires you to share your goals for the weeks ahead with someone you love and trust. But it's not sufficient to simply say what's on your mind now; it's necessary to follow up a conversation with long hours of hard work. Nevertheless, a productive discussion allows you to gain a sharper focus on the future, thus increasing your chances for success."
libra,2014-03-01,"Make a commitment today to improve your health by considering changes that directly impact your lifestyle. Setting the wheels of progress into motion is a great use of this Pisces New Moon as it energizes your 6th House of Daily Routine. Although the present moment is always the best time to make positive change, Mars is turning retrograde in your sign to complicate your plans and impede your progress. Don't give up on your goals; simply readjust your expectations based upon the shifting circumstances. Where there is a will, there is a way."
scorpio,2014-03-01,"There is a delicate balance between what you want to do today and what is actually manageable. You may need to temporarily sacrifice a long-term goal in order to focus on a current situation that has become very intense. Although the Pisces New Moon lands in your 5th House of Spontaneity, following your impulses won't necessarily lead you to satisfaction. Nevertheless, doing nothing is unacceptable now. Taking a carefully planned course of action is a sensible compromise and will likely bring the most beneficial results."
sagittarius,2014-03-01,"If you recently overstated your opinion in order to make your point, it's probably a good time to retreat for a while. The Pisces New Moon emphasizes your 4th House of Foundations, luring you back to emotional safety. But once you feel secure, you might venture out again soon, but this time with more realistic goals in mind. There is no need to exaggerate today since this only weakens your case. Speaking the truth from your heart assures that you're heard exactly as you intend."
capricorn,2014-03-01,"Living your life according to your plans can be quite a challenge today because other people's demands require that you change your schedule more than you want. Although the slippery Pisces New Moon sensitizes your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, there may not be any good reason to hold onto your old routine; familiarity is not a viable justification for doing something the same old way. Demonstrating your flexibility now helps you achieve more success in the days ahead."
aquarius,2014-03-01,"Even the simplest financial tasks -- like paying a few bills -- enables you to reestablish your footing on solid ground. Today's Pisces New Moon occurs in your 2nd House of Personal Resources, influencing your bottom line, but it's hard to tell in advance whether the effect will be good or bad. Put other distractions aside now and focus on practical matters for a while, even if logistics are not typically your top priority. You can pursue spiritual and metaphysical interests more freely once your mundane world is all in order."
pisces,2014-03-01,"Nearly anything you truly believe can have significant impact on your life, for today's Pisces New Moon is recharging your 1st House of Self, unleashing the waves of powerful change. Whatever you can do to expand your awareness now becomes more useful for navigating the many twists and turns in the days ahead. Activating your imagination is your best way to increase the potential of the present moment; where attention goes, energy flows."
aries,2014-03-02,"You receive a boost of power from Mars today, making you think you're fast enough to pass everyone else on the highway. However, it turns out that your car might not have enough horsepower to win the race. Your current plans could be built on an unrealistic assessment of the situation, so don't assume that everything will automatically go your way. Ease up on the accelerator; you'll arrive at your destination sooner if you don't push so hard. This is not a competition; just find a sustainable pace to reach your goal."
taurus,2014-03-02,"You're tempted to take action today so you won't have to defend yourself later -- especially if you feel that someone is attacking your values. It's easy to get worked up over this unsettling situation, but your integrity may not really be at stake. Achieving your relationship goals could require additional time, but the delays won't be significant if you stay flexible. Alter your path but not your destination, even if a partner's resistance is an obstacle. Adjusting your schedule is a small price to pay for progress."
gemini,2014-03-02,"You may feel as if you're working harder today, but not necessarily getting anything done. Although your high adrenaline has you twitching with excitement, your smartest strategy is to let circumstances dictate the speed at which you work. Instead of allowing anger to get the best of you, take the edge off your feelings by engaging in strenuous physical activity. But don't forget to pay careful attention to your feelings; your self-awareness can save you from emotionally exhausting yourself for no reason."
cancer,2014-03-02,"Although you're craving a meaningful connection with someone special, you still might be tempted to pull back into your shell to protect your heart. Unfortunately, buried emotional pain can turn into resentment, which is even more difficult to resolve later on. But now it's time to figure out what needs to be said and find ways to say it. Your future well-being depends on your willingness to bring your feelings out into the open once and for all."
leo,2014-03-02,"You're up for nearly anything today, especially if you can convince a group of people to join in your adventure. Unfortunately, it's not easy to get anyone to fall in line with your plans. However, your confidence flies in the face of logic now, inspiring everyone you encounter. Instead of attempting to restrain your friends and family members, encourage them to wander through their dreams in search of spiritual meaning. However, don't assume that others will reveal the ultimate truth to you. You must discover that for yourself."
virgo,2014-03-02,"Although your uncertainty makes it difficult to fulfill your commitments today, you still want to hold up your end of the deal. But your dreams can be overwhelming now and it's really not a good idea to shut them off so quickly.

Thankfully, there's no need to rush your agenda; it's more sensible to work at whatever pace feels comfortable to everyone involved. Lead by example and demonstrate your willingness to compromise."
scorpio,2014-03-02,"Your dreams may conjure up memories of the past and your emotions are so intense now that it's challenging to express them without instigating a bit of drama. Fortunately, you're capable of painting a beautiful picture from a less-than-pretty experience. Alternatively, you could misguide your creativity with negativity based on low self-esteem. No matter what, be careful about confusing your fears with what's truly happening in your environment. For the sake of peace, channel your passion into your art."
sagittarius,2014-03-02,"Your natural persuasive abilities are augmented now by your idealistic vision of what's possible. But this isn't about focusing on the details since you're more concerned with theory rather than practice. Nevertheless, make certain that what you are saying is true or you might mislead yourself as well as everyone else. Don't let tensions build to a breaking point. A logical plan, along with a willingness to listen to the opinions of others, is your best assurance to get what you want."
capricorn,2014-03-02,"You need to pick one idea and stick with it, as difficult as this sounds now. But don't take yourself too seriously since you can accomplish more if you have fun while you're doing your chores. Cut yourself a bit of slack; everything might take a bit longer to finish than you thought. You will be happier today once you accept that you're not always in control.

aquarius,2014-03-02,"You may feel exhausted from having to keep up appearances, but today you're drawn into situations that are lighthearted and joyful. Taking time for the kids or jumping into a creative project might be enough to stir up the energy. However this cosmic chemistry plays out, don't resist having fun while you can, even if it makes other parts of your life more complicated for a while. A bit of added complexity is a small price to pay for returning to your chores with a positive perspective and plenty of passion."
pisces,2014-03-02,"Pulling in your energy and being a little less aggressive about getting your way over the next couple of months might sound like odd advice for you sensitive Fish; however, it's just what you need to do. Paradoxically, you may accomplish more than usual during this time of retreat. Try to spend more time today listening to your own inner voice and tuning out the external noise. Even if this strategy makes you a bit stir crazy, remember that this is your chance to recharge your vitality and reconnect with your spiritual core."
aries,2014-03-03,"You may be feeling a bit battle weary as you tire of your own games today. Your current moodiness might even encourage you to lay low rather than joining the front lines in social or professional activities. Even if you have inescapable obligations, remember that you're being offered an opportunity to begin an important healing process. Set aside some time for quiet contemplation. Don't let this chance for renewal pass without making the most of it."
taurus,2014-03-03,"Hidden emotions cause you to feel more vulnerable, but you can't easily figure out a way through a complex situation. You want to share your feelings today, but you're not sure that what you say will further your cause. Ironically, the current isolation you're experiencing may be of your own creation now.

gemini,2014-03-03,"Turn the music off and stop dancing so you can actually listen to your thoughts now, even if you're slightly afraid of what you might hear. The truth is you have a better chance of reaching your goals if you find a way to express your fears.

Honoring your inner voice is an essential step in your healing process."
cancer,2014-03-03,"Everything appears copasetic on the surface, but you're picking up subtle signals today suggesting otherwise. Much of your energy is expressing outwardly now, leaving little left over for your personal pursuits. This theme of generosity has been around for a while, but you currently have a chance to shine the light of awareness into your subconscious and begin to fix what feels broken. Taking a journey within is the most efficient way to change what's on the outside."
leo,2014-03-03,"It might be annoying but you won't be able to fully enjoy yourself today until you finish all your chores. It's not that an authority figure is threatening you with punishment if you don't take care of your responsibilities. It's more about being sensible and doing the right thing. If you don't do the work now, no one else will show up either. So, make a list and start plowing through it; the sooner, the better."
virgo,2014-03-03,"Even if you don't accomplish everything that's on today's agenda, you can still feel good about what you manage to get done. There is a strange logic to your behavior now, giving you plenty of room to be spontaneous and creative, even if others think that you're acting out of character.

Always being the optimist can take its toll on you, but don't worry about what others expect now.

However, you still have work to do these days, so acknowledge your weaknesses, focus on your strengths and embrace your future."
capricorn,2014-03-03,"You may be particularly pensive today because something you want seems just beyond your grasp. You can't understand why it's not just yours for the taking. However, you might be wearing an emotional scar like a badge of honor, even if it's not in your best interest to glorify old wounds.

aquarius,2014-03-03,"You're quite restless today for no logical reason. You can't sit still for longer than a few minutes at a time, but it's not clear what this nervous energy is about.

There's great potential for an emotional breakthrough now if you have the courage to see things as they actually are. The truth will set you free, if you let it."
pisces,2014-03-03,"Leaning on your friends for emotional support today could bring you the confidence you need in your battle with your own ghosts and goblins.

The problem with your current desire to share is that you might not be able to hide your secrets once you get started. However, it's not worth the struggle to keep silent because expressing your emotions is the most straightforward way to communicate your personal truth. Find someone you trust to confide in and a burden will be lifted from your shoulders."
gemini,2014-03-04,"You can see exactly what's happening now, but communicating your perceptions out loud is a different story. Just because you are well informed doesn't mean you should necessarily tell others everything you know. In fact, your maturity is currently being tested by the universe. Don't fall prey to your own guilt; an unnecessary confession won't solve anything. Reconcile with your past before talking with anyone else about the present."

Even if you still have to return to an unresolved issue later, at least everything seems somewhat easier to handle now with a supportive shoulder to lean on."
leo,2014-03-04,"Your optimism may run into an obstacle today, but a bit of unexpected resistance might be just what you need to motivate you even more. Most likely, you already have too much work to do, making it tough to get your priorities right if you just shoot from the hip when a problem surfaces. Instead of waiting for trouble, create a to-do list and map out the rest of the week in advance. Even if you must deviate from your plan later on, your enthusiasm still helps you to get moving in the right direction now."
virgo,2014-03-04,"You're on a creative roll this week, and hopefully you will apply some of your current ingenuity toward your long-term goals. But there's no time for pie-in-the-sky dreaming today.

Peer into the unknown with confidence; whatever you learn today helps you figure out what moves to make next."
scorpio,2014-03-04,"The simplicity of someone's reaction to your behavior today may remind you of what is important. Sometimes you might get lost in the emotional complexity of your contemplation of the meaning of life. You Scorpios are the navigational champions of the hidden realms.

The best opportunities will arrive later if you take the time to lay a solid foundation now."
capricorn,2014-03-04,"Making progress on all fronts is very likely today if you don't try to bite off more than you can chew. Although the planets are not encouraging you to over-indulge or over-extend, everything might be running smoothly enough now to make a complicated plan look easier than it is. Integrity and determination are your greatest assets; use them wisely and you'll be pleased with the results."
aquarius,2014-03-04,"Even if you're preoccupied with your work today, you still might be feeling stress from other areas of your life. Practical responsibilities leave you no time to yourself now, preventing you from realizing your dreams. But your frustration has nowhere to go unless you find a healthy outlet for your anger. It's crucial to keep your emotions from getting stuck, so share your inner process with a confidant to help alleviate the pressure. Take a few deep breaths and count your blessings."
pisces,2014-03-04,"You Fish like the idea of swimming around aimlessly, following the predominant tides. You excel at going with the flow when times get rough. However, something is different today because you have a specific direction in mind. Knowing where you want to go, however, won't necessarily get you there. First you need a map you can trust and a solid plan in place. Additionally, creating firm boundaries prevents you from being distracted, enabling you to reach your destination just in time."
aries,2014-03-05,"A thick layer of resistance starts to clear as you are released from a previous commitment. Thankfully, you can visualize some free time on your calendar, so start making plans now to be with your friends. But be careful not to put too many events on your schedule or you might just feel restrained again. Too much social activity is just as oppressive as too much work. Allow a little room just for yourself with nothing to do at all."

Simultaneously, this transit could also stress your romantic life.

Remember, your public life has little meaning if you don't also attend to your heart."
gemini,2014-03-05,"You are blown about by some unexpected winds of change today as whimsical Mercury connects with radical Uranus. Your attractions are growing more diverse and you are losing patience because you're not content to wait and see where you land in the next few years. This is not just idle curiosity at work; you have a genuine desire to expand your horizons now. Don't resist the shifting currents; instead, imagine your destination in your mind's eye, and then let it go."
cancer,2014-03-05,"You might feel unsettled today, as if your emotions are out of sorts. However, your concern is not likely strong enough to make you do anything drastic. Be careful that you don't become too possessive in a relationship since the presence of Venus in your 8th of Intimacy entices you with the notion of assuming more control. Unfortunately, tightening your grip could backfire quickly if you let your fears get the best of you. Open your heart and let love in."
leo,2014-03-05,"You want more out of life now but aren't prepared to sacrifice your freedom to get it. Venus is tripping through your 7th House of Partners, turning your attention toward a variety of relationships this month. It may be easy these days to earn adoration, but being in the spotlight can make your life more complex as you strive for greater independence. Remember, compromise is tricky; there's no reason to give up too much to get something you don't even want."
virgo,2014-03-05,"You have decisions to make today, yet you may be feeling ambivalent as you're pulled simultaneously in two different directions. Instead of looking for one long-term solution, focus on the satisfaction you can derive from helping others now. Being of service reminds you of what matters and motivates you to do your current job as compassionately as possible."
libra,2014-03-05,"You're in the mood to play today, even if you must finish your work first. Your desire for self-indulgence is high throughout the month as your key planet Venus luxuriates in your 5th House of Spontaneity and Pleasure. Lighthearted fun takes precedence now, but it's still wise to concentrate on your boundaries so you don't eat, drink or party more than you should. Maintaining a healthy balance means more time to enjoy yourself in the long run."
scorpio,2014-03-05,"Idealizing the past could make you feel nostalgic today, giving rise to tension about a current situation. You are more attracted now to creature comforts at home, but might be overly hard on yourself as you fulfill your needs instead of resolving a problem. However, you are not just taking the easy way out by being kinder to yourself. You are also building a foundation for the big changes that are already on their way."
sagittarius,2014-03-05,"Your love light could undergo changes as you trade common sense for greater independence over the next month. You have a more mental attachment to pleasure now that resourceful Venus is visiting your 3rd House of Communication. Although someone might think you're pulling away, you are just less concerned with expressing your passion. Don't let anyone else's reactions put you off. Revealing your unconventional needs to a trustworthy friend doesn't mean your freedom is at risk."
capricorn,2014-03-05,"Contrary to what your heart is saying, it makes more sense to build on what you have already started over the past few months. Sweet Venus enters your 2nd House of Possessions today, where she triggers all your delicious cravings. Although you Goats know that stability is more important than fleeting gratification, sometimes you deserve to indulge. However, be careful about putting yourself in a financially precarious position as you strive for emotional satisfaction through the material world."
aquarius,2014-03-05,"It may take a few days for an energetic wave of good feelings to wash over your life after lovely Venus dances into your sign. However, someone else might notice a change in you right away. You have a twinkle in your eye now, making you even more alluring. Take advantage of this time by upgrading your image any way you can. Wanting to present yourself in a positive light is not shallow; it's simply a reflection of your healthy self-esteem. Real beauty shines from within."
pisces,2014-03-05,"Feeling compassionate places an uncharacteristic strain on you now because you want to establish clear boundaries between you and others. Paradoxically, it may be this sense of separateness that enables you to be so empathetic, since you don't need to be concerned now about being swallowed up by your own sensitivity. As long as you accept the fact that you cannot save the whole world, you can certainly help some deserving people along the way -- including yourself."
aries,2014-03-06,"You are psyched to accomplish a lot today, but circumstances could change so much that you must modify your schedule to make it work. Taking success for granted isn't wise since you may have to put in extra effort now to see any real progress. Don't be sidetracked by any shortcuts either, for they will only slow you down in the long run. Instead of putting on an air of bravado, get serious and keep bringing your focus back to the tasks at hand. Self-discipline is an essential key to success."
taurus,2014-03-06,"Your feelings may be tied up in knots as you face an annoying setback today. Even a simple desire grows more complicated if you obsess about someone trying to control you.

Your best shot at satisfaction comes from concentrating on the present moment and relentlessly working to reach your goals."

Although your key planet Mercury is finally regaining speed as it continues to recover from its retrograde phase, you still have a long way to go to make up for recent delays. Don't make major changes to your existing plans until you allow enough time to see how far they can take you. Have patience; everything is going to be alright."
cancer,2014-03-06,"You are eager to begin the process of letting go as the reflective Moon moves into your 12th House of Endings. But your work may not flow as easily as you wish now, and there's no simple way to force yourself through the current creative block. Instead of getting hung up about something on the job that isn't gaining traction, pay attention to the signs and observe the clues around you. Once you decipher the message, you can proceed to the next step of preparing for your future."
leo,2014-03-06,"Your role at work grows complicated today as relationship dynamics turn more social. However, you have personal business that must be attended to now, even if it's not much fun. Once you push through your own resistance, everything seems to become easier, freeing up enough time for you to do something totally unexpected by your peers. Setting your mind on a particular accomplishment is a wise strategy, but things won't necessarily turn out as planned. Let the element of surprise work in your favor."
virgo,2014-03-06,"It's all about establishing healthy patterns today and sticking to them, whether you have something better to do or not. Your place of employment may be a bit overrun with people experiencing powerful emotions -- yet you're not interested in becoming one of them. Be fierce as you monitor your own performance in light of your career objectives. Make a few positive modifications to your daily routine before you try to move further up the ladder of success."
libra,2014-03-06,"Your relationships may be a source of disappointment these days, especially if you're not getting all your needs met. Your romantic urges are strong now as flirty Venus hangs out in your 5th House of Creativity and Romance. You would rather be spending quality time with someone you love than being on your own today. No matter what you do, remember to relax; you really have more time to fulfill your personal goals than you think."
scorpio,2014-03-06,"Your emotional detachment is rather disarming now because this lack of intensity isn't in character for you. You want to take a rational approach to sort out unresolved issues today. You're able to smooth ruffled feathers, but your friends might still be uncomfortable because they can't read your energy through the layers of insulation. Maintaining boundaries may be the best way to protect your vulnerable core. Secrets are useful at times, but don't withdraw any more than is necessary."
sagittarius,2014-03-06,"Be quiet and listen to other people's words today, because there is a lot at stake. The most useful information comes to you from your coworkers while the Moon is still visiting your 6th House of Employment. You won't want to skip a single opportunity for a meaningful conversation because this is a time of such significant changes. Even if you share your own perspective, pay close attention when relevant feedback is offered in return. Being patient enables missing puzzle pieces to fall into place."
capricorn,2014-03-06,"It's often impossible for others to argue with your authority, but this may not be true today. It's especially challenging if you're feeling socially awkward, leaving you to doubt your ability to handle the current circumstances. Rest assured that your personal integrity is ultimately one of your greatest strengths, so don't even think about sacrificing it for the sake of expediency. Remain open to the advice you receive but following your moral compass is still your best bet."
aquarius,2014-03-06,"You might have opportunities to share your feelings in a variety of situations today, but the dynamics could grow more complicated once you actually start talking. However, it's not a very smart idea to stop midstream, even if you don't understand the potential influence of your words in the moment. Fortunately, everything should make a lot more sense within a few days. In the meantime, don't waste energy imagining all the scenarios; the future will unfold soon enough."
pisces,2014-03-06,"Although others may not notice, you have a lot of emotional turmoil just beneath the surface today. Even if those close to you ask revealing questions, you can smoothly evade them with a smile. However, you would be wise to pay close attention because someone might have less than honorable intentions. Keeping a healthy distance is a good idea if you're feeling uncomfortable now. Don't overanalyze; trust your intuition."
aries,2014-03-07,"Setting priorities and focusing on the most important tasks first maximizes your productivity today. However, you may be fighting an uphill battle because the Gemini Moon tempts you to scatter your energy. Nearly every thought you have now inspires you, making it tough to complete anything before running off with another great idea. Thankfully, you can take control of your restlessness by consciously committing to finish whatever you start."
taurus,2014-03-07,"You're excited about sharing a recent spiritual experience or an interesting dream with someone special. However, once you get started, you might say more than you initially intended. Ironically, you could use a lot of words now and still not tell your whole story. Omitting significant pieces of information is one way to avoid the truth. There's nothing wrong with this evasive strategy if you promised to keep a secret for someone; however intentional forgetfulness just to save your own skin will lead to trouble."
gemini,2014-03-07,"You're more responsive to others now that the Moon is back in your sign, but your coworkers may not fully understand your message. Your words are clear enough; however, your moods change so quickly that you might be on to feeling something new before you're finished describing your previous emotion. Fortunately, no one needs to know about every single whim that crosses your mind. Your internal process can unfold on its own as long as you are attentive to those around you."
cancer,2014-03-07,"The words are running through your head so fast today that it's challenging to find a place to jump in and start talking. Your fantasy life is very rich now, yet nearly everything feels too complicated to explain. It's tough enough sharing even a simple idea. You might know what's going on, but still may choose to remain silent. Trust your instincts and wait for just the right moment to tell everyone your thoughts."
leo,2014-03-07,"You seem transparent to your friends now, but there's more happening in your world than meets the eye. You're not going out of your way to hide anything; it's just that your words can't quite describe the nuance of your feelings. It's easier to throw yourself into work than share what's on your mind. Everyone seems to appreciate that you're putting in extra effort today, yet it's the tangible projects that endure over the long run that truly count."
virgo,2014-03-07,"You don't want to reveal your true feelings today because you're worried that others will sense your scattered energy. While the restless Gemini Moon could have you bouncing off the walls, you somehow manage to hide your high anxiety anyhow. You're not likely to accomplish as much as you want now, but you're not quite as unfocused as you think. Keep bringing your attention back to your current obligations, rather than losing yourself in a sea of distractions."
libra,2014-03-07,"Don't avoid confronting the source of your current tension just because it's easy to escape from your mental struggles today. The Moon is visiting your 9th House of Travel now, indicating that distant horizons are the most attractive subjects of your fantasies. Your visions may be rather captivating, but real satisfaction requires you to work things out closer to home. You can be the king of the world in your dreams, yet it's in your best interest to create a more honest relationship with reality."
scorpio,2014-03-07,"Sometimes, complicated issues are best met with simple solutions. Set aside the allure of unconventional emotional entanglements and avoid the intriguing possibilities of interactions that may never happen. Carefully steer clear of all drama now that doesn't directly concern you. Although you're tempted to spin tall tales today, you're wise to keep things as uncomplicated as possible. Discretion is the better part of valor."
sagittarius,2014-03-07,"You're alternately pulled between being quite serious and very silly today since the emotional climate changes on a moment's notice. Both extremes make perfect sense, but only for a while and only one at a time. Keep in mind that your moods are more dependent than ever on those around you. Stay flexible now while openly responding to the current dynamics by sharing what's in your heart."
capricorn,2014-03-07,"Your need to sort through all the information at work today could test everyone's patience. This incoming mountain of data may create a rather delicate situation, especially if someone is waiting on your assessment. It's not that you are any less reliable now; it's just that you could take on more than you can finish. The smartest way to avoid unnecessary conflict is to set boundaries early in the day so you don't make unrealistic assumptions and tempt others to have unreasonable expectations."
aquarius,2014-03-07,"Managing your disappointment might require extra effort today, especially if you're dealing with a variety of obstacles. Fortunately, your hope is buoyant and you know that things will only improve if you keep the faith. Your positive attitude could be enough to transform a difficult situation into an opportunity that ultimately works in your favor. Even if you can't control the outcome, you're still responsible for how you respond."
pisces,2014-03-07,"Your tender heart inspires you to assist those less fortunate, but you may be required to contain your feelings today. Ironically, your current compassion might quickly lead you astray and provide a coworker with easy ammunition to put you in your place. There's nothing wrong with wanting to help others as long as you meet your obligations first. Although it's wise to acknowledge when your timing is off or your actions misguided, don't waste energy apologizing again and again. It's better to just work harder now than it is to harbor unproductive feelings of guilt later on."
aries,2014-03-08,"Slowing down to take it easy sounds like a good idea today, but reality might still have a surprise or two in store for you. Unfortunately, this isn't the best day to get some rest so you may as well embrace the interruptions instead of attempting to avoid the unexpected. Even if you don't produce anything tangible now, an unplanned detour can ultimately turn a boring day into one you will remember for a long time to come."
taurus,2014-03-08,"Someone might expect you to give a lot of yourself without receiving much in return today. Although you may derive personal satisfaction from your service to others, putting out the effort can take its toll on you. It could feel like you're losing ground, as if the currents are actually carrying you backward now, but this is just a temporary illusion. Thankfully, you know something about being patient. Don't even consider giving up; your persistence will bring rewards soon enough."
gemini,2014-03-08,"You may feel frazzled with the emotional Moon in your sign today; you know something that others don't but you can't say anything about it yet. Perhaps you made a promise to keep quiet. Or maybe the current timing isn't quite right. Stick to your previous decision about what should and shouldn't be shared. Don't be overly concerned now because so many things are in the process of change, anyhow. It may take a while before your boundaries are clear and you have a viable plan in place."
cancer,2014-03-08,"You have more data at your fingertips now than anyone realizes, but you don't have to tell everyone everything you know. Luckily, your current breadth of knowledge is probably sufficient to answer most questions today, but you still may be tempted to push your luck and try to uncover even more. Instead of struggling on your own, be brave and ask for help if you need it. And, when someone offers assistance, accept it graciously with a smile."
leo,2014-03-08,"There's really no need to worry about what you must do today, for you are at your best when you're just being spontaneous. Although you can quickly become distracted by your cohorts, forget about trying to entertain everyone else for now. For once, just follow the course of least resistance, and let the magic of the day take you wherever it goes. Embrace the unknown; serendipity is your friend."
virgo,2014-03-08,"Many of your acquaintances are looking to you for guidance during these uncertain times, even if you aren't interested in accepting a leadership role now. It isn't that you lack the skills to be an excellent manager; it's just that you might be tired of always having to tell everyone what to do. For a change of pace, cut yourself some slack and do something special just for you. Encouraging self-sufficiency has its benefits for all involved. You can always check back in to see how others are doing later on."
libra,2014-03-08,"It might seem strange that this weekend isn't even over and you're already dreaming about the next one. On the surface, this type of foresight sounds like a smart idea, but it's rather challenging to totally enjoy what's happening right under your nose when you're thinking about the future. Relax and take time to smell the flowers today. Living in the moment is your fastest route to fun."
scorpio,2014-03-08,"An enjoyable interaction may morph into something special as the flirty Gemini Moon aspects the radiant Sun and chatty Mercury today. But you must be willing to shine and play your part in order to see where the relationship goes. If you don't try to connect with others in a deeper way when you're given the opportunity, then you'll never know where it could lead. A friendly smile might be all you need to get the ball rolling."
sagittarius,2014-03-08,"Concentrating on just one activity at a time today is nearly impossible because you encounter one distraction after another. You might try to convince others that you are being practical now, but your willingness to accept the next invitation -- whatever it is -- proves otherwise. Instead of just jumping at whatever comes along, take time to explore your options with those involved. It's better to know what you're getting into prior to being stuck somewhere you don't want to be. Speak now or forever hold your peace."
capricorn,2014-03-08,"It might be quite reassuring today to honor a family tradition or a personally meaningful ritual from the past. You may decide to take a quick trip to see your kids or visit your parents. No matter what you choose to do, try a new and improved approach to the old and familiar. Instead of falling in a rut, break up the drudgery with something that's a lot more fun. Wandering down Memory Lane can be quite a joyful experience."
aquarius,2014-03-08,"You could be worried that the weekend will come and go before you can finish what's already on your plate. Unfortunately, slipping into denial won't enable you to sidestep what's heading your way. However, it's more useful to concentrate on the present moment instead of focusing your attention on the future. Scaling back your expectations now gives you extra time to relax and count your blessings."
pisces,2014-03-08,"Although you're sure about what you want now, you might get confused if you don't know exactly how to get it. Today's Gemini Moon stimulates your curiosity and makes the day more interesting, but it also complicates your life. You grow even more conflicted because your head is saying one thing while your heart is tugging in an entirely different direction. Ultimately, you are happiest when you let your conscience be your guide and do what feels right."
aries,2014-03-09,"You are highly driven to participate in group activities now, yet it's also essential to allow time for quiet contemplation. However, your patience may run thin today and you might remember why you often prefer to work or play alone. It's difficult to express your frustration to others who don't keep up with your pace. Thankfully, your current inclination for solitude goes beyond convenience, so recharge your batteries while you have the chance."
taurus,2014-03-09,"You may not be sure about sharing your feelings today because you don't want to risk the stability you recently created. But withholding crucial information can leave you vulnerable if you have to focus a portion of your mindshare on monitoring everything you say. Make a conscious effort to discuss your fears or your unexpressed emotions will give you away, anyhow. Ultimately, an honest approach is the safest one for everyone involved."
gemini,2014-03-09,"The hectic pace of the past few days should slow down today, giving you time to integrate recent events. Reconsidering your assumptions enables you to switch positions, if necessary. It's like you are playing defense on a baseball field; when something comes your way, you must be ready to catch it. The faster your reflexes are now the faster you can react, giving you extra time to calculate your next move and execute your plan successfully."
cancer,2014-03-09,"You are feeling rather wobbly about your feelings today because your moods seem to be shifting radically from one moment to the next. You want to pour out your heart to a friend or lover now, and yet minutes later you want to crawl into the safety of your secret cave. Ground yourself the best you can and then let the waves gently wash over you. Don't make any long-lasting decisions until your emotions settle down and your clarity returns."
leo,2014-03-09,"It might seem as if no one really sees who you are, even if you are in plain sight. You don't understand how people can sidestep your point of view as you proudly hold your head high and carry out your assigned task, even while your heart is hurting. A humble disclosure might bring the recognition you seek, even if it makes you feel a bit uncomfortable at first. Oddly enough, others will appreciate your weaknesses as well as your strengths. Shine your light in the dark if you want to get noticed."
virgo,2014-03-09,"You're eager to accept the support of your friends and colleagues today, but moments later you might be pushing them away. Your behavior may seem full of contradictions, but you appreciate the camaraderie, nevertheless. Of course, you can take care of yourself, but nothing is gained by alienating those around you. Soften your stance and let others help you, even if you think you're already doing fine. Celebrating success is more satisfying in the company of those you love."
libra,2014-03-09,"Tricky emotional currents today might require you to relinquish some of the control you wish you could keep. It may come as a shock that you're not responsible for anyone else's feelings but your own. Don't attempt to fix a situation by making someone more comfortable. Instead, shift the energy and focus on improving yourself. Once you change your automatic response to something more positive, others will begin to do the same."
scorpio,2014-03-09,"You are content exploring your emotions in the privacy of your own space today. Your personal security is extremely important to you now and you are happiest wherever you feel safe and sound. Once you are comfortably situated, you can open the floodgates and go anywhere you desire by traveling on the wings of your imagination. Meditating in a sacred place gives you the chance to discover spiritual dimensions you never knew existed before."
sagittarius,2014-03-09,"Cosmic forces might be bending you out of shape today, encouraging your naturally adventurous personality to adopt a more cautious stance. There's no need to succumb to the pressures of social expectations. You can't please anyone else if you haven't acknowledged your own needs first. Give yourself permission to withdraw until you feel ready to work with others. Make the best of the situation and take this time to reconnect with your heart."
capricorn,2014-03-09,"You don't have the time or the patience to babysit a friend or colleague while he or she goes through an emotional meltdown today. Nevertheless, you can still respond in a compassionate manner. Just make sure to establish clear boundaries before you find yourself in over your head. Being aware of your own feelings is healthy, even if their expression doesn't always fit neatly into your schedule."
aquarius,2014-03-09,"You might feel as if a relationship crisis is looming, but don't use your personal life as an excuse if you're falling behind at work. Although you may see both sides of a conflict now, it's not worth the effort trying to justify your position. Nevertheless, running away is not the answer either. Instead, retreat only enough to create some space between you and everyone else to reduce your need to escape any further. Focus on what you can control and forget about the rest."
pisces,2014-03-09,"You're slowly drifting away from the crowd today as you hone in on a creative realization that continues to occupy more of your time. Luckily, you should be able to direct this energy toward playful expression, whether for work or your own personal amusement. In either case, having a little fun will ultimately make you more productive in the long run. Let loose and follow your heart."
aries,2014-03-10,"It may be time to offset serious work with a bit of socializing today, especially if you have been overly ambitious these past few weeks. However, the theme of the day isn't about escapist fun; it's about creating a dynamic network that empowers you to expand your horizons. Hanging out with colleagues or friends is a great idea if it stimulates your dreams of the future. Spread your wings; just make sure you're in supportive company before you take off."
taurus,2014-03-10,"You have high hopes for the week ahead, but you might be hesitant to share your plans until they are more developed. In the meantime, do whatever is required now to fulfill the promises you recently made. But doing your job well isn't your only goal today; you also want to be acknowledged for your contributions. Placing your personal ambitions on hold for a while may be necessary so you can shine while meeting your current responsibilities."
gemini,2014-03-10,"Although you might be motivated to improve your finances today, there's no simple way to achieve the results you want. Nevertheless, what you do now can have a positive impact on your future earnings. Don't let self-doubt prevent you from working on your plan for prosperity. Instead of aiming for immediate satisfaction, a slower and more methodical approach increases your chances for success."
cancer,2014-03-10,"You have a keen intuitive sense of how to handle your feelings today, even if circumstances are a bit complicated. It's quite possible that your emotional needs are not being fully met now by your current relationships, but you might not have better options at this time. Being appreciative of your blessings doesn't mean you need to accept the status quo. Expressing your desires clearly without worrying about the outcome may be enough to set the wheels of satisfaction into motion."
leo,2014-03-10,"Relationships are a source of delight and frustration these days and your clarity in communication helps to keep things on the positive side of the equation. Although you could make much progress diffusing conflicts today, the underlying problems won't likely be resolved very soon. Even if others don't meet your high standards now, you can still find joy if you accept the love that comes your way. Obviously, you don't need to settle for less than you deserve, but sometimes it helps to remember that everyone's doing the best that they can."
virgo,2014-03-10,"Although you typically come through with whatever is required, attending to the details today might be quite irritating. It may be wise to temporarily set aside your perfectionist tendencies in favor of a more fluid style now. You could receive more help from your friends than you expect, so give yourself permission to delegate some of the tasks on your list. Allowing others to pick up the loose ends works out well for all involved."
libra,2014-03-10,"You're so eager to express a more artistic side of yourself today that you're willing to do it any way possible. Unfortunately, you might try so hard to be Picasso that you end up with a blank canvas. Instead of attempting to push the river of creativity, it's wiser to just let it flow on its own natural course. Don't worry if the process takes more time than you expect; fill in the hours with unrelated activities that also need to be finished. A relaxed approach is more productive in the long run."
scorpio,2014-03-10,"You often prefer flying under the radar. Instead of seeking recognition for your work, you have more freedom if you remain unseen now. But don't waste the independence you have earned; use this time wisely to plan the next phase of your life. There's no need to make any noticeable waves yet. Entertain all possibilities and then narrow down your choices over the next few weeks. The less others know about your upcoming adventures, the better."
sagittarius,2014-03-10,"There's so much going on in your life right now that it's time to pull the plug on some unnecessary distractions. You might wish you could escape from the noise for a few days, but you must continue to meet your responsibilities. However, you also need to stay connected with the emotional support you receive from your friends and family. Ultimately, balancing the personal and the professional sides of your life boosts your confidence and motivates you to reach for the stars."
capricorn,2014-03-10,"Being nurtured by a loved one is good for the soul, although sometimes you're not comfortable with too much dependency. On the other hand, it's tough to come through for someone you love while also taking care of your own needs now. Even if you're currently working on personal issues, it's probably more productive to focus on helping others today. The gratitude you receive could lift your spirits when you need it the most."
aquarius,2014-03-10,"You derive great benefit from the power of positive thinking because you are more sensitive now that the responsive Cancer Moon is activating your emotional receptors. You don't have the luxury of doubting your recent decisions or your current capabilities. Instead, put your efforts toward fine-tuning your plans; get your ducks in order so you're ready to fly when the time is right."
pisces,2014-03-10,"You're not in the mood to explain your behavior now; words would only detract from your profound process. You're quite happy today swimming around in deep waters because you feel safer being far out of sight. Luckily, there are metaphysical treasures waiting to be discovered beneath the surface if you're willing to leave language behind. Losing yourself in the feelings and the images can be a magical experience, especially if you take time to remember your dreams and write them down upon your return."
aries,2014-03-11,"You're ready to let go of an old resentment today because you realize that holding a grudge serves no purpose. You're quite capable of making your coworkers feel at ease, but not if you're pointing your finger in blame at someone else. Your intentions may be altruistic, yet you still might meet a bit of resistance. Give it time; others can't help but soften under the influence of your friendly approach and sincere effort."
taurus,2014-03-11,"You know you have choices to make today, but your goals might not be clear enough to choose a direction. At first your path seems straightforward, but it grows convoluted as you get sidetracked by someone else's feelings. A battle of wills is destructive if you each have your own agenda, but clearing the air can reduce the tension. It's easy to declare your willingness to be flexible now, but you must actually be open to change if you're to jointly decide where you want to go next."
gemini,2014-03-11,"There are still plenty of details to hammer out, but the possibility of resolution continues to grow. Even if you don't have a lot of available options today, you might need to make a decision, nonetheless. Your optimism may be temporarily replaced with annoyance if your responsibilities distract you from having fun. Although life could seem harsh in the moment, don't over-personalize the current situation. Pay attention to what others are telling you and if the feedback makes sense, then take it to heart."
cancer,2014-03-11,"You may have big ideas about what you want to accomplish today, only to realize that you don't have as much energy as you need. Trying to fulfill all your current obligations is stressful because you must work so hard just to keep up with everything. Additionally, your emotions could wear you out now as you grapple with the subtle nuances of your subconscious desires. Setting a sustainable pace right from the start can prevent an unnecessary meltdown. Be kind to everyone, starting with yourself."
leo,2014-03-11,"You might have to postpone a social activity today because of an important deadline. Perhaps you need to cut back on your expectations now, especially if you discover that your goals are unrealistic. However, there's no need to stress about a missed opportunity if you can't make something happen right away. Instead, accept the limitations of your circumstances, do whatever you can, and move on with a clear conscience."
virgo,2014-03-11,"Rethinking your position on an important matter may be necessary today if you encounter resistance to what you say. However, the discord likely comes from within; you could be your own toughest critic now that your key planet Mercury squares off with taskmaster Saturn. Although your ideas are worthwhile, they still might not seem good enough to you. Unfortunately, if you channel enough energy into your fears, something will undoubtedly go wrong. Instead, improve your attitude and concentrate on creating a positive outcome."
libra,2014-03-11,"You might feel bounced around by what others are saying now. It appears as if they aren't thinking about the consequences of their words, yet you could end up feeling their negative effects. This drama may be playing out within the workplace today and it seems as if you're being drawn into a no-win situation. However, there is still good news, since your natural willingness to find where differences of opinions turn into common ground can ultimately set the stage for negotiating lasting solutions."
scorpio,2014-03-11,"Building on your previous achievements makes much more sense now than starting all over to do something completely new. Luckily, your dreams can be a rich source of inspiration upon which you can build a sensible plan. Don't let anyone talk you out of something that you already know, but they haven't yet learned. Trust your instincts over anyone else's advice to steer you in the right direction today."
sagittarius,2014-03-11,"Your emotions are intense today, especially if you choose to keep them to yourself. Although you're still fairly optimistic about your future, insecurities creep back into your thoughts as quicksilver Mercury stressfully squares naysayer Saturn. Keep in mind, you can be realistic in your assessment without having a defeatist attitude. All you need to do is believe in yourself and trust the process. Patience is a virtue, especially now."
capricorn,2014-03-11,"You may be hiding your wounded feelings today, especially if someone rejects your plan without even hearing you out. You might feel as if obstacles are being placed in your path for no apparent reason until it dawns on you that you have been moving your agenda ahead too fast. In order to accomplish your goals, wait and let circumstances catch up to your dreams of the future. If your new ideas are worthwhile, they'll be even better in a few days."
aquarius,2014-03-11,"The pressure to take care of unfulfilled responsibilities has grown stronger in recent days. Unfortunately, you also have to attend to your daily chores, no matter how many exciting ideas you want to pursue today. Reevaluate your workload; perhaps it's time to temporarily cut back on your activities if you are spread too thin. Although you may be judged by your current performance, it's more crucial to be true to yourself now than to live up to the expectations of others."
pisces,2014-03-11,"Although relationships may bring you emotional satisfaction, some of the greatest rewards take longer to manifest. So, whatever you do, don't get discouraged now when it comes to love and creativity, even if progress seems slower than ever. Don't waste energy today complaining about what can't be changed. Instead, work hard to meet your responsibilities so you have sufficient time later on to spend on romantic or artistic pursuits."
aries,2014-03-12,"You're all set to blast ahead today and you might not give it a second thought if you shoot out of the gate quickly enough. However, taking pause for even just one moment may be all that's needed to send you into a tailspin of self-doubt. Ironically, this bout of uncertainty could be the best thing that happens. Fortunately, your detour won't last long, and it can open your eyes to alternative courses of action that ultimately prove to be smarter than your first choice. Don't rush your decision; you have more time than you think."
taurus,2014-03-12,"Demonstrating your affection for your friends is a lovely gesture today, but grandiose acts of generosity might reveal more about your insecurities than you wish. Try not to go overboard in your attempt to get your feelings across. However, you can't worry about how others respond to you now; your analysis could backfire if you attempt to outthink them. Instead, keep it simple and just lead with your heart."
gemini,2014-03-12,Your quick wit is more likely to get you into trouble today than charm anyone or solve an existing problem. You are able to think faster now that your mind can slip in and out of alternate realities without others even noticing. But sloppy logic hijacks your day if you don't take the time to separate your fantasies from the real world. There's nothing wrong with dreaming a little dream as long as you know when to wake up and deal with the truth.
cancer,2014-03-12,"You may be surfing on a wave of adrenaline that carries you outside of your comfort zone today. When you finally realize how far you've traveled, a secondary current of excitement can transport you even farther from your usual place of safety. Fortunately, once you push through your initial fear, you might be surprised at how easy it is to say what's on your mind and take things to the next level. Don't hurry the process; you are laying the groundwork for what's to come over the next couple of months."
leo,2014-03-12,"There's no reason to stifle your roar now because everyone already knows how you are feeling. Although you won't reveal any shocking news today, the intensity of your pent-up anger still might catch others off guard. But their discomfort with your message is not your problem. However, with the Moon back in your expressive sign, it's simply your job to reflect the truth as you perceive it. Just remember that there are many ways to frame the same situation, so don't assume that you have a corner on all the answers."
virgo,2014-03-12,"You have plenty to say today, but you might end up deciding that it's better to wait a few days before sharing your thoughts. Taking time to consider a variety of options makes sense, but it's also wise to observe what happens next before you commit to a specific path. You may be feeling confident right now, but navigating the shifting currents requires a soft touch and the willingness to readjust your course as needed."
libra,2014-03-12,"Your friends and colleagues may be planning something in the next few days that sounds like a lot of fun to you. You would love to join them, but previous commitments could complicate your schedule. Nevertheless, what seems like an irresolvable conflict at first might be the catalyst for an overdue discussion and a much-needed change. Don't say no before you try to figure out how to balance work with play."
scorpio,2014-03-12,"It really doesn't matter what you're feeling today; the show must go on regardless. Maybe you have been withholding your thoughts and are finally ready to express them now; however, this may not be the best moment to let down your guard. You have a specific role to play at work and in some ways it is the same as giving a performance. Act like a true professional and demonstrate your competence. Wait to share what's on your mind for a more appropriate time when you have an appreciative audience."
sagittarius,2014-03-12,"Your feelings are irrepressible today and you're ready to shout your truth from the rooftops. Even if you are very sensitive to others now, you still won't be able to withhold your opinions. Although you really don't mean to upset anyone, your direct communication style can seem abrasive. You don't have to alter the content of your message; you just need a bit of finesse in your delivery style."
capricorn,2014-03-12,"You are intrigued by the power of your actions now and may go out of your way to agitate complex emotions that escalate a situation into a conflict. However, your strategy won't likely bring you any closer to your goals, and it could even damage a close relationship. Don't toy with someone's feelings just to satisfy your own curiosity. Instead, discussing your plans for the future can set the stage for real progress while also increasing the level of intimacy."
aquarius,2014-03-12,"Someone new may enter your life now that the affectionate Leo Moon is visiting your 7th House of Partnerships. Or, perhaps, an old business or personal relationship might be rekindled. In either situation, it seems as if hidden forces are at work, turning a normal event into something very special. Don't try to make logical sense out of everything that happens today. Just keep your heart open to the possibilities and watch the magic unfold."
pisces,2014-03-12,"Everything keeps looking bigger and better, yet it seems as if the reward is always just around the next bend. However, this time it really is waiting for you, assuming you are diligently working toward your goals. Although it's easy to believe you're fooling yourself, your extra efforts are very likely being noticed by someone who matters. Continue doing the best job possible without vying for any special attention. Remember, what goes around comes around, so don't give up now when the end of the rainbow is so close."
aries,2014-03-13,"Focusing on the present moment is challenging today because you may be so concerned about your future. Ironically, a recollection of something in your past might be more of a problem than whatever actually happens next. Thankfully, this confusing detour down Memory Lane can be a significant learning experience. Trust in the intelligence of now, rather than obsessing on unresolved feelings left over from your sentimental journey."
taurus,2014-03-13,"You may grow so preoccupied with one single idea that it's nearly impossible for anyone to get you to talk about anything else. Nevertheless, following others is a smart move now since they will lead you in a positive direction. Voluntarily minimizing the importance of your own thoughts is a wise tactic today and makes you more accessible to your friends and coworkers. You currently gain more through cooperation than you possibly can on your own."
gemini,2014-03-13,"You're willing to let go of your worries and dream your troubles away today, but you are also concerned about leaving loose ends untied. Unfortunately, your lack of responsibility may be an all-too-familiar theme for you. Nevertheless, this is a great opportunity to learn from your past mistakes. Forget about recreational activities until you wrap up your unfinished business. It's much easier to enjoy yourself once you have done the right thing and demonstrated your dependability."
cancer,2014-03-13,"The power of positive thought gets you off to a great start today, but you must follow up with good old-fashioned hard work. Complete all of your chores so you're able to fully enjoy the pleasures that you so richly deserve. Even if you plan a quiet evening at home, give yourself the time and space to imagine the positive changes that you want to experience in the near future. There aren't many reasons to restrain your creative vision now; if you can visualize it, chances are you can make it happen."
leo,2014-03-13,"You thought that you would be ready to make a major move today, but instead you grow more contemplative as the day wears on. You know that you should be thankful for the stable ground in your life these days, but you also are aware of those obstacles that block your progress. Nevertheless, there's no need to focus on what's wrong; concentrate on all those things that you could be doing to continue your personal growth. Slow and steady change wins out in the long run."
virgo,2014-03-13,"You might try to hide your true intentions today. Even if you're sure about your feelings, you still don't like the idea of others knowing your secrets. However, withholding information could be a serious waste of energy now, especially since your peers probably know more than you realize. Including your inner circle in your plans isn't as much of a risk as it seems. In fact, if you are willing to listen to the feedback offered, you may receive valuable advice from an unexpected source."
libra,2014-03-13,"You're tempted to express yourself in an outrageous manner today, but your common sense ultimately prevents you from going too far. If you feel resistance to your efforts to do your own thing, go ahead and fall back on your charm and grace. Be true to yourself now while also keeping your mind open to different perspectives. Relinquish your control for a little while and go along with others for the sake of group harmony."
scorpio,2014-03-13,"If you keep to yourself today, you may end up wishing you took a more social route. Breaking out of your shell requires extra effort on your part; but once you push past your own resistance, you might truly enjoy the company of others. Luckily, there's no need to hide your emotions or temper your desires now. Trust your instincts to pick just the right moment to share your feelings. Timing is everything when it comes to matters of the heart."
sagittarius,2014-03-13,"If you're buzzing around like a busy bee today, you might be too distracted to fully appreciate the camaraderie of your friends and associates. Nevertheless, there's a solid support system in place, ready to carry you to the next level if only you would let it. Allowing yourself to be vulnerable with those you trust can prove to be the exact catalyst you need. Slow down and smell the flowers right in your own backyard."
capricorn,2014-03-13,"You are taking your responsibilities quite seriously now as the Sun trines your ruling planet, somber Saturn. It may feel as if you're immersed in projects, yet you're also eager to face the new challenges ahead. Nevertheless, you're still committed to finishing the jobs you have already started. Be patient as you build on your accomplishments and wait for the opportunities to reap the rewards. Your work ethic is a shining inspiration to everyone around you."
aquarius,2014-03-13,"Other people may motivate you to start something new now, but you need to be willing to change and grow so you can maximize the current opportunities. This transformational process becomes a lot more challenging if you're unable to let go of the past. Don't cling too tightly to the status quo or you won't be able to take advantage of the amazing possibilities that are right in front of you. Open your mind and embrace the future."
pisces,2014-03-13,"You can learn a valuable lesson today by stopping to reevaluate your recent history. Paradoxically, your review process might also stimulate your anticipation of the future. Your life begins to take on a greater meaning as you see social systems bending under the pressure of change. Meanwhile, you're committed to finding stability in the midst of transition, even if you don't yet know how you will manage it. Don't worry too much about the details; you can't get lost if you follow your intuition."
aries,2014-03-14,"There is a contagious enthusiasm to your energy today, yet periodically you may sink into the cooler waters of isolationism. Fortunately, your energy level is high between these momentary bouts of discouragement, so make the most of your positive attitude while you're feeling optimistic. Balance your need for relationship security with your desire to express unusual feelings without restraint. Give those who love you a chance to accept you just the way you are."
taurus,2014-03-14,"Jumping into the wild seas of unrepressed thoughts isn't as dangerous as it sounds as long as you put on a life jacket. Taking precautions prepares you for almost anything that might come your way now. You won't drown, but you may be carried off course by the storms of experience today. Use your common sense to keep your head above water. Taking care of yourself opens up the possibility of helping others that need it, allowing you to save the day."
gemini,2014-03-14,"You could set the world afire today with your clever thoughts and winning charisma. Sometimes, your adaptable personality works well for you and sometimes it doesn't. However, you must stay conscious of your intentions now or you can lay your charm on too thick. It's easier to exert self-control early in the game than to start something that you cannot stop. It's up to you to find the fine line between superficial and sincere."
cancer,2014-03-14,"Emotional encounters stir up repressed feelings while the Moon is in your sign. Still, you're not interested in sitting in a corner brooding; nor do you want to withdraw from interpersonal engagements today. You have things to do now and people to see. Your day may not go according to plan, so don't try to hold onto your previous schedule just to prove a point. You can maintain inner stability and increase your sense of security if you are willing to change with the outer dynamics."
leo,2014-03-14,"You are wise to tread lightly today, since whatever you do will probably still create quite a noticeable impact. Unconscious patterns can overtake your day while circumstances grow out of control pretty quickly. Find someone you can trust with your deepest secrets. Unwrap your buried feelings, for they only bring you sorrow when they stay deep within. Act with courage but be gentle with your heart."
virgo,2014-03-14,"At first, you think that your day will unfold according to your plans, but unfortunately it's just not going to be that simple. Too much intensity is floating around in the atmosphere and the energy needs to go somewhere. But even with a surprise or two, you can keep things relatively under control. In fact, if you embrace the unexpected, you could turn the liability of uncertainty into a viable asset."
libra,2014-03-14,"A great idea temporarily lured you into the stratosphere but now reality has brought you back down to earth. However, your energy level is still running strong and you are psyched for whatever comes next. Considering how high-strung you are these days, it's amazing that you can be so practical in your approach. Oddly enough, the more grounded you remain, the easier it becomes to express yourself in new and exciting ways. Find your center and see what happens."
scorpio,2014-03-14,"Although you may not feel like you're a rock of stability today, there's a certain peace in knowing that you are free enough from tradition to embrace your unique idea of the future. It might seem as if you're walking a tightrope between the new and the old, but you make it look so easy now that others will respect the path you choose to travel. Take a few deep breaths, don't look down and just keep moving forward. Believe in yourself and others will follow."
sagittarius,2014-03-14,"Practical concerns require you to downplay your craziest plans now, while also acknowledging that your wild dreams are not going away. You may talk about your fantasies as you imagine your future, but don't place too much stock in anything that lacks a solid foundation or you might regret it. Ultimately, the most pragmatic approach to a radical idea will steer you in the right direction."
capricorn,2014-03-14,"Strong feelings arise as relationship dynamics shift unexpectedly and you may choose to share them instead of biting your tongue. If you are experiencing conflict with others at work today, it's best to roll with the punches instead of fighting back. Something big is about to change, and it can alter the way others see you. Try not to anticipate what's about to happen. Just allow the situation to unfold naturally without attempting to fix the outcome. Time is on your side."
aquarius,2014-03-14,"There may be so much going on at work today that it can be rather distracting. Nevertheless, you might enjoy all the activity as quicksilver Mercury activates your key planet Uranus. If life becomes overwhelming, keep in mind that the intensity will not last more than a few days. You have the potential for great originality as long as you don't try to avoid the noise. Genius is often born out of chaos."
pisces,2014-03-14,"Although you may wish you could remain invisible in a crowd today, you will still be noticed by your admirers. Others may see you as more passionate than you really feel now. You are running on intuitive energy and there is no limit to what you can do as long as you can imagine it. You will be happier if you pay less attention to everyone's expectations and listen to the signs of your heart, instead. Tune out the distractions, and channel your creativity into your art."
aries,2014-03-15,"Your desires pull you in many directions today, yet you are determined to settle on the most practical one. Although your final decision might not be your first choice, your need for efficiency grows throughout the day. But making up your mind isn't easy because circumstances tempt you with pleasurable distractions. Remember, you can do the right thing and still have fun if you set your mind to it."
taurus,2014-03-15,"A romantic attraction could hijack your day, but it might not be all fun and games because love comes with a price today. You may even feel rattled as if you're on an emotional roller coaster. Nevertheless, you need to stop for a moment to catch your breath and consider how to best meet your needs. Paradoxically, your willingness to relinquish control of the details can bring you the satisfaction you seek."
gemini,2014-03-15,"Your desires may lure you into realms of your imagination today that can't be comprehended by logic. Unfortunately, you need to rationally understand what's going on could lead to a frustrating dead-end. You find it challenging to restrict your thoughts or limit your feelings now. Of course, having valid information at your fingertips is useful, but it's time to let go of your intellectual safety net and move into an unfamiliar world that is beyond words and reason."
cancer,2014-03-15,"You love the idea of embarking on an adventure of the senses today and might even receive encouragement from your friends. However, interactions with others can stimulate powerful emotions, which in turn amplify your desires. Luckily, you don't have to worry about setting limits because something holds you back and prevents you from going too far. Enjoy your current experience for what it is, without trying to define its long-term significance. Perspective will come in due time."
leo,2014-03-15,"Staying nice may be tricky when you are also trying to be real. The good news is your passions are aroused and you feel strongly enough to share them. However, others might not want to hear what you are saying, for your position could very well be upsetting to them. For now, don't worry too much about the consequences as long as you continue to speak your truth and come from a place of love."
virgo,2014-03-15,"Relaxing and enjoying a little downtime can be difficult today when you have so much work on your plate. Although you can't avoid your responsibilities, you might be able to successfully escape for a while today if you are willing to limit your playtime. Unfortunately, overindulging won't be tolerated, especially if you let someone down by failing to fulfill your promises. On the other hand, taking a bit of time for yourself is rejuvenating and gives you the extra energy you will need in the days ahead."
libra,2014-03-15,"You may want to have a quiet day at home without doing much at all, but your reverie will likely be interrupted by circumstances beyond your control. Fortunately, these unexpected twists and turns can actually add excitement to your life. Anything that surprises you by altering your regular routine brings you unexpected joy today. Don't be so rigid in your behavior that you miss out on the potential fun knocking at your door."
scorpio,2014-03-15,"The emotional currents are wild as your two key planets, intense Pluto and impetuous Mars, take you on a bumpy ride. You're not completely in control today and you won't be able to fend off the surprises by solely relying on cool logic. Instead of fighting against the changes, you're better off jumping right into the rapid flow. Pay attention to every moment as if nothing else matters and you could be rewarded with an incredible ride and a memorable experience."
sagittarius,2014-03-15,"You are basking in the spotlight of recognition today, whether or not you have asked for all the current attention. There is a part of you that uncharacteristically might choose to work and play in the shadows now, for you realize that the best magic sometimes occurs out of sight. Nevertheless, your explorations can be most meaningful if you let someone else control the variables. An unexpected blast of light at the right moment may be exactly what you need."
capricorn,2014-03-15,"You are not interested in superficial social activities unless they directly further your personal ambitions. You don't really want to be part of the group scene now, although social obligations might impose upon you anyhow. Fortunately, you can have the best of both worlds by limiting the number of people you encounter today. It's really quite simple; interact with those around you when you must, and then kick back to enjoy your solitude when you get the chance."
aquarius,2014-03-15,"Finding free time can be quite challenging today, even if you were planning on taking the day off. However, energetic Mars is fueling artistic Venus in your sign now, and you may not have too much of a chance to rest, especially if you're on a creative jag. Nothing is gained by trying to stick to your original plan. You must be ready when inspiration strikes; if the muse comes for a visit, invite her in."
pisces,2014-03-15,"Everyone around you seems particularly picky today, as if nothing you do is good enough. However, your current lack of confidence might be negatively coloring your perceptions of others. Instead of assuming that you are letting anyone down, accept their feedback as constructive criticism now. No one wants you to fail; in fact, just the opposite. Your allies may be hard on you only because they want you to succeed. Count yourself lucky if your friends care so much."
aries,2014-03-16,"Your lack of patience messes with your plans today. You have good intentions while the Virgo Full Moon illuminates your 6th House of Daily Routine, reflecting your desire to finish your chores. But boredom sets in quickly as the Sun irritates action-hero Mars. However, it's not time to leave your current schedule behind, even if your visions of escaping are hard to resist. Don't let go of your dreams; just relegate them to the back burner for now. You can explore ways to break free once your commitments are fulfilled and your desk is clear."
taurus,2014-03-16,"Playing the role of the hopeless romantic could catalyze the chemistry within an existing relationship today or have you searching for a new one as the picky Virgo Full Moon lights up your 5th House of Love and Creativity. However, an over-analytical approach might prevent you from reaching your goals. Don't assume you know the best way to achieve happiness now. Your willingness to shift gears helps you accommodate the demands of the changing social landscape."
gemini,2014-03-16,"You normally make promises with the intent of keeping them, but today may not be a normal day. Your emotions could be at odds with other people's expectations now as the Virgo Full Moon floods your 4th House of Foundations. Something might not go exactly as you planned, giving you a bit of explaining to do. But instead of trying to rationalize your reactions, just concentrate on improving the current situation. Focus your attention on being practical and save the philosophical analysis for another day."
cancer,2014-03-16,"Your long-term goals start to shift today, leaving you floundering with uncertainty as you approach the next workweek. The Virgo Full Moon lands in your 3rd House of Information, filling your day with so many distractions that it's difficult to follow through with your previous commitments. However, changing your schedule might not be worth the stress; just do what you promised as best as you can. In the meantime, let others know what you're thinking. Putting your thoughts out on the table shakes up the dynamics and enables you to move on."
leo,2014-03-16,"You may be particularly hard on yourself today, even if you receive emotional support from others through their kind words and praise. Still, you're tempted to ignore everyone's optimism because the critical Virgo Full Moon occupies your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, precipitating a crisis if you begin to doubt your own assumptions. Don't make things more complicated than they already are; just employ the healthiest strategy possible based upon the positive feedback you hear. For a change, follow someone else's lead and your confidence will return before you know it."
virgo,2014-03-16,"How you are able to function with so much intense energy in your environment today could be a mystery, yet your satisfaction depends upon finding sensible solutions to the current problems. Today's Full Moon in your exacting sign overwhelms your analytical approach with waves of subjective feelings. Nevertheless, don't try to force any issues now. When others see how graceful you perform under pressure, they will continue to support you, whether or not you ask for their help."
libra,2014-03-16,"You might be feeling a bit discouraged today because you don't have a plan to shake off your negative energy. You want to come clean and start anew, but sharing your worries may be difficult because the Virgo Full Moon is shining in your 12th House of Secrets. Paradoxically, the more you try to express your buried feelings now, the less sense you make. It's as if you're chasing your shadow. Don't try so hard; just relax and let things unfold organically. Adopt a position of gratitude. Your happiness may be waiting around the very next corner."
scorpio,2014-03-16,"You feel spiritually refreshed and hope to take the fastest route to success now. However, hard work is still the most reliable way to get what you want. Today's Virgo Full Moon brightens your 11th House of Aspirations and activates your dreams. Forget about the ingenious ideas and clever shortcuts; stick to the tried and true methods if you want to reach your highest potential."
sagittarius,2014-03-16,"Although you may see yourself as an instigator today, you might not be causing as much trouble as you think. The earthy Virgo Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Status, giving you the impetus to dig in your heels and make a public statement based on your newfound sensible approach to life. You're not interested in turning everything upside down now; you just want to make steady progress toward your long-term goals. Your drive and determination are an inspiration to others."
capricorn,2014-03-16,"Set aside your impractical dreams of traveling around the world now that the pragmatic Virgo Full Moon rattles your 9th House of Adventure. Fortunately, you should be able to keep your mind on your work with a bit of conscious effort and wrap things up early today. Rather than flying off to a foreign land, try studying its culture or learning its language, instead. You may end up discovering there are many constructive ways to feed your wanderlust besides leaving town."
aquarius,2014-03-16,"A heated interaction with someone who doesn't appear to have your best interests in mind could be motivated by fear today. The Virgo Full Moon falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing and you might be afraid that others are trying to control you for reasons you don't understand. Fortunately, your current concerns will probably fade quickly, but you're still better off investigating further to ameliorate any lingering doubt. Be cautious in negotiations; remember, a lack of finality now won't necessarily slow you down in the long run."
pisces,2014-03-16,"You exist as a part of the greater whole, since the entire school is more important than any one fish in it. Today's Virgo Full Moon highlights your 7th House of Others, reflecting the great paradox for you sensitive Fish. You must stand up for yourself by expressing your individuality. However, you also need to stay connected to the universal spirit that flows through everyone. The key to your current success is finding a middle path by practicing moderation in everything you do."
aries,2014-03-17,"People seem to be going out of their way to be extra nice to you today, but their actions might not have the impact they expect. Even if you appreciate their efforts, you find it difficult to trust the motives of others, making it difficult to receive their gifts with an open mind. However, your fears may be more of a statement about you than anyone else. But you don't need to go to extremes and ignore all your concerns. Being aware of your own resistance allows you to see the best in everyone."
taurus,2014-03-17,"You approach your duties with an optimistic attitude today, assuming your most sincere efforts will produce positive results. Unfortunately, tangible production could fall short of your intentions because other people don't seem as industrious as you are now. You may try to gain efficiency by working on your own, but this option might not be a viable one. Don't be too concerned about losing ground; no one will fault you if you're doing the best job you can."
gemini,2014-03-17,"Concentrating on your chores may be an uphill battle today because you would rather be amusing yourself doing just about anything else. Although you might be able to successfully pull off a quick escape now, you won't likely have enough time to indulge in the pleasures you seek. But be careful; if you choose fun over work, it's quite possible you will get caught and then have to pay the price for being irresponsible. It's not worth trading long-term satisfaction for short-term pleasure."
cancer,2014-03-17,"You're lost in your own thoughts now and you can make yourself seem so invisible that others don't even notice your temporary self-absorption. You're capable of keeping up appearances today while also creating extra time to reflect on personal issues. But sustaining this type of duality is exhausting. If your temper grows short, take a break from your contemplation and channel your energy into something more tangible."
leo,2014-03-17,"You might be quite the diplomat today, voluntarily placing yourself in the middle of a conflict because you believe you can help. However, you may be quite annoyed that others are wasting time arguing when you just want to steer them into a more harmonious place. Your current strength comes from the fact that you aren't willing to take sides now, so listen to every individual's story while focusing on the common ground and not the differences. Let your natural generosity of spirit be your guide."
virgo,2014-03-17,"Your power of concentration is one of your strengths, but today might be an exception to the rule. You may have your share of details to manage, yet your mind can be rather uncooperative now. Don't set yourself up for failure by trying to accomplish too much. Instead, give yourself permission to waste a bit of time in idle fantasy. Your dreams inspire you to reach your potential in the long run."
libra,2014-03-17,"A combination of cosmic influences encourages you to join the party today, even if you know better. Thankfully, you have no problem now thinking one way while acting another. But even if you are comfortable with this inconsistency, it still could be stressful for others -- especially if your indulgent actions affect them negatively. Oddly enough, turning down the invitation and being responsible ultimately brings you the most satisfaction. There are many roads that can lead to joy as long as your heart is in the right place."
scorpio,2014-03-17,"You might feel as if an era is coming to a close, yet you're not quite ready to step into the next one yet. You may even be somewhat disoriented as you try to figure out where you are going. Although you can be uncomfortable when there are too many loose ends, it still could take a while longer before you get the closure that you need. Be patient while walking in both worlds; this transformation is a work in progress."
sagittarius,2014-03-17,"Staying present in the here and now can be challenging if you can't take your mind off the myriad of possibilities ahead. But all your weighing and judging won't make the future any more certain. Ironically, the more you ponder the decisions you must make, the muddier they seem. Nevertheless, it's still better to initiate some action today than to continue endless rounds of analysis."
capricorn,2014-03-17,"Career issues are in the spotlight today, but your frustration might build as you find it increasingly difficult to resolve a current dilemma. It seems as if everyone is telling you to make your choice, but you may see validity to more than one possible path. Even if you feel anxious under the pressure, don't succumb to the outside influence of individuals with a special interest. Stick to your position of neutrality for a while longer with as much grace as you can muster."
aquarius,2014-03-17,"You may feel the stress nearly everywhere you turn today, but oddly enough you seem to be unaffected by the noisy drama playing out around you. However, this doesn't mean that you are sailing along without any worries at all. Simply stated, you're in your airy element now and you can clearly discern what's happening in your immediate environment, enabling you to react efficiently. There's no room for self-doubt; just follow your instincts and you won't go wrong."
pisces,2014-03-17,"Your intuition allows you to perceive things that are extrasensory. Unfortunately, you could fall into your own trap today by allowing your desires to fill in the missing details as you stare into a foggy landscape. It's better to acknowledge what you can't see and leave it at that. But you're tempted to dream up a best-case scenario, project it onto your perceptions and then confuse your fantasy with reality. Being aware of your feelings can prevent your preferences from leading you astray."
aries,2014-03-18,"Although everyone seems to be doing their best to keep you calm now, you're not interested in placating anyone else. Unfortunately, sharing your hidden desires can be shocking to others, and certainly more complicated than just telling them what they expect to hear. Sometimes being direct is a good idea, but today it may make sense to take a more gentle approach. There are many ways to express your unconventional nature; however, you might have to do it alone."
taurus,2014-03-18,"Your nerves are on edge today as electric Uranus cranks up the volume on your key planet Venus. But rather than trying to contain your erratic energy, you can transform an awkward situation into one that brings a smile to your face. This is your chance to make the positive changes you want. Don't resist the adrenaline rush; ride it for all it's worth."
gemini,2014-03-18,"A sudden bolt of lightning turns your workplace upside down today. Even if the commotion adds unsolicited chaos to your life, it might turn out to be the best thing that could happen. Buried tensions are being released now, unblocking your creativity. No matter what occurs, express your inner artist however you can. An unexpected series of circumstances may just magically morph into an opportunity for personal growth."
cancer,2014-03-18,"New ideas pop into your head today but no matter how much you like them they might not fit into your long-range plans. Although you usually choose safety and security over the unknown experience of an adventure, you are more than ready to take a risk now. The potential payoff seems to justify any discomfort you might encounter along the way. Don't bother trying to rationalize your desires; just act on them. Follow your bliss and don't look back."
leo,2014-03-18,"If you recently gambled your heart, things might not be working out quite the way you hoped they would. But the energy is shifting and you have reason to believe that your efforts could still pay off. Don't give up; continue to express your emotions as honestly as possible. You can best take advantage of the current dynamics by exploring your feelings without worrying about where they lead. Happily, you may be pleasantly surprised with where you end up."
virgo,2014-03-18,"A close friend or romantic partner might catch you off guard today with his or her reckless actions. Or, perhaps you receive an unexpected invitation to participate in something you have never done before. Although you tend to be highly refined in your tastes and cautious in love, this is your opportunity to step beyond your own limitations. You won't ever know what was possible unless you break the rules, throw away the map and explore uncharted territory."
libra,2014-03-18,"Your work schedule may be disrupted today and there doesn't seem to be much you can do other than quickly adapt to the changes as they occur. Remaining flexible now means the difference between experiencing professional satisfaction and facing a temporary setback. If something happens out of the blue, just respond like the resilient willow tree; bend like a branch in the winds of change."
scorpio,2014-03-18,"Your creative genius surges today, enabling you to express your originality and brilliance -- as long as you don't try too hard. Paradoxically, the more you attempt to force the process, the less likely you are to succeed at making magic. You are being offered an important lesson in spontaneity; connect with your muse and let your inner child out to play."
sagittarius,2014-03-18,"You are often the one who starts the party or plans the big adventure, but you might try to focus on more serious endeavors in spite of all the distractions today. Even if you can tame the wild energies that are running rampant, your real nemesis could be your own unexpressed desires. Whatever remains hidden now has the potential to create unexpected conflict, so get past your fears and share what's in your heart."
capricorn,2014-03-18,"You're doing your best to keep everything at work on a fairly even keel today, but contradictory thoughts and feelings somehow still slip through your defenses and rattle your professional world. Instead of overcompensating by reverting back to a familiar agenda, find comfort in the current ambiguity. Expand your horizons by exploring options you might otherwise pass by. Even if you don't like the uncertainty at first, being flexible with your plans now increases your chances for success."
aquarius,2014-03-18,"The winds of fate are blowing up a major storm now in your 2nd House of Self-Worth, so prepare for a possible windfall. On the other hand, the upcoming shift could leave you wondering what happened, with less money in your bank account than you prefer. Either way, the changes are likely to be swift as they alter your fiscal condition. Shaking up the energy could ultimately work in your favor if you're ready to settle down and take of business."
pisces,2014-03-18,"Tell others exactly what you want, even if it's not what they wish to hear today. In fact, if you blast open the communication channels, you have a better chance of receiving your heart's true desire. However, you can easily shock someone with your weird ideas. Lay the groundwork carefully while discussing your feelings in order to allow everyone else room to draw their own conclusions. Being true to yourself now encourages others to do the same."
aries,2014-03-19,"You aren't interested in small talk today because you are more intrigued by people's hidden agendas rather than what appears on the surface. Although words come to you easily now, you might want to avoid using too many of them because they could dissipate your energy. Don't let anyone lure you into a philosophical discussion; however, fascinating it may be -- unless the topic furthers your search for truth. Expand your horizons and deepen your understanding of what's happening in your world while you have the chance."
taurus,2014-03-19,"You might have to respond to a surprising change of circumstances today but, fortunately, you see this unexpected twist of fate in a positive light. You have sufficient stamina to deal with nearly anything that crosses your path, along with an intuitive sense to know when to be patient. Trust your gut reactions and don't let analysis override your feelings. Rely on your heart instead of your brain for the best outcome now."
gemini,2014-03-19,"Although you like to have a plan in place, you often reserve the right to change your mind up to the very last moment. Sometimes coworkers don't understand your reasons for modifying your priorities, but there's almost always sound logic to your thinking. Nevertheless, make certain that you're not just taking the easy way out now. If your new and improved strategy is really better, there's no reason to hesitate or waste time justifying your actions to everyone else. You don't need to prove anything to anyone but yourself."
cancer,2014-03-19,"You may startle yourself today because of your sudden willingness to take a risk. However, gambling on a sure thing might be a smart move, even if others attempt to convince you that you're making a mistake. Unfortunately, inaction could carry a different type of consequences. The fear of personal failure isn't as motivational as the possible regret of not trying at all. Overcome your internal resistance and follow your heart."
leo,2014-03-19,"You may uncover previously untapped resources today if you're willing to fully commit to a single goal. However, it's necessary to move beyond your doubts and acknowledge that you are serious about what you want. If you're unsure of your objectives, it's wiser to wait a day or two so you can sort things out. In the meantime, don't be afraid to stubbornly hold your ground, even if you feel a big change is looming just around the corner. Only you will know when the time is right."
virgo,2014-03-19,"Choosing whether or not to go ahead with your plans is tricky because the pros and cons are pretty evenly balanced now. However, if you finally decide against pushing ahead today, you could surprise yourself by impulsively taking the next step anyway. Exercise reasonable caution; if you initiate action prematurely, you might just have to start all over next week. Doing a bit more research is a better use of your time and energy."
libra,2014-03-19,"Upsetting the status quo isn't normally your favorite thing to do, but you might actually reconsider a radical idea that inspires you today. You are intrigued by strategies to spice up a relationship that has become entrenched in routine. Unfortunately, you'll never know if they work if you don't try them at least once. Think outside of the box; you can always return to your old ways if your new approach doesn't work out."
scorpio,2014-03-19,"A creative strategy to solving a problem could lead to success on the job or, at least, recognition by your coworkers. This feels like an exciting time, but you must establish a steady and sustainable pace to make the most of it. Although you're full of bright ideas now, it isn't helpful to make a one-time big splash. Save your flashy presentations for some other day; instead, impress others by demonstrating your ability to complete whatever you start."
sagittarius,2014-03-19,"You might be able to get away with mischievous behavior today because others are likely to admire your edgy attitude. The Sun's last day in imaginative Pisces allows your philosophical nature to shine through for everyone to see. Thankfully, your willingness to risk your stability to do things your way shows your intent to succeed without sacrificing your integrity. You can still be a nonconformist while doing what's right."
capricorn,2014-03-19,"You're riding a growing wave of emotions that is motivating you to take action today. However, it may be smarter to slow down now or you could squander a rare opportunity to share your success. Being an inspirational leader can be challenging  if you're too eager to reach your destination. Don't just race ahead of those who should be following you; instead, set a pace that allows everyone to be a part of the process."
aquarius,2014-03-19,"Hiding your intentions from others is nearly impossible today with the emotional Moon's presence in your 10th House of Status. Even if you think it's a good idea to keep your feelings quiet, a surprising turn of events may require you to think on your feet while including others in your decision-making process. Sharing your dreams requires courage; however, exposing your vulnerability now removes unnecessary boundaries between you and your peers, cultivating an atmosphere of mutual admiration and respect."
pisces,2014-03-19,"Even if your feelings make total sense to you now, there still might be trouble if you tell someone what you really want. A misunderstanding could occur if you become so enthusiastic about your current strategy that you just bounce from one thought to another. A better approach is to work quietly toward your goals today while waiting to share your overall plan until you develop it further. Give yourself some time to breathe and others will be more eager to support your endeavors."
aries,2014-03-20,"You are impatient to start something new, but it makes sense to moderate your impulses now. The Sun's month-long visit to your sign boosts your vitality and provokes you to strike while the iron is hot. But instead of wasting energy on an unsuitable venture, think twice before you cannot undo what you've done. If it still seems like a good idea after some serious thought, then methodically proceed with your plan. After all, it is your time to shine."
taurus,2014-03-20,"You are feeling conflicted today because sharing your ideas with others is the next logical step in your journey. Nevertheless, something tells you that it's wiser to keep things to yourself a while longer. But your current introversion isn't about the fear of being seen; it's just that you still have some important spiritual processing to do. Don't be overly concerned if someone accuses you of being stubborn; you're actually more eager for change now than usual. Take whatever time you need to feel safe enough before coming out of your shell."
gemini,2014-03-20,"Although you rarely lack for things to do, the Sun's entry into your 11th House of Friends today marks an even busier social month ahead. You are less interested in working hard to get ahead now than enjoying the camaraderie of your buddies and coworkers. Instead of jumping through hoops to be noticed, relax and blend into the group. There's no need to stir up any more trouble than is necessary. The connections you cultivate are crucial keys to your success."
cancer,2014-03-20,"You're ready to swing into action today without any prior reflection on what you're about to do. Ironically, this spontaneous behavior goes against your typically reticent nature, but it's a tough day to wait patiently for a sign to start. Ultimately, you may choose to restrain yourself, but you still might experience frustration if you don't express your feelings one way or the other. Be open to acting out of character, for the alternatives will continue to look better as the day goes on."
leo,2014-03-20,"Last year's unfulfilled ambitions begin to fade away today as the Sun's entry into your 9th House of Big Ideas draws you into the future. However, this cosmic turning point isn't about defeat; you don't have the luxury of focusing on failure. Let go of the past and start looking toward the successes ahead. Although it may take some time to feel as if you're gaining ground, don't lose faith if you really want to reach your destination."
virgo,2014-03-20,"You might be wondering if your coworkers and friends are supporting your efforts now or if they're just pacifying you with approving nods. Unfortunately, you won't necessarily know if someone is currently working against your progress. However, it may be a waste of time and energy trying to figure it out, anyway. Just be patient and wait until you're given the green light. In the meantime, it's more important to enjoy yourself while working toward your goals today than it is to reach them."
libra,2014-03-20,"Libra is the relationship sign and you are likely drawn toward working and playing with others more than most. But a friend or partner might suggest that it's time to do something on your own today. Don't think of this as a rejection; there's probably nothing personal about it at all. It's just part of the evolution of any long-term connection. Once you reestablish your own center, it will be even more fruitful to reunite and share your experiences with each other later on."
scorpio,2014-03-20,"Seeing so many options in front of you while realizing that your path has already been chosen is frustrating now. But even a slight improvement in the weather could be enough of a reason to set responsibilities aside and go out to play. Unfortunately, the timing isn't right because you cannot escape your obligations today. Anyway, you'll be able to have more fun later once your work is done and your conscience is clear."
sagittarius,2014-03-20,"You're probably quite pleased with yourself now because your creative energy is running so strong. It's easier than ever to express yourself however you may choose today. But something still prevents you from having as much fun as you expected. Letting go of previous assumptions might help, yet the ultimate solution comes with time. There's no need to be in such a hurry; slow down so you can truly appreciate the present moment."
capricorn,2014-03-20,"You don't react well to someone leaning on you to make a quick decision. In fact, you could become downright argumentative if you have to defend your right to move at your own speed, rather than follow another person's arbitrary schedule. However, turning this difference of opinion into an open conflict is not a smart idea and won't bring you any closer to your heart's desire. Loosen up; exercising flexibility in response to external demands can flip a difficult situation around to your advantage."
aquarius,2014-03-20,"You may find yourself juggling conflicting agendas today. You need some downtime and might think that working on your own is the smartest way to get it. But you don't want to miss your chance to learn from the people in your immediate environment. Unfortunately, there's no way to be alone and with others simultaneously. You can, however, benefit from the best of both worlds if you alternate your approach throughout the day. Stealing a few minutes at a time could be all you need to take care of your personal matters."
pisces,2014-03-20,"It might appear as if others are just beginning their big projects, yet you already started yours a while back. Take your efforts to the next level by creating more structure in your life. This could involve a unique approach to allocating your time. Instead of focusing on an inspirational or creative process, increase productivity by prioritizing your tasks and then doing them methodically, one after another. It's time to make your dreams come true."
aries,2014-03-21,"On one hand, your reality can mysteriously blend with fantasy today, making it hard to tell the difference. On the other hand, the Moon's move into fiery Sagittarius rejuvenates your spirit and inspires you to think big. Your energy is irrepressible, even if you don't know exactly where you're going. Patience serves you better now than blindly pushing ahead; you don't have to act on every whim unless you want to stir up trouble."
taurus,2014-03-21,"The wide-open spaces in front of you may be a bit daunting because it's nearly impossible to know which opportunities make the most sense now. Fortunately, you can rely on your friends and colleagues for the guidance you need today. Listen to what they have to say, even if you aren't sure that they truly understand your interests. You can greatly benefit from the wisdom of experience if you remain open to the helpful advice. Just remember that the final choice is still yours to make."
gemini,2014-03-21,"You might not run into any obstacles today, yet slowing down is a wise strategy anyhow. Emotional issues can present problems, even in the most cooperative relationships. You may feel as if you are split in two, with your heart telling you one thing now while circumstances require you to act differently. Don't try to solve the dilemma yet; just be aware of the source of stress. Taking full responsibility for your own feelings makes it easier for everyone involved."
cancer,2014-03-21,"Even if you have been a bit too anxious recently, you may feel the soothing waves of contentment wash up on your shores today. Somehow, you can see the whole picture more clearly now and you're happy to do anything that fits into the larger plan. Unfortunately, you could get caught up in the excitement, committing to more than you're able to deliver. Taking careful baby steps is a better approach than running too fast and falling down."
leo,2014-03-21,"Although you might attempt to remain confident today, you continue to gain awareness of complex feelings that you were hiding from yourself. Perhaps you remember a particular event from your childhood or maybe someone shares a deep secret with you. Either way, you probably feel more vulnerable now than you prefer. Don't push away the uncomfortable emotions since they can work as an amazing catalyst to your next phase of growth. You don't have to perform to impress others with your courage."
virgo,2014-03-21,"You may believe that someone is being manipulative in their dealings with you today, giving you plenty of justification to withdraw. Paradoxically, you might consider your retreat as an act of kindness; if you don't walk away from the situation now, you could lash out and say something that hurts others. But one person's bad behavior doesn't need to ruin it for you and everyone else. Find a way to maintain your boundaries without turning into a hermit and spoiling all the fun."
libra,2014-03-21,"Knowing how to respond to circumstances at work grows more difficult as the day wears on. Your beliefs may be called into question today, especially if you rely on them to rationalize your current actions. Stick with the facts; don't let your subjectivity color your decisions. Be as fair-minded as possible now when separating the truth from the fiction. Others will appreciate your honest approach and sincere intentions."
scorpio,2014-03-21,"Your search for meaning takes top priority once the Moon enters philosophical Sagittarius. Nevertheless, you also wish you could forget about your troubles and have a good time today. Even if you are often quite serious about your spiritual journey, laughter may be the best medicine for your soul now. Instead of looking for answers in the shadows, it's time to let your dreams play in the light."
sagittarius,2014-03-21,"Being connected to a deeper source of inspiration can be tricky business for you today, since your tendency is to put a positive spin on everything you do. However, your current path may drive you into the hidden realms of your own emotions, confusing an already complex situation. Instead of isolating yourself from others now, try sharing your feelings even if it makes you more vulnerable. It's okay to open your heart as long as it's with someone you trust."
capricorn,2014-03-21,"Instead of basing your decisions on concrete information today, you may be better off paying more attention to your dreams now than to hard data. Obviously, it's foolish to ignore the facts, but you can quickly see that they don't tell the entire story. If you act on your intuition, don't waste energy worrying about the judgment of others. Ultimately, your integrity speaks for itself."
aquarius,2014-03-21,"You might uncover a misunderstanding over money matters today, but a bit of extra attention should quickly put the situation to rest. Perhaps you took action on something you thought to be true, only to later discover that you don't have all of the numbers in front of you. If you feel overwhelmed or unsure of your next move now, ask your friends and coworkers for advice. They will offer you immeasurable support and help you put your financial affairs in order."
pisces,2014-03-21,"You feel as if you're drifting in a thick fog today, but others still see you as a person who knows what he or she wants and how to get it. Nevertheless, strong emotional currents are pulling you in a variety of directions that confuse your navigational process. Don't worry about the lack of visibility now; trust your moral compass and have faith that you will arrive safely at your still-unknown destination."
aries,2014-03-22,"Your enthusiasm might be so strong that you could plow your way through a challenging situation on blind optimism and faith alone. However, your emotions are so intense today that you can work yourself into a frenzy before checking out the facts. Obviously, it's healthier and less destructive to take a gentler approach. The only reasons to fight now are imagined ones, so mellow out and escape into the company of your friends. Put down your warrior shield and channel your energy into something (or someone) that ignites your passion, instead."
taurus,2014-03-22,"When the going gets tough, you stubborn Bulls can become more determined than ever. You're not likely one to take no for an answer, so you push harder and dig in deeper, instead. However, you may forget what your goal is in your haste to make progress today. Don't worry if you feel temporarily lost because it won't last long; it isn't your style to drift aimlessly in confusion. But it's your imagination now, not your single-mindedness, that inspires you to overcome nearly any obstacle in your path."
gemini,2014-03-22,"Clear thoughts grow fuzzy around the edges now that your planet Mercury hooks up with nebulous Neptune. You might have to fight a growing urge to escape from the boring restraints of your life because running from them won't help your cause. Instead, you need to practice patience to reach your long-term goals. Although it may be difficult to maintain a slow and steady pace today, adopting a more methodical approach is the main ingredient in your current recipe for success."
cancer,2014-03-22,"You may be feeling out of sorts today as the cosmic currents pull you into the unbound expanses of the oceans of experience. Open spaces can make you nervous because you often prefer the safety of a familiar cove. On one hand, you're free to explore new territory and your thoughts can float unencumbered by old fears. On the other hand, the lack of structure confuses you, leaving you slightly disoriented. Stop resisting the inevitable; fully embrace this adventure, instead. You never know what you might learn along the way."
leo,2014-03-22,Finding a workable balance between your outer intensity and your fertile imagination may be an ongoing challenge today. Your optimism motivates you to aspire to the potential greatness that stands in front of you. But there is danger lurking in your current tendency to gloss over significant details as you push relentlessly toward your goal. A bit of caution is advised now; if you acknowledge your limitations first you have a much better chance of reaching your dreams.
virgo,2014-03-22,"It's a time of paradoxes for you meticulous Virgos because you're expecting to uncover plenty of facts to support your opinions. But with spacey Neptune conjuncting your planet Mercury today, you're pulled into the nebulous sea of dreams and away from the precision-guided world you prefer to work in. You may be inspired to follow your intuition now rather than limiting yourself with logic. However, don't wander too far off the map. Find a middle path that allows you to stay in contact with both ends of the spectrum so you don't lose your way."
libra,2014-03-22,"You are traveling through the hazy twilight zone of logic and your thoughts are drifting off into space. Thankfully, there is no danger if you can trust the fantastic ideas that now come your way. It's in your nature to balance the cosmic opposites, but sometimes you have a tough time making up your mind. Now you can make a decision, but might not be able to justify it to others. This is artistic and romantic inspiration at its best. Just don't confuse it with reality."
scorpio,2014-03-22,"Embrace the future today, even if you can't see what's around the next corner. Dance to the music, even if you don't know where it's coming from. Find your own inner optimist and ask for the guidance you need. There is magic all around you, and being aware of it is a good start. Don't worry about other people's expectations now. Your job is to transform the obvious insolvable dilemma into a situation that works to your benefit -- and maybe even creating something mysteriously beautiful in the process."
sagittarius,2014-03-22,"No matter how confident you are today, you still might have to contend with a temporary wave of self-doubt. There may appear to be a deep and impenetrable fog between you and your goals. Your spiritual beliefs can help you cope, as long as you don't try to overpower the uncertainty you now face. Instead, transform your vulnerability into compassion and your confusion into flexibility. Focus on your inner work rather than pushing to succeed in the outer world. Peace of mind comes from within."
capricorn,2014-03-22,"Oddly enough, exploring your imagination today enables you to find the emotional energy to climb the mountain that is looming in front of you. Sink beneath the surface reality into your own fantasy world, for this is where the answers lay hidden from view. Use the dreams that arise from your subconscious mind in order to paint the future as you wish it to be. Whatever you do now -- don't believe what you see; instead, see what you believe."
aquarius,2014-03-22,"You hold the key to the future in your dreams. You are like the wise shaman who is channeling visions and others may seek your guidance today, whether you want the role or not. This responsibility might temporarily restrict your ability to be independent, for there are serious duties that fall on your shoulders now. Don't try to escape this spiritual calling. If people are relying on you, do whatever you can to hold up your end of the deal. The positive impact you have on those who trust you will ripple back to you many times over."
pisces,2014-03-22,"Your picture of a perfect world may be so vivid that you're dismayed when you realize how far removed it is from your current circumstances today. However, it isn't always bad news when the clouds of illusion rain down to Earth because this is where the tires meet the road of life. And this is when your real work begins. You have experienced both sides: you have imagined the fantasy and you have seen the naked truth. Now it's time to create a magical path that allows you to travel freely between these two interrelated worlds."
aries,2014-03-23,"You're willing to work hard in order to keep things from falling apart today. However, your efforts might be futile because your life grows more complex when you succeed. It's like a video game where you're promoted to the next screen once you finish the current level; this is a sign that it's time for an entirely new strategy. Instead of wasting your resources on maintaining control, simply stop playing for a while. Surprisingly, relinquishing your authority now may be a lot easier than you think."
taurus,2014-03-23,"You normally think things all the way through before you say what's on your mind. However, you may be feeling on edge now, especially if you are trying to keep a secret since hiding something only makes you more anxious. Thankfully, there's little reason to worry about upsetting others today; it makes more sense to concern yourself with your own motives, instead. The details of your message aren't all that important as long as your intentions are honorable and you speak from your heart."
gemini,2014-03-23,"You might inadvertently dig your hole a little deeper instead of successfully doing damage control for something you recently said or did. Unfortunately, you can still trigger someone's anger now, even with the best of intentions. Of course, your sincere apology could work wonders, but it only has impact if you actually mean it. Keep in mind today's little drama may still take another day to play out before your relationship world stops spinning."
cancer,2014-03-23,"Backing down from a confrontation might be challenging today, even if it would be to your advantage if you did. You may feel as if you are beyond the point of no return now, which encourages you to take a risk for the sake of your beliefs. Luckily, you don't have as much to lose as you think. Just be certain that the current issue is really significant before you jeopardize what you have already gained. Choose your battles wisely to conserve your energy for when you need it most."
leo,2014-03-23,"Your plan of attack may be an impressive one, but it certainly isn't perfect. When your current situation changes, you must be willing to adapt or you could lose your competitive edge. Unfortunately, you're more rigid in your thinking than you realize, and your refusal to modify your agenda might alienate your closest friends. Be sensitive to the reactions of others so you can respond intelligently, instead of stubbornly holding onto a fading dream for no reason at all."
virgo,2014-03-23,"Although you may feel nervous today, you should be able to transform your uncomfortable tension into useful productivity. Throw away your old expectations and admit that you haven't a clue where you are going. Nevertheless, it's okay to say what's on your mind, even if it places you in a socially awkward position. Remain open to a completely different approach and then confidently follow your new plan to its successful conclusion."
libra,2014-03-23,"You're likely to receive cooperation and support today, but it might not arrive in the manner you prefer. It may even seem as if your best friend or partner is working against your best interest, but that's not what is actually occurring. Everyone appears to be marching to their own drummers now and you would be smart to encourage them. Your friends and colleagues will show up on their own schedules to help as long as you give them the latitude they need."
scorpio,2014-03-23,"You might experience a much-needed breakthrough on the financial front today, but you still need to scale your plans back prior to initiating action. Fortunately, you aren't afraid to try something radical you haven't done yet. You are so quick to learn new techniques now that others are surprised by your adaptability even if they can't grasp the complexity of your life. Although you are tempted to accomplish a lot, it's best not to bite off more than you can chew."
sagittarius,2014-03-23,"Everyone believes they know just what you're feeling today because the unabashed Sagittarius Moon inspires you to wear your heart on your sleeve for all to see. There are no easy escape routes now, for ignoring your emotions only feeds them and gives them additional strength. Your best strategy is to express what's in your heart to a trusted friend on a regular basis to keep the drama at a minimum. Don't let your fear of rejection get in the way of a meaningful dialogue."
capricorn,2014-03-23,"Although instability continues to plague you now, you still want everything running like a precision watch. You prefer not to worry where to focus your attention today, but you can't forget about your responsibilities and just turn your back on your work. Nevertheless, it makes sense to wait and see which way the currents of change are flowing before you take irrevocable action. Following your heart will not steer you wrong, but it might take some time to reach your destination."
aquarius,2014-03-23,"You probably have way too much on your plate now, and it may be necessary to lean on your closest friends for support. You're quite surprised when others rush to your assistance so quickly, demonstrating to you that you're not alone. Nevertheless, you need to be careful about how you communicate or you might annoy someone with your sarcastic humor. Slow down and think before you speak. Expressing your genuine appreciation makes everyone feel good about helping out."
pisces,2014-03-23,"You grow more pensive throughout the day, which might mean that you don't do much at all today. However, exercising self-restraint when it comes to starting new projects isn't a reason to also suppress your emotions. Spending some time alone gives you a chance to process the most meaningful content from your daydreams. Contemplation is productive as long as you keep your feelings flowing. The source of your strength comes from your vivid imagination and your receptive heart."
aries,2014-03-24,"If your life has recently taken a serious turn, adopting a sensible approach to your current responsibilities helps you make the most of this challenging day. Don't try to sidestep any emotional intensity now because your feelings can teach you something useful about yourself. The more you're able to concentrate on what you need today, the more effective you are in overcoming your own resistance to change. Demonstrating your willingness to face the issues inspires others to do the same."
taurus,2014-03-24,You are truly a force to be reckoned with because you can accomplish nearly anything you set your mind on today. But making choices is still a bit overwhelming because you're aware of the significance of your current decisions. You can breathe a bit easier if you simply remember that the most practical course of action is now the most intelligent one. It's not wise to take any foolish risks; patience works in your favor. One small step at a time will lead you to a promising future.
gemini,2014-03-24,"You may seem somewhat contentious to those around you today, but you're truly not looking to create any additional conflict. It's just that you might not take the time to think about the impact of your words now. You know you're telling the truth, so you believe it's unnecessary to stop and consider that you could be stirring up a hornet's nest. Remember, everyone doesn't need to know everything that you do. A little compassionate discretion will go a long way to keep the peace."
cancer,2014-03-24,"You could be impressed by a coworker's level of commitment today, even if your plan is completely different. But if you enter into a debate with those who oppose your ideas now, your frustration builds and can eventually outweigh any admiration you might have had. You would be wise to keep an open mind while discussing the merits of the various alternatives on the table. Nevertheless, it's never advisable to negotiate away your core values."
leo,2014-03-24,"Don't be surprised if you are the brunt of someone's anger because you're not the easiest person in the world to get along with today. You may even engage in a public confrontation with a coworker now, which creates additional problems. Although an argument causes unwanted stress, others will respect you for standing up for yourself as long as you don't take it too far. Paying attention to the cues of those around you could help you dissipate the tension before it reaches a boiling point."
virgo,2014-03-24,"Sometimes it's nearly impossible to sort through all the details. However, you are the one who seems to be able to put enough of the small pieces of a puzzle together today so you can see the big picture. People depend on your holistic thinking now, so there's no reason to hold back when sharing your advice. Trust your intuition but don't lose sight of your common sense; your moral compass will lead you in the right direction."
libra,2014-03-24,"You have something important on your mind today, but it's not that simple to share it with your peers. Every time you approach the topic, others appear to grow uncomfortable and change the subject. However, you can see things that are not apparent to anyone else and you're not willing to pretend that you know less than you do. Remember, if you're going to be the one who sounds the alarm, at least do it with kindness and without blame. Choose your words carefully so you don't alienate your audience."
scorpio,2014-03-24,"Your closest friends may attempt to avoid you for a while today because they can tell you have something on your mind that they aren't ready to hear. Meanwhile, the Moon's conjunction with powerful Pluto bolsters your emotional intensity and emboldens your courage. Just remember that your words might be more searing than you realize if you let them pass your lips uncensored. A little self-restraint makes a lot of difference in the successful delivery of your message. A spoonful of sugar helps the medicine go down."
sagittarius,2014-03-24,"You're so passionate about your beliefs today that you temporarily forget about the facts. However, others won't let you get away with sloppy thinking now and they continue to confront you with the truth. Rather than becoming overly defensive and taking a stand based on self-righteousness, make every attempt to listen to what is actually being said. This is not about you -- or anyone else -- being right or wrong; it's about keeping an open mind and finding clarity on a subject. Sometimes it takes a village to get it right."
capricorn,2014-03-24,"You want to make sure that everyone knows exactly where you stand on a controversial issue today as the evocative Moon connects with ruthless Pluto in your 1st House of Personality. You're ready to express your passionate perspective every chance you get. But a volcano derives its strength from the intense heat that is simmering beneath the surface. Likewise, you have a chance to increase your power by choosing what to say on your own terms. Carefully controlling your message gives you the chance to create the impact you desire."
aquarius,2014-03-24,"People may stir up trouble today by accusing you of something you didn't do. You might feel personally attacked or even betrayed by someone you once trusted. Unfortunately, it's probably too late now to return to the way things were. Even if your pride is hurt, think twice before retaliating because your unrestrained anger could escalate a minor problem into a major conflict. Step back and count to ten before you say something you'll quickly regret. Take the high road and see who follows."
pisces,2014-03-24,"You might not have the ability to accomplish your long-term goals on your own, but you have access to all the tools you need once you recognize that the resources are within your network of friends and associates. Keep in mind that no one person is the center of authority now, so you could lose control as soon as you attempt to consolidate it. Remember, cooperation is much more effective than any attempts at global domination. Your success is all but assured when you realize that you are part of a greater whole and act accordingly."
aries,2014-03-25,"You are caught between two different ways to manage the energy of your day. On one hand, you have work that must be completed and others are depending on you to follow through on your promises. On the other hand, you have your own desires that cannot be easily suppressed. Instead of trying to ignore your needs, do a balancing act between the two extremes. Don't blow off your responsibilities, but be sure to schedule some time to explore your dreams, too."
taurus,2014-03-25,"You want meaningful connections with your peers now that the Moon is traveling through your 9th House of Higher Truth. However, it might help to find someone special who shares your goals. In spite of your high hopes, it's not easy to let go of your relationship concerns, which could place unnecessary boundaries between you and a friend. Instead of allowing your fears to get in the way, be willing to talk about your feelings. Once the ice is broken, take the path that opens up in front of you."
gemini,2014-03-25,"Unchangeable circumstances prevent you from sharing everything that's in your heart today, even if you want to take a relationship to the next level. Unfortunately, you must watch what you say now or you could create an uncomfortable situation. Keep in mind that there's more time than you think to deliver your message. If you sense any awkward energy, just let it rest for a day or two before reactivating any kind of romantic pursuit. Timing is everything when it comes to matters of the heart."
cancer,2014-03-25,"Figuring out what to do is challenging today because your natural rhythms are disrupted by something that's completely out of your control. Naturally, your self-confidence empowers you to find your way, but you must settle for less comfort than you normally prefer. Keep in mind that whatever occurs now is a small part of the larger shift that continues to unfold during the months ahead. Your positive attitude is key to your success."
leo,2014-03-25,"Even if you're sure you know what you want today, it's still not easy to determine the most reliable way to get it. Your thoughts may be stuck on sweet pleasures that are hard to come by at this time. You might believe that everything will ultimately be okay in spite of your insecurities about how to proceed in your pursuit of happiness. Don't be distracted by external circumstances now; instead, seek joy from within."
virgo,2014-03-25,"You might feel pleased with your cautious approach to self-expression today. Your current obligations actually give you a solid framework of safety, establishing limits that are already being placed upon your time. Even if you long for something more spontaneous, it's still easy to settle back into the emotional security of your predetermined schedule. It's okay to wait until you are ready; there's no need to rush the inevitable. Trust your intuition to tell you when the moment is right."
libra,2014-03-25,"You may feel as if you are on an emotional see-saw and are weary of the extremes that exist in your life. Obtaining what you want is fraught with delays these days as Mars continues its retrograde dance in your diplomatic sign. Unfortunately, jumping off a ride while it's still in motion is significantly trickier than getting on it in the first place. Do everything necessary to keep your hopes and dreams alive, but proceed carefully so you don't upset the current balance."
scorpio,2014-03-25,"You have ideas about what is possible now, but there are still so many hurdles to jump over before winning the race. You might actually succeed if you focus on your destination rather than taking a shortcut to avoid an unstable situation. Remember, setting ambitious goals is not problematic as long as you make certain that they are sufficiently supported by verifiable facts. It's great to dream big but you still must do the work to make the magic happen."
sagittarius,2014-03-25,"The truth could precipitate a storm today, yet if it does, the results probably won't be as bad as you think. Actually, this clearing of the air may be your big chance to see things as they are, rather than as you wish them to be. When your dreams diverge from reality, it's crucial to know the details so you can make intelligent decisions. Pay extra attention to the little signs as you search for clues about what to do next."
capricorn,2014-03-25,"Change is in the air, especially with the moody Moon back in your productive sign; however, circumstances beyond your control still make you nervous. Of course you want to stabilize your feelings, but there's too many unrelated events happening simultaneously today. Instead of trying to do the impossible, take a deep breath and step back from the chaos. The energy will become more manageable once you give up the idea of being in charge of everything."
aquarius,2014-03-25,"You might wish you had more time to relax or meditate today but your busy schedule probably won't allow it. You're unable to stop your mind from spinning around and around in circles, leaving you with little time for anything else. Unfortunately, there is just too much going on now for you to ignore your responsibilities. Don't be so hard on yourself if you can't do everything; after all, you're only human. Practicing self-acceptance is your best path to inner peace."
pisces,2014-03-25,"You are eager to put your best foot forward today, but you continue to fall short of your own high expectations because you keep getting caught up in everyone else's dramas. If you attempt to retreat, your friends grow concerned about your well-being -- which, in turn, adds to the intensity you're already trying to avoid. It's tricky walking the fine line between feeling compassion for others and taking care of your own needs. Thankfully, a deeper stability is beginning to emerge if you simply let it happen."
aries,2014-03-26,"You don't have a lot to say today because your most important thoughts are too complicated to put into words. You're not particularly interested in getting ahead now; you prefer spending your time wandering through your daydreams. Do whatever is necessary to keep up outside appearances, but don't be overly concerned about your current lack of ambition. Your need for action will return before you know it. In the meantime, let your imagination run the show."
taurus,2014-03-26,"You want everyone to see you as a caring friend now, but you would rather display your affection in non-emotional ways. Your ability to listen and respond in a compassionate manner could win someone's heart, but you're oddly disassociated from the outcome of your interactions. Fortunately, this detachment favors business over personal communication; just make sure that you read the fine print prior to signing any contracts. You're good to go as long as you are authentic in all you do."
gemini,2014-03-26,"You may be sending out mixed messages, but for some reason you're able to get away with it today. Instead of calling you out because you're being duplicitous, others admire the integrity with which you maintain your professionalism. However, too many details are slipping through the cracks now, making it obvious your heart isn't in your work. Gracefully retreat until you have enough time to sort out your feelings and figure out what you want."
cancer,2014-03-26,"It's usually a bit unnerving when you sense an emotional gulf between you and a loved one, but today you might actually prefer the breathing room. You may choose to keep your feelings to yourself, so others won't even notice anything is wrong. You can hide your insecurities, but it's still healthier to confront your fears now and discuss the distance you perceive instead of pretending that all is well. Silence breeds discontent; communication leads to a closer connection."
leo,2014-03-26,"You're buzzing with optimism today, making it difficult to see the potential pitfalls in your current plans. Although the power of positive thinking can carry you a long way, it won't necessarily win out over inaccurate assumptions or faulty logic. Avoid overcompensating by acting like everything is fine if it's not; actually, an honest assessment of the pros and cons improves your chances for success."
virgo,2014-03-26,"Nearly everyone seems to be more upbeat than you today, and you're not sure why. At first, it seems great that others are so enthusiastic about your plans. But after a while, it's hard to tell if they really like your ideas or they're just saying nice things to make you feel better about yourself. Save your worry and cynicism for another day; for now, gratefully accept any support you receive at face value and continue moving your agenda forward one step at a time."
libra,2014-03-26,"Changes are being made at work, creating new opportunities for your future if you're up for the challenge. Thankfully, your job doesn't feel as tedious now; in fact, you're able to express your creativity as the clever Mercury-Jupiter alignment encourages you to open your heart in a new direction. You're poised for success as long as you're ready to believe in yourself. Don't think about it too much; just spread your wings and fly."
scorpio,2014-03-26,"The sky is the limit today and there's really no reason to scale back your vision of the future. Your plans for an adventure that seemed too crazy yesterday may have already overcome several hurdles on its way to manifestation. But don't fall into the trap of getting too comfortable. Anything that keeps you on edge now plays a pivotal role in your current motivation. Make a splash and do something completely out of the box. The more outrageous your scheme, the better your possibilities."
sagittarius,2014-03-26,"You may be so over-the-top confident today that you're ready to share nearly anything -- even your darkest secrets. Your emotions are uncontainable as loquacious Mercury harmonizes with boisterous Jupiter. However optimistic you feel now, think twice about what you're going to say before you actually open your mouth. Your inner strength shines through no matter what, especially when you use the wisdom of enlightened self-restraint. If your message is worthy, there's no need to shout it from the rooftop."
capricorn,2014-03-26,"Your patience is being tested now as everyone around you encourages you to just say yes. Meanwhile, you want to take your time and evaluate each invitation and idea that is presented to you. But they all sound so good you may choose to immediately accept, even if your calendar is already booked. Thankfully, you have plenty of experience juggling many things at once. Nevertheless, your life runs smoother if you pace yourself by delaying the start of some projects for a few more days."
aquarius,2014-03-26,"It's easy to pour on the sweetness today, but charm is not a substitute for sound thinking. Luckily, you're on a roll and you are able to coordinate all the pieces to make things happen just as you envision it. But remember that logic will only take you so far; imagination, on the other hand, inspires others and carries you anywhere you want to go. Don't stop believing; if you can dream it with enough clarity, you can make it real."
pisces,2014-03-26,"You might be a real motor-mouth today and, in fact, once you start talking, it's nearly impossible to shut up. Mercury the Messenger is visiting your 1st House of Personality, prompting you to share your opinions with anyone who will listen. And giant Jupiter's superconductive trine to Mercury emboldens you to inflate your ideas and prattle on incessantly about them. Don't waste this excellent opportunity to shine on idle chatter; create your special brand of magic, instead."
aries,2014-03-27,"You don't want to work alone now, even if you usually prefer to run ahead of the pack. The receptive Moon's visit to your 11th House of Groups links your feelings to other members of your social network or the entire group, itself. However, you could end up feeling rejected if someone doesn't want you to be part of the team. But there's no reason to hold onto a grudge; you'll feel better about things tomorrow if you keep a positive attitude today."
taurus,2014-03-27,"You possess an uncanny ability to know what to do at work now, even if your ideas seem to go against the prevailing opinions. Don't waste energy attempting to prove that your way makes the most sense now. Your coworkers probably won't believe you anyhow. Fortunately, you know your job better than anyone else, so quietly get busy putting your plan into place. You'll gain respect and admiration once everyone realizes that you mean business. This is your opportunity to shine."
gemini,2014-03-27,"Although you're not often at a loss for words, you're willing to keep quiet and go along with the general consensus now -- even if you disagree with it. You might consider putting up a fight at first, but will probably acquiesce to the majority for the sake of harmony. Fortunately, nothing is written in stone today, so allow external situations to determine your next step. You really don't have to push so hard to prove your worth."
cancer,2014-03-27,"You might be in an odd state of confusion because you want to be emotionally closer to those you love but ironically, they could choose to put a little bit of distance between you now. Naturally, this imbalance is stressful, so it's wise to reevaluate your feelings before it's too late. Ultimately, it's not just about maintaining the status quo; it's about getting what your heart desires. Try not to take things too personally today since all relationships have their own ebb and flow; focus on pursuing your dreams, instead."
leo,2014-03-27,"Ideas are popping up like flowers today and your senses are awakening to the smell of spring in the air. Nevertheless, knowing how far to take your unorthodox thoughts is challenging now, for saying too much might have negative consequences on your current lifestyle. Remember that you don't need to share everything that crosses your mind. Consider your audience before you spill all of your secrets. If anyone asks a question, a mysterious smile might be all you need for an answer."
virgo,2014-03-27,"Letting off a little hot air doesn't do a thing to further your ambitions today. However, you can use the current delays to your advantage. Instead of running off in search of a different job that meets your expectations, stay on the same track for a while longer. In the meantime, keep your options open by working several disparate threads into one complex master plan. Your chances for success are great as long as you keep your eye on the final prize."
libra,2014-03-27,"Approaching your work with a fair-minded attitude and a healthy dose of logic is unusually challenging today. However, it may not pay to be overly practical, for it's the most radical ideas that now produce the best solutions. Don't waste time trying to maintain the balance as you decide your next move. Shaking everything up brings a wider variety of choices than cautiously staying on the straight and narrow path. Sometimes taking a leap of faith is the best way to create positive change."
scorpio,2014-03-27,"You have a different strategy to managing minor problems at home today. Instead of practicing a hands-off policy, you are ready to jump in and take control of anything that's out of whack. But exerting too much authority could backfire now, especially if you don't have all the facts at your disposal. Step back and play the role of a researcher by listening carefully to everyone's opinions. Luckily, you can save the day by putting all the pieces of the puzzle together. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
sagittarius,2014-03-27,"You might feel like you're putting out one to many fires today with the emotional Moon traveling through your 3rd House of Communication. It's a struggle keeping up with so many separate interactions, yet you may not understand how one relationship pattern affects another. However, rest assured that nothing happens in a vacuum. Take the time to consciously connect with others and don't worry if you can't find all the answers just yet."
capricorn,2014-03-27,"Reexamining your motives and adjusting your goals accordingly helps to make your path easier to navigate. But your intentions might not be as clear as you think now, so you need to start the process by making a vigilant effort to untangle your subconscious desires. Don't be afraid to confide in someone; the advice you receive from a counselor, a life coach or a trustworthy friend can make all the difference in the world today as you prepare for your journey. It's a sign of strength to know when to ask for help."
aquarius,2014-03-27,"You may be overly sensitive to little things today as the high-strung Aquarius Moon brings your emotions right up to the surface and into full view. But don't force anything because you might not have enough time to delve into a significant issue now. In the meantime, just observe your reactions, and open and close your heart when appropriate. You will do best in the long run if you can wait a while longer before attempting to sort out your feelings. In the meantime, demonstrate your love through your actions and not your words."
pisces,2014-03-27,"It feels like you're walking through a dreamworld  and the surreal symbolism sticks with you throughout the day. The problem is that the lingering images don't make sense to your rational mind; as soon as you try to explain your thoughts today, they vanish in an instant. Cultivate your dreams by giving yourself permission to wander down the rabbit hole now, even if you're not sure where it leads."
aries,2014-03-28,"It doesn't seem fair if you have to address an unpleasant issue that you thought was already handled. Nevertheless, you can't let go of your concern if someone abuses a position of power. You're likely to fight for an underdog now, even if you have nothing personal to gain. If you attempt to turn the situation to your advantage today, your efforts might backfire and won't accomplish anything positive. Thankfully, working for the benefit of all produces more fulfilling results."
taurus,2014-03-28,"You might want to speak up for someone at work today, but be careful about assuming that other people's goals are in alignment with yours. The differences between you are not apparent at first glance, but start to grow obvious as you become more involved. Don't take a position that you can't personally support or you may have to back down and let your coworkers fend for themselves. Rallying to the defense of your peers is admirable as long as you know your limits."
gemini,2014-03-28,"Making a choice between taking care of your personal needs or handling a relationship issue at work is tricky business today. Your career objectives might be in a state of flux, making the dilemma even more complex. It's difficult enough to decide what you want for yourself; adding others to the mix just increases your anxiety. Alleviate the pressure by giving yourself as much time as you need to reevaluate your current priorities. In the meantime, turning on the charm allows you to play both sides of the fence for a while longer."
cancer,2014-03-28,"You may unwittingly be a part of a coworker's power play today, yet your instincts could warn you of a potential problem before it fully manifests. Although you can prevent an unnecessary confrontation by sharing your feelings, you must communicate in a manner that avoids any accusatory words. Just casting light on someone's secret agenda might be enough to turn the tables in the right direction. Let everyone know that you believe honesty is the best policy and see what happens next."
leo,2014-03-28,"You could be misunderstood today when something you say with the best of intentions is interpreted as a grab for power. But you're not interested in usurping anyone else's authority now; you just want things done the correct way and may believe it's necessary to intervene before anything goes awry. Don't be too authoritative in your approach; be patient and explain your motives as clearly as possible. Once you've spoken your piece, simply let events take their own course."
virgo,2014-03-28,"Although a coworker or friend may seem unsure of the current dynamics in your relationship now, the confusion could be all yours. Perhaps you are seeking more clarity than is possible at this time. Ironically, your insistence on having more information might actually cause the other person to overcompensate by avoiding your questions. Don't push so hard that you scare someone away with your intensity. Taking a kinder and gentler approach might actually lead to the closer connection you seek."
libra,2014-03-28,"Pay attention to every word that is said today, even in a casual conversation, for there may be more at stake than is apparent at first. A simple discussion about the weather could reveal a crucial piece of information. Keep in mind that if you receive a significant message now, you're not obligated to respond right away. Take the time to consider all your options before deciding what to do next."
scorpio,2014-03-28,"Your tone may be more intense than you think as interactive Mercury activates passionate Pluto today. However, you're not interested in establishing common ground; you know what's right and are willing to fight for it. Unfortunately, you could lose your advantage if you believe that your perspective is the only valid one. State your case without attempting to change anyone's mind. Agreeing to disagree is healthier now than drawing battle lines that cannot be erased."
sagittarius,2014-03-28,"Instead of trying to persuade others to conform to your agenda today, attack scheduling problems the other way around. You may think it's nearly impossible to change your calendar, but ultimately a simple modification could free up enough time to make your entire day flow smoother. Going out of your way to be flexible now might reward you with a golden opportunity that you otherwise would miss."
capricorn,2014-03-28,"Your words pack quite a punch today and you could come across as cold and calculating, even if you believe that you are acting out of kindness. You might not even be aware of how much power you wield as mental Mercury supports intense Pluto in your ambitious sign. Toning down your delivery may be enough to soften your impact. Don't wait until it's too late; practicing a little conscious compassion can go a long way to creating harmonious relationships."
aquarius,2014-03-28,"It might feel like everything is taking longer than it should today and the faster you try to complete a project, the more there is to do. Don't work yourself up into a nervous state, for your current deadlines are likely more flexible than you think. Before getting bent out of shape, explain your situation to those involved. Coming up with a  practical game plan removes some of the pressure. Luckily, you can nip the problem in the bud by maintaining an open dialogue right from the start."
pisces,2014-03-28,"Your emotions are very close to the surface today, making you more vulnerable in your own skin. You might employ uncharacteristic stoicism as a tactic now, denying your sensitivity and sidestepping the crucial issues. However, another strategy is to show up as you are and share your irrational side with the world. Once you realize that you don't need to hide your feelings any longer, your inner strength will shine through for all to see."
aries,2014-03-29,You wake up and are out the door today before you even know your exact destination. But later on you may feel the need to pull back and reassess your direction. You intuitively know that something isn't quite right and you are correct to trust your instincts now. It's okay to socially retreat until you are ready for more involvement. Don't make a big deal about your change of heart; just let everyone know your current uncertainty won't last long and you'll be back to your old self before they even know it.
taurus,2014-03-29,"Paradoxically, you may be acting in a confident manner today while being hesitant at the same time. Your key planet Venus is under tense pressure from austere Saturn, and you might temporarily feel quite alone, even undeserving of love. Thankfully, Venus also forms a sweet trine to energetic Mars, empowering you to overcome your self-doubt. Switching your focus to others and spending some time with your friends ultimately helps you feel better about yourself."
gemini,2014-03-29,"An uncomfortable feeling may be gnawing away at the edge of your awareness today and you cannot shake it off. Although you're often quite lighthearted, relationship dynamics might not seem in sync now. You don't feel as if you fit in the way you usually do, and being alienated on your home turf isn't fun. It seems like the problem is external, but closer analysis could reveal that the emotional discord is connected to your fears. A change in your attitude can improve the chemistry quicker than you think."
cancer,2014-03-29,"You might want someone's shoulder to lean on today, but you may not be completely satisfied with the support you receive. There's no need to put on a smiley face if you're not feeling it. However, initiating an inner dialogue with your own subconscious can help to uncover the source of your loneliness. Establishing temporary boundaries around your heart protects you from being hurt, but withdrawing emotionally could be isolating. Take care of your needs without shutting down your heart in the name of fear."
leo,2014-03-29,"The dynamics of a partnership seem so good and feel so bad all at the very same time. Circumstances appear to be going your way at first, but things might not end up according to your plan. You feel as if you don't want to be here today, but here you are, nonetheless. The good news is you are fully responsible for creating pleasure in your life. Whatever you do, don't give up on making positive change. You may be pleasantly surprised with how quickly things turn around in just a few short days."
virgo,2014-03-29,"Current responsibilities may create complications today because you can't spend much time with those you love. Others might be getting the wrong idea as they feel a distance between you, but you're not really trying to push them away. Nevertheless, they will likely react negatively as if you are shutting them out. Letting people know about your time constraints in advance keeps the expectations to a minimum."
libra,2014-03-29,"You're well-known for your ambivalence, which can make your life more difficult than necessary. Although magnetic Venus is visiting your 5th House of Love and Money, she travels through some tricky territory today. You might even want to run and hide instead of facing the music. However, making a decision can't be forced. Thankfully, your willingness to be patient ultimately brings the satisfaction you seek."
scorpio,2014-03-29,"You are entering into a period of transformation, but first there is this eye of a needle for you to squeeze through. Unfortunately, it's not large enough for you to take all your emotional baggage with you. Although it might not feel good to leave some of your attachments behind, lightening your load puts your most intimate relationships on more solid ground. Although this is a sobering time, keep in mind it's preparing you for something wonderful just around the corner."
sagittarius,2014-03-29,"Today's recipe entails mixing two tablespoons of unbridled optimism, a heaping tablespoon of caution and a tiny dash of unpleasant memories. Shake it all up until you are really unsure of which way to go. Then, spend some time pondering whether or not a current relationship is really worth the sacrifices you are making now. Even if you're confused, your romantic life will emerge stronger in just a day or two if you're willing to face the truth."
capricorn,2014-03-29,You take your commitment to love quite seriously today and want to share your perspective with anyone who will listen. But the reflective Moon in your busy 3rd House of Communication can create logistical cross-currents as everyone distracts you from your agenda. Don't change directions now; just temporarily operate on blind faith. Your unwavering devotion should bring you closer to your goals sooner than you expect.
aquarius,2014-03-29,"Relationships may feel strained today because it seems unlikely that you can find the peace and quiet that you seek. Perhaps money issues have crept back into your life and place a negative spin on your personal interactions. Unfortunately, there might not be a quick and easy way out of your current dilemma. Instead of running away, face the situation with confidence. Learning to trust your instincts takes practice, but there's no better time to start than now."
pisces,2014-03-29,"Figuring out the best course of action is tricky and you may need to proceed before you make a decision. Naturally, moving forward before you are ready is neither fun nor easy, yet it can be a life-altering experience. Ironically, Saturn creates enough resistance to act like a catalyst, temporarily pulling you into uncharted emotional depths. Luckily, you have nothing to fear and everything to gain on this magical journey."
aries,2014-03-30,"It's pointless to use logic to talk yourself out of taking a risk, since today's impulsive Aries New Moon is all about you. If you experienced a false start recently, now is the perfect time to try again. Success could be yours if you are persistent and keep the faith. Don't be afraid to show up with your best intentions and a willingness to work harder than anyone else. This is your moment to shine."
taurus,2014-03-30,"Your vivid dreams may have given you quite a restless night of sleep last night. Fortunately, you can refocus your attention by simply jumping into your busy day with a positive attitude. Today's New Moon in your 12th House of Imagination stirs up unconscious fears, but it's easy to overcome the resistance once you confront it. The busier you are now in the outer world, the less likely you are to get lost in your doubts."
gemini,2014-03-30,"Volunteering for a worthwhile organization or a political cause might sound like a good idea with the Aries New Moon in your 11th House of Groups. You could be looking for something constructive to do, but you're not going to be happy unless your distraction also has a positive social impact. Although mingling with others is usually a source of joy, choose an activity where you can see the results of your contribution right away. Take pride in your efforts to make the world a better place."
cancer,2014-03-30,"Establishing ambitious goals isn't enough; you must be ready to put your good intentions to work today by making your move. It would be a shame to waste this powerful moment of initiation without taking decisive action since the enterprising Aries New Moon falls in your 10th House of Career. Don't worry about what you accomplish or how far along the path you actually travel now. Remember, the first step is the most important one."
leo,2014-03-30,"You can manage a complex scenario today, even if you don't consciously know the best way to deal with it. You may have already struggled with a similar issue more than once, but today's Aries New Moon in your 9th House of Big Ideas reveals a radical solution that wasn't obvious before. Actually, there's no way to predict if your actions will have the desired effect. Take a chance and see where it goes. There's no rational reason to wait any longer to find out; you only live once."
virgo,2014-03-30,"Today's events may initiate a journey of questioning where the deeper you delve, the less you know. The current lesson is that real wisdom only arrives after you stop obsessing about your search. The transition point that contains the mysteries of birth, death and the cosmos occurs when one cycle ends and the next one hasn't yet started. The New Moon in your 8th House of Regeneration is a not-so-gentle reminder that you don't have all the answers. Nevertheless, after conferring with others, you still need to trust the process and move on."
libra,2014-03-30,"It may be time to heat up the dynamics of a current relationship or to fan the flames of a new one now that the fiery Aries New Moon emphasizes your 7th House of Partners. This Sun-Moon conjunction joins erratic Uranus, prompting you to shift directions quickly, without apparent forethought. However, if you don't honor your need for independence, others might pick up on your suppressed energy today and act impulsively to shake things up. Take proactive measures; it's better to express your feelings than have someone else do it for you."
scorpio,2014-03-30,"The day has finally arrived for you to make long-overdue changes to your daily routine, but your actions don't have to be overly dramatic to create a positive impact. The enterprising Aries New Moon activates your 6th House of Details, suggesting that starting small is the smartest strategy. Anything that adds to your efficiency is helpful. But don't wait until tomorrow; you need to do something right now to take advantage of this magical moment."
sagittarius,2014-03-30,"Your ongoing struggle is about balancing work and play, yet the Aries New Moon in your 5th House of Fun and Games currently emphasizes the lighter side of life. It's nearly impossible to be overly serious now, even if you have many obligations to fulfill. But don't sweat it if you leave a task unfinished today. Obviously, it's still wise to acknowledge your previous commitments or life will quickly get complicated. Be responsible, even if you feel like a kid at heart."
capricorn,2014-03-30,"You would like to go on record with a straightforward statement about your feelings today. However, the Aries New Moon triggers your 4th House of Emotional Security, so it might be better to share your feelings in the company of someone you trust. You want others to understand you, yet it's more appropriate to only disclose this kind of information with the closest of friends and family. There's no reason to panic now, so wait until you find the right person, place and time before spilling your darkest secrets."
aquarius,2014-03-30,"Everything you say sounds more important now with the assertive Aries New Moon zapping your 3rd House of Communication. Fortunately, you're able to establish the tone for the changes ahead by writing about your goals, informing others about your perspective and even inspiring your friends and associates with your progressive ideas. Don't wait for someone else to take charge; state what's on your mind and then be ready to put your words into action. He who hesitates is lost."
pisces,2014-03-30,"Utilizing the powerful energy of the Aries New Moon to concentrate on your finances is a wise move today since this lunation lands in your 2nd House of Money. However, you could make a spontaneous decision that doesn't ultimately serve you well. Instead of rushing to turn things upside down, take your time before initiating any significant changes. Working toward long-term stability is a better strategy than attempting to fix everything all at once."
aries,2014-03-31,"Striking up the band and leading a parade might be your idea of fun today, because you want to get people up and moving with you. But the Aries Moon opposes combative Mars in your 7th House of Others, indicating the need to soften your message. Although music can raise the vibration, it's more effective to lower your volume so your friends don't have to cover their ears and miss out on what you are saying. Remember, not everyone is feeling as playful as you are now, so don't take it personally if they don't want to join in your game."
taurus,2014-03-31,"You are not happy if a coworker is on your case, but defending yourself is a common reaction with your obstinate nature. Unfortunately, you may not be all that comfortable handling this awkward situation today. It's easier to hide your anger than to confront the origin of the problem. Keep in mind that this emotional retreat is not a cowardly act. Your self-restraint is wise now; otherwise you might lose control and create additional damage instead of leaving well enough alone. It takes real courage to walk away."
gemini,2014-03-31,"You need to watch the way you interact with people today or your current intensity may appear overly aggressive to others. You might even think that you are being extremely logical, only to have someone tell you that your ideas are too outrageous for them to follow. Instead of ranting about all the details, speak softer and say less. You really don't have to use that many words now to get your point across if you choose the right ones. There's no need to do a sales job when you have authenticity on your side."
cancer,2014-03-31,"You could surprise someone with your ability to defend your choices today. You may be willing to listen to the feedback you receive, but once you've heard what someone else has to offer, your reaction is strong and swift. Although you are uniquely sensitive of the needs of others, be careful about diluting the strength of your argument by attempting to placate everyone's concerns. People will be suitable impressed when they see you stand up for your beliefs."
leo,2014-03-31,"Putting your best ideas on the table for all to see is not an alien concept to you. However, there is so much expressive energy floating around today that you may not know when to stop your self-promotion. Your confidence motivates you to be so assertive that you might offend even your strongest allies. It's much easier to gain support once you remember that you don't have to shout just to get your message across. A laid-back approach will take you further now than a pushy one."
virgo,2014-03-31,"It seems like there's too much drama in your life now, triggering a turning point in your relationships. Someone's negativity boils over and then everything goes silent. But don't mistake less noise for less intensity; it could be just the opposite. There's no reason to feel so much anger that you say things you don't really mean. Withdraw your energy until you have regained your strength and composure. Stepping back to create a bit of space gives everyone a chance to cool off."
libra,2014-03-31,"You're a natural people-pleaser and can be preoccupied with making everyone else happy. But the Sun and Moon are dancing with wild Uranus in your 7th House of Partners now, prompting you to  blurt out what you want without thinking about the impact of your words. Don't let anyone stand between you and your goals; setting well-defined boundaries ensures healthier relationships in the future. Taking a risk and revealing your needs can create the breakthrough that you've wanted all along."
scorpio,2014-03-31,"You're able to start new tasks at work today without becoming overly obsessed with the details or other people's expectations. Unfortunately, follow-through becomes a problem if you don't keep up your initial momentum. Once you slow down you could lose track of your direction, so ask your friends and associates to either lend a helping hand or simply get out of your way. You may be surprised at how much you accomplish if you're willing to focus on the big picture."
sagittarius,2014-03-31,"You might be feeling a sense of urgency today, but don't expect others to share your concerns. Although your friends know that you can wax philosophic with the best of them, they're not very patient as you enthusiastically ramble on about something that may be significant only to you. Your ideas are flowing fast and furious now, making it tricky to tell which ones are worth pursuing. Don't become too attached to any one thought until you see how it stands up to the test of time."
capricorn,2014-03-31,"You feel emboldened to pull rank at work today, but you could easily overdo it. The idea of demonstrating your authority can be so enticing now that you may lose sight of your original intent to get ahead. Nevertheless, success doesn't stem from maintaining control; manifesting your dreams is dependent on innovation and collaboration, and not status. Remember, the whole is greater than the sum of its individual parts."
aquarius,2014-03-31,"The power of your positive thoughts motivates others, but your enthusiasm could be off the charts today. However, blind optimism isn't of much use at all. If someone thinks you can't discern fact from fiction, there's a good chance that he or she will lose faith in your entire message. You can muster support for your plan by being as realistic as possible now. Although everyone wants to hear good news, it's more important for you to be completely honest. The truth will set you free."
pisces,2014-03-31,"Creating new strategies to increase your income should be top priority today with the Sun, Moon and brilliant Uranus moving through your 2nd House of Self-Worth. You have plenty of enterprising ideas about how to generate wealth, but are not sure that any of them will work. Asking for a second opinion from someone you trust is a smart move now. A bit of unconventional wisdom may be all you need to get the ball rolling."
aries,2014-04-01,"Although you might not be able to concentrate for long today, you will get by if you remember to be practical every time you need to make a choice. You have the power to turn molehills into mountains now or to believe a pretty average idea is the most amazing thing ever. Don't get fooled by illusions of grandiose success; keep your feet on the ground and make sure to meet all of your obligations before you spend your time planning world domination."
taurus,2014-04-01,"You may be stretched ridiculously thin today, especially if you promised too much in order to please someone special. Naturally, you don't want to let anyone down, but you must deal with the consequences of your overinflated expectations -- and the sooner you do, the better. Luckily, the Moon in your sign works in your favor now, facilitating communication and enabling you to focus on the tasks at hand. Don't be a quitter; determination and persistence is the key to your success."
gemini,2014-04-01,"Friends or colleagues may bring you good news or an exciting opportunity today. Nevertheless, you should be exceptionally cautious, even if you feel like your lucky star is following you around. Thankfully, the potential is excellent for something you start now, but it's easy to exaggerate the value of the potential rewards. Remember, there's not much to fear except your current tendency to gloss over important details. Whether you like it or not, patience and due diligence are your friends."
cancer,2014-04-01,"Disappointment may set in quickly if you believe your positive attitude will be enough to get you through the day. Obviously, self-confidence is much more productive than self-doubt, but if you are too sure of yourself today, you might forego the very preparations that could make you successful. Don't assume that everything will just turn out for the best unless you're ready to do some heavy lifting along the way. Success is only one part inspiration; the rest requires dedication and perspiration."
leo,2014-04-01,"You're unstoppable today, especially if everything goes according to your plan early in the day. But you're courting trouble if you believe that your life will simply continue to improve on its own. Although maintaining your regular routine is one way to strengthen the foundation of your life, it's not emotionally fulfilling. Enjoy the company of others now, instead of spending every moment strategizing on how best to climb the ladder of success. You can enrich your life in intangible ways by simply being with the ones you love."
virgo,2014-04-01,"You're likely to enjoy a busy day that is chock full of fun distractions, chatty friends and fascinating ideas. However, the good times could get out of hand and you might wish that there wasn't so much noise in your environment. Nevertheless, you may not be able to change the magnitude of events now. Instead of trying to limit your activities, enjoy the sense of spontaneity while it lasts. Make the most of the moment by flowing with the energy until it settles back down."
libra,2014-04-01,"You could sacrifice quality for quantity today, so it's crucial to remember that more of something isn't necessarily better. Although it's tempting, you might not need a second helping of dessert or another drink. Developing one fantastic idea is more useful now than being distracted by lots of mediocre ones. Overindulging can lead to non-productivity and even unpleasant consequences. Paradoxically, fulfilling your most basic needs enables you to stay on a healthy track. One brilliant inspiration is all you need to create a masterpiece."
scorpio,2014-04-01,"You might place too many unrealistic expectations on your boss or coworkers today. Even if you receive recognition for your accomplishments, it's not wise to think that this trend will continue unabated. Instead of trying to please everyone by taking on more work than you can possibly handle, setting boundaries now enables you to be more effective. Your smartest strategy is to demonstrate excellence at one or two things rather than mediocrity at many. The satisfaction of a job well done may be your most satisfying reward."
sagittarius,2014-04-01,"Nearly everything seems to be coming up roses today, yet you can be misled by your own enthusiasm. Jovial Jupiter squares the glorious Sun, shining in your 5th House of Fun and Games, empowering you to turn both sides of the street into the sunny side. However, making time to explore the shadows is not the same thing as being a Negative Nelly; it's smart to take a realistic approach. Acknowledging the truth now can prevent unseen problems down the road."
capricorn,2014-04-01,"Keeping your thoughts to yourself is challenging today because the idea of sharing your wisdom makes you smile. However, other people might not want to see the whole picture now. They are lost in their bubbles of fantasy, believing that everything will somehow sort itself out just in time. Nevertheless, your practical nature enables you to assess the situation in an objective manner. Wait until the afternoon to tell your story, for your words gain power throughout the day. However, keep your expectations to a minimum; you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink."
aquarius,2014-04-01,"You may feel uneasy today if everything appears to be flowing along smoothly because you don't fully trust your current optimism. You're worried that you might be missing a significant piece of the puzzle -- and this is actually a real possibility. Practicing a little self-restraint early in the day could bring a more solid boost of confidence later -- one you can truly rely on. Remember, even if you want to race to the finish line now, managing your progress assures sustainable stability."
pisces,2014-04-01,"Go out and treat yourself to something special today. Although you may be tempted to spend more than you should in the name of pleasure, the price of your purchase is not as important now as what you acquire. Remember, this isn't about making an astute investment or a lucrative deal. It's simply time to honor your inner child with a fun toy or a beautiful gift. Fortunately, a little self-indulgence doesn't have to break the bank if you choose wisely."
aries,2014-04-02,"You could make the people in your life somewhat crazy because you're not interested in fulfilling their expectations. But today's Sun-Uranus conjunction in your sign demands that you act from your own heart. Don't suppress your feelings; if you do, you might regret it sooner than you think. Your job now is to lead by example instead of doing what anyone else thinks you should. Start your own personal revolution by showing the world who you really are."
taurus,2014-04-02,"A situation that seems to be beyond your control could push you into a corner today. If you feel emotionally threatened you might strike out at someone only to later wish you kept your extreme reactions to yourself. Your deepest secrets become fair game for discussion now, so you may as well disclose the truth before you have to do it under duress. Instead of attempting to maintain any semblance of control, use this as an opportunity to clear the air. Taking preemptive action is smarter than waiting and responding after the fact."
gemini,2014-04-02,"An apparently mellow meeting or social event can quickly grow out of hand as too many conflicting emotions agitate the group. Everyone seems to have a different set of needs and tries to steer the situation accordingly. If no one is able to rise above the noise and restore calm, it may be wise to leave the fray for a while. A temporary break might be enough to allow the chaotic energy to settle back down to a manageable level. Put this time to better use by writing down your unconventional ideas to share with everyone later on."
cancer,2014-04-02,"An unstable situation at work might actually be just what you need to come out on top. Someone who was supposed to be running the show may fall short of living up to his or her responsibilities, leaving you with an unexpected opportunity to fill the slot. You probably have more to offer than you realize; don't wait any longer to step up to the plate and show what you can do. Act now and deal with the fallout later."
leo,2014-04-02,"You might be reconsidering your travel plans today -- not because something is wrong with your itinerary, but because you simply don't want to be too tied down to a set schedule. Attending a lecture, seminar or any kind of event that allows you to expand your mind into new areas of study might be your answer. Grab any chance to widen your horizons now, even if it's outside your normal areas of interest. Be fearless and explore new worlds."
virgo,2014-04-02,"A spiritual awakening can come in a variety of guises. You may be touched in ways that you cannot possibly anticipate today as buried feelings or new realizations explode into awareness. There's no specific practice to make this kind of breakthrough happen on schedule. It's like trying to predict exactly when and where lightning will strike. Nevertheless, don't try to run away from it when it does, for it's only dangerous if you close your mind and heart. There's nothing to fear if you have faith in the inherent wisdom of the universe."
libra,2014-04-02,"Your world may seem more chaotic than you wish, but the instability also brings great potential for making necessary changes. Unfortunately, your insecurities might be stirred if people act erratically, but their radical behavior could be just what you need to shock you out of your complacency. If someone comes to you today with a totally outrageous idea, don't dismiss it until you truly consider its merits. Recognize genius before it's too late."
scorpio,2014-04-02,"Skipping some of your regular routine is wise today because shaking things up might be the best thing you can do. Paradoxically, the more rigid you remain, the more difficult it is to stay on track. Even if you try to maintain consistency, one interruption after another may finally force you to set your schedule aside. However, there's no need to work yourself into a state of frustration. Accepting the instability of the day and responding with flexibility frees you to reinvent yourself without the restraint of old habits."
sagittarius,2014-04-02,"Even if you're a natural-born adventurer, pushing into new territory now encourages you to take creative risks you might not have previously considered. Your enthusiasm is high and you are suddenly inspired to try doing things differently than ever before. Others are watching you to see what you are going to do next. Surprise them with your unorthodox behavior today as you reach for the stars. If you act like the innovator you imagine yourself to be, you can be an inspiration to everyone else, too."
capricorn,2014-04-02,"Your spirits may be lifted by good news today, or perhaps you are just ready to fly no matter what is happening in your life. Normally, you would advance your next project methodically one step at a time. Although you typically like to keep your feet on solid ground, your foundation might feel a bit unstable these days. Open your mind and widen your horizons. Instead of looking back for security, let go of the past and take a leap of faith into the future."
aquarius,2014-04-02,"Even if time already seems to be moving fast, the pace of your life is accelerating again as the Sun catches up with your key planet Uranus. You may be thinking about a quick escape, but it's not about running away from the hard work. To the contrary, you're probably eager to jump into a project now, but it's challenging because you're distracted by so much noise in your immediate environment. Embrace the unknown instead of avoiding it. This quantum leap could bring the positive changes you seek."
pisces,2014-04-02,"Your finances may be impacted today in one of two ways. You could face an unexpected expenditure that puts you into a precarious position. Or, you might actually receive a windfall as money comes to you from out of the blue. Either way, react with caution; don't assume that this sudden change of fortune -- for better or for worse -- will last. It's not helpful to panic or to spend impulsively. Conserve your money and your energy for a rainy day."
aries,2014-04-03,"You may employ an all-or-nothing approach to accomplish your goals today, but could inadvertently hurt someone's feelings along the way without even knowing it. You are so determined to manifest your dreams now that you might take things too far. Ultimately, you progress further if you can empathize with the perspective of others, too. Slow down to fully experience the present moment instead of living for the imagined success of the future."
taurus,2014-04-03,"You want others to adopt your point of view today, even if you aren't willing to defend your position. Either way, it isn't that simple since there might be an emotional trap lurking just out of sight. Expressing what's on your mind is advised, but the passionate reaction you receive in return can be way more intense than you bargained for. Thankfully, there's no reason to be in a hurry to share all of your ideas at once. Don't rush; a measured approach has a more enduring impact with less collateral damage."
gemini,2014-04-03,"Although you certainly don't need any additional stress in your life, trying to avoid drama only seems to draw it closer now. You might think that filling your social calendar will distract you enough to make the tense atmosphere easier to handle. However, this kind of strategy could backfire by complicating matters further. It's smarter to confront an uncomfortable issue head on today than trying to sidestep it. Face the music and dance."
cancer,2014-04-03,"Relationships could be the source of discomfort now as you feel a growing pressure to choose between your home and your career. However, any lack of support you experience forces you to go through your own metamorphosis, which could be a positive process in the long run. Don't go overboard in your attempt to restore balance. Nevertheless, releasing old assumptions is required before you can begin to develop healthier ways to express what's in your heart. To thine own self be true."
leo,2014-04-03,"Someone may see your behavior as ruthless now, but you're running on adrenaline and don't have the time to stop and think about how your actions impact those around you. Still, a conflict at work could tempt you to manipulate others if you believe it's in the best interest of all involved. Unfortunately, you might be so self-righteous today that you fail to include anyone else's position in your plans. Loosen up; no matter what you're doing, it's not as important as it seems."
virgo,2014-04-03,"You are often content to work quietly in supportive roles, but you could grow frustrated now if you don't receive the recognition you deserve. Fortunately, you're still able to separate your current disappointments from your job performance, enabling you to meet your professional obligations without revealing your deepest feelings. However, hiding your vulnerability extracts a cost. It's smarter to share your concerns without placing blame on anyone. Expressing your needs allows others to connect with you in a more genuine manner."
libra,2014-04-03,"You might expect to receive the support you need today, but it could be withdrawn at the very last minute. Change is in the air and soon you won't be able to go back to where you were. But even if you can't solve the entire problem now, you're off to a fabulous start. Don't take no for an answer; if you do run into resistance, simply retreat, revamp your plan as needed and then try again when the time feels right."
scorpio,2014-04-03,"There may be no resolution in sight to a dilemma that just won't go away. Perhaps you think you just need to create some fireworks to clear the air once and for all. However, you're probably not all that eager for change now. Although the clash between your beliefs and what you must do can incite you to stubbornly take a stand today, you are wiser to proceed slowly and let the stress resolve on its own."
sagittarius,2014-04-03,"You feel exceedingly clever today, but you still can't just charm your way past the current obstacles. Be careful, something has to give if you push people too hard. A clash of values may be expressed through a personal drama, but delays and setbacks are symptoms of a deeper issue that also needs attention. Handle any resistance that surfaces now, for avoidance only makes matters worse. Finding that sweet spot between too much and not enough isn't simple, but it worked for Goldilocks and it can work for you."
capricorn,2014-04-03,"You don't need any surprises now, but the new emotional landscape indicates that you could be thrown for a loop anyhow if you discover that someone has been secretly working against you. Nevertheless, the best defense is an intelligent offense, so don't just wait for something bad to happen. Ultimately, striking up a conversation about a delicate subject is much more productive than reacting to a crisis after the fact. Shining the light into the shadows is the quickest way to illuminate the truth."
aquarius,2014-04-03,"You may actually believe you can remain emotionally detached from a drama in your immediate environment, but your feelings are so connected with everything today that it's impossible to escape. In fact, it's frustrating if all your hard work still doesn't produce the income that you want, leaving you shorter on funds than you expected. Canceling some of your travel plans might be enough to help you regain your lost balance. If you slow down your spending you'll have a better chance of reaching your goals faster."
pisces,2014-04-03,"You might think you're being manipulated by external events now. However, your peers may be doing the sensible thing by just attempting to protect themselves from the tides of economic change. Paradoxically, tightening the reins isn't your best strategy today since you can't control all the variables, no matter how hard you try. Thankfully, others are willing to share the responsibility if you loosen your grip and let them work with you instead of against you."
aries,2014-04-04,"You may be in a state of low-level panic today because you believe that you're running out of time. Even if you have special plans for the weekend, restrict your activities so you have enough time to finish your chores. It's not easy to make the best choices now unless you take a few steps back from the social whirlwind, set your priorities and then follow through in a sensible manner. If you find yourself getting swept up in the moment, reconnecting with your center might be enough to bring you back down to Earth."
taurus,2014-04-04,"Fitting everything into your hectic schedule is tricky now because your day is already hopping before you even jump out of bed. But you don't want to cut one activity short just to make time for another because you hope to get the most out of each experience. However, you're also tempted to squeeze something else in just because it sounds like fun. Remember, doing more today is not necessarily in your best interest; quality wins over quantity nearly every time."
gemini,2014-04-04,"Sticking to your schedule is such a struggle today that you might believe it's not worth even trying. But don't think that having fewer plans means that you will be able to relax. Life will be easier if you accept the fact that you must respond to changing circumstances throughout the day. Keep in mind that your flexibility is currently your greatest asset. Nevertheless, don't let your eagerness to adapt stop you from digging deeper to uncover the origins of your current desires."
cancer,2014-04-04,"You're bouncing all over the emotional map today and might not be able to moderate your feelings. It's easier to manage your desires by keeping them to yourself, and luckily, others can't see past your smokescreen of complacency. Once you share what's on your mind, everything grows more complicated, so be careful about what you say in the first place. Wait until tomorrow when the evocative Moon is back in your sign before revealing your vulnerable side."
leo,2014-04-04,"You may have extremely high standards today, creating unrealistic expectations that are difficult to meet. You can logically understand the reasons behind the behavior of your friends now, but even your objective rationalization doesn't diminish your disappointment. Instead of judging those you love, cut them some slack for being who they are rather than who you want them to be. Open your heart and simply be the friend you want."
virgo,2014-04-04,"You have high hopes today but things just might not unfold as planned, demonstrating early on that nothing is as certain as it seems. You could end up very frustrated if you attempt to force your agenda onto the changing landscape. Instead, it's a smarter idea to practice relinquishing control now. Surprisingly, not only will you enjoy yourself, you'll also accomplish more than you think."
libra,2014-04-04,"Although you may choose to take a break from riding the rollercoaster today, your emotions continue to rise and fall, giving you a queasy feeling in the pit of your stomach. You have grown tired of the thrills and chills, yet there doesn't seem to be much you can do about it. Don't worry; the key is to enjoy what you encounter along the way without being overly concerned about what you might find around the next bend. Be here now."
scorpio,2014-04-04,"Your feelings are raw and deep today, yet you are able to navigate through difficult spaces quite efficiently. You're processing dark feelings quite rapidly now, but not because you wish to avoid them. In fact, it's just the opposite; you can benefit from your willingness to jump into the fire, experience the intensity of the heat and then let go as the metamorphosis occurs."
sagittarius,2014-04-04,"Although you might be sidetracked today by someone else's drama, you won't be able to stay serious for too long. You're quick to employ your advanced skills of evasive active, especially if they help you to avoid an awkward issue. But applying a bit of wit and charm at the right time can be the perfect antidote for an intense situation that could use some levity to counteract the gravity."
capricorn,2014-04-04,"Playing a heavy-handed role today might not be the best strategy to reach your goals, especially if your attempts fall short of successfully pulling it off. Luckily, you won't waste too much time being self-critical because you can see the silver linings in every dark cloud now. There's no need to rush in the pursuit of your dreams. The sky will clear on its own."
aquarius,2014-04-04,"Your feelings are transforming too fast to make any long-term decisions now. Although your overall values are constant, your moods continue to shift as you learn more about those close to you. Even if you're afraid of losing control in a relationship, your fear is likely worse than any possible outcome. Focusing on the best-case scenario now actually helps it to manifest. Your imagination clears the path for reality to follow."
pisces,2014-04-04,"Losing your faith is nearly impossible today, even if you bump up against difficult emotions. An old issue might resurface, prompting you to feel insecure about your family or social relationships. But once you accept that the present circumstances are quite different from your past, it's much easier for you to see the sweet potential rather than doom and gloom. Set positive intentions, but don't expect instant miracles."
aries,2014-04-05,"Consider the wide variety of alternatives in front of you today, rather than stubbornly fixating on any one idea. However, focusing on your future may not be as straightforward as you wish. Although you can explore new perspectives without losing track of your original destination, you might still be overwhelmed with all your choices. Keeping your channels of communication open increases your chances of reaching your goals. Help is readily available if you simply ask for it."
taurus,2014-04-05,"An unresolved financial issue may capture your attention today. Even if the problem is something you prefer to avoid, it's better to face the music sooner than later. However, when all is said and done, you still could have a few loose ends to tie up. Unfortunately, you might need to simply accept that you're only human and move on. Don't let current circumstances drain your energy or your positive attitude. You need to be operating at your best for whatever the future holds."
gemini,2014-04-05,"Quieting your mind is an impossible task now because your thoughts continue to bounce around, prompting you to change your mind on a whim. However, the Moon's current visit to airy Gemini brings a sharp edge of focus to your perceptions. Take whatever time you need to write down your best ideas, but wait a day or two before making any final decisions. Choosing the right moment to act is an art in itself."
cancer,2014-04-05,"People trust you more these days if you give them an opportunity to share their feelings with you. Unfortunately, everyone is so busy now that it's nearly impossible to connect with them. Thankfully, you know when to walk away from all the noise. Your best bet today might be to find a quiet spot where you can talk privately with a friend. All is well when you're taking care of those you love."
leo,2014-04-05,"Working with others can be quite a challenge now, especially if a fearful person's resistance is slowing down the entire process. Hold tightly to your objectivity; losing patience isn't in your best interest today. Show your strength by adapting to the circumstances instead of digging in your heels. Your generosity of spirit overcomes nearly any obstacle that stands in your way."
virgo,2014-04-05,"Your current plans don't make as much sense now that everyone is running around in different directions, making it hard for you to stick to your agenda. Letting go of your expectations brings welcome relief today, especially if you maintain a sense of humor. Laughing releases tensions, enabling you to gracefully move through an uncomfortable situation. Keep an open mind and you might even learn a valuable lesson that you can apply later on."
libra,2014-04-05,"Cramming a lot of activity into one day doesn't necessarily mean that you are being productive. You might feel as if you're running around in circles today on a quest for something to challenge you. But you may grow weary of searching for the missing puzzle piece that makes sense of everything else. However, the answer to your malaise can't be found externally. Time spent in contemplation or meditation offers more rewards now than wasting energy on pursuing worldly distractions."
scorpio,2014-04-05,"Delivering on your promises usually feels gratifying, but today it can also present a unique set of problems. Your feelings shift as do the prevailing winds of change, and you would be wise to modify your plans accordingly. If you run into someone who has recently decided to take a different course or wants to alter an agreement with you, don't bother fighting it. Just absorb what is said and make the most sensible adjustments as quickly as possible. Cooperation leads to more progress now than competition."
sagittarius,2014-04-05,"Your partner may agree to your plans today, but the energy is too scattered to make much progress. Don't waste time attempting to get others on board; instead, remember that different points of view could be just as valid as yours. There are multiple answers to any question, so consider all your options rather than cleverly trying to find one quick solution to sell to everyone else. The process of collaboration ultimately produces the best results."
capricorn,2014-04-05,The tiniest little detail might be what counts the most today. An apparently insignificant event can complicate your work and delay your progress. Pay meticulous attention to how everything fits together to assure there's no trouble. Balancing your powerful focus with a graceful flexibility grounds you while also freeing you from your current dilemma. Think outside of the box to discover a different route to success.
aquarius,2014-04-05,"A creative project might come to a temporary standstill today because there are so many intriguing possibilities on the horizon. You need to decide if you want to continue on the same path or change your direction. You may be overwhelmed by all the choices, making you second-guess your original plan. Don't be afraid to examine your motives in greater depth to enrich your understanding of the entire process. Instead of losing yourself in endless analysis, let your intuition be your guide."
pisces,2014-04-05,"Managing a dynamic situation at home might look like child's play, but you still take it very seriously. You really don't want to be distracted by any career or community involvement now as you realize how important your family is to you. Communication is a significant key to conflict resolution, yet it's easy to get swept up into someone's passionate argument today. Maintain your objectivity while tuning into the emotions behind the words. Oddly enough, your rational outlook and compassionate heart are an unbeatable combination."
aries,2014-04-06,"Everything seems to be happening so fast now that you don't even have time to think about what you're going to do; you simply do it. You barely complete a conversation or finish a project before something new comes at you from another direction. Fortunately, you are a master at thinking on your feet and reacting quickly. No particular planning is necessary today; you can always make adjustments later on. Give yourself permission to embrace the spontaneity of the moment."
taurus,2014-04-06,"You're resistant to participating in a group event now because you don't want to relinquish your sense of control over your day. Although you might be able to muster up enough energy to slip by unnoticed, others may perceive you as lazy because they don't feel your enthusiasm. However, limiting most of your activity to the non-physical world of emotional fantasy isn't a waste of time since today's dreams can turn into tomorrow's reality."
gemini,2014-04-06,"You may be quite excited about what's ahead but something is simultaneously anchoring you to the past. Ironically, the future might even feel more real than the present moment. Unfortunately, it's probably harder than you think to execute your plans today. Instead of trying to manage all the variables, take a radical approach and just let go of control for a while. Floating on the waves without resistance is more productive now than struggling to maintain your current direction."
cancer,2014-04-06,"You could be feeling stressed today, especially if your friends expect you to be a team player and you want to relax. Even if you spend much of the day at home, it's challenging to take your mind completely off unsettling dynamics at work or in your community. Thankfully, you don't have to resolve the tension immediately. Instead, allow your feelings to ebb and flow with your own emotional tides, putting off significant decisions until the pressure subsides."
leo,2014-04-06,"Expressing your feelings is not as simple as it sounds today. Even if you try to share what's on your mind, language falls short of communicating your experience. Although anger from an old emotional wound may linger, it's hard to stay in a negative place for very long now because of all the possibilities you see waiting on the horizon. Instead of talking about your dilemma, improve your life one positive step at a time. Actions speak louder than words."
virgo,2014-04-06,"Typically, your top priority is putting all your facts in order rather than exploring your feelings about a complex situation. However, you can push through old emotional limitations and into new territory today because you want the most intense experience you can find. Your impulsive behavior might surprise your friends because you usually adopt a more cautious approach. Acknowledge your desires even if you're afraid of being judged. Don't let this special opportunity to create positive change slip through your fingers."
libra,2014-04-06,"Improving relationship dynamics takes some extra effort now because it's difficult to rein in your thoughts and feelings. Nevertheless, it's a smart strategy to try to open the lines of communication anyhow. Be careful; if you are a procrastinator, you may have to contend with someone who has a very different idea of what you should be doing today. Nevertheless, don't worry too much about other people's expectations. Do what you can to keep the energy flowing, but take care of yourself, too, even if it means doing nothing at all."
scorpio,2014-04-06,"You are willing to freely express your feelings today because you're not so worried about receiving a harsh reaction from anyone else. You might even get an adrenaline rush from stepping over the edge of acceptability, if only for the shock value. However, revealing your quirkiness is safer now because you are so focused on whatever work needs to be done. It's easier to get away with being weird when you are also highly efficient."
sagittarius,2014-04-06,"You may appear overly enthusiastic today because you throw yourself wholeheartedly into nearly everything you do. Others have a hard time keeping up with you as you race around fulfilling your current obligations. Ironically, you still might feel as if you're running out of time even though you're on a creative roll now. Remember that other people need to adhere to schedules, even if you're less attached to their concept of linear time. A little sensitivity goes a long way toward establishing harmony."
capricorn,2014-04-06,"Your day could offer the respite you need, though it still may be challenging for you to sit back and fully enjoy it. A hectic day on the home front magnifies your desire for some peace and quiet, but you might be bored by the time you finally get it. Remember, there's no reason to create additional drama where none previously existed. Your attitude can make all the difference in the world; finding your center enables you to grab moments of calm even in the midst of chaos."
aquarius,2014-04-06,"You might experience an intellectual breakthrough today. You could learn something new from a close friend that helps you understand how much others value your contributions now. But rather than resting on your laurels and basking in the warmth of the compliments, you're already eager for the next project. It's admirable to pursue your ambitions so passionately, but first take time to celebrate your previous accomplishments."
pisces,2014-04-06,"The real world may not seem very important now as you entertain your fantasies. Fortunately, your daydreaming might turn into quite a spiritual journey if you are ready to minimize your attachment to material needs. Nevertheless, no matter how this kind of inter-dimensional thinking plays itself out, financial concerns could bring you crashing back down to earth today. Attend to your commitments with the same urgency that you give your dreams so you can return to your creative pursuits as soon as possible."
aries,2014-04-07,"You want to make sure that everyone knows exactly what's on your mind as communicator Mercury marches into your spontaneous sign. But it feels as if your intentions are thwarted over and over again today. Ironically, the more determined you are to speak your piece, the more frustrated you become. Perhaps it's best to take your cues from the current circumstances and keep your thoughts to yourself for now instead of fighting against the tide. Your delivery will be more convincing if you wait a few more days."
taurus,2014-04-07,"You know what you should do today, but may be so entangled in all the details that you don't have a clue where to start. Each time you revise your plan of attack, you bump into another problem that needs to be resolved before you can make any real headway. You might be tempted to throw your hands up in the air and walk away. However, the current dilemma is more like a test than a setback. There's no reason to panic or give up; just keep calm and stay focused on the final destination."
gemini,2014-04-07,"Patience is not usually your strong suit, but there's no way to escape the fact that you must play the waiting game today. However, your desire to find an immediate resolution to a pesky problem only makes matters worse. Concentrate on finding a long-term solution rather than a quick fix, so the resistance will dissipate and things can gradually start to move in your direction. Steady progress is best achieved now one step at a time."
cancer,2014-04-07,"You might instigate a power play today, yet your family and co-workers probably don't even realize what's happening. You have a plan to reach your goals but could go about your business in a rather sneaky manner now. Working toward a specific goal is admirable, but don't get caught up in complicated schemes. Find the courage to tell others the truth about what you're doing and why. You may be pleasantly surprised by the support you receive when you are completely honest."
leo,2014-04-07,"You rarely have trouble letting others know where you stand. However, you may be more secretive now than anyone realizes. You appear to be straightforward when you tell everyone what's on your mind, but your spoken words differ from your desires. Don't be too hard on yourself; you're under no obligation to disclose your emotional needs as long as you're meeting your current obligations. Share your personal story with your associates later on if and when you feel like it. Your heart doesn't have to be an open book for everyone to read."
virgo,2014-04-07,"You want to be more engaged with your coworkers, but your cautious nature prevents you from being too friendly. Nevertheless, you still might find yourself in a social situation now where you need to interact with someone who isn't in your closest circle of friends. Don't be overly critical of anyone today, including yourself; save your judgment for another time. Getting along with others is easier once you accept yourself just as you are. A warm smile might be enough to get the ball rolling."
libra,2014-04-07,"You are comfortable falling back on your role as peacemaker by listening to all the stories being told at work today. Even if you're expected to hold a centrist position that validates each individual person, you aren't as neutral as everyone thinks. Nevertheless, you feel the pressure to keep your opinion quiet now. Although your frustration may increase throughout the day, rest assured the tension will eventually fade, allowing space for a whole new round of negotiations."
scorpio,2014-04-07,"There may be rules at work that seem very rigid, perhaps with good reason, but you want them to change anyhow. You're tempted to unilaterally break out of the old routine, but sudden action on your part today could destabilize the whole system. Instead of expecting everything to shift immediately, keep up a gentle but constant pressure. Although nothing seems to move fast enough for your tastes, your steady force can ultimately bend reality in your favor."
sagittarius,2014-04-07,"Something dramatic happens today that impacts your attitude and empowers you to think outside of the box. Although your thoughts may be unrestrained, an array of complications prevents you from openly sharing them with others. Perhaps your ingenious idea will work, but there's a high cost of upsetting the current stability of your relationships at work. Don't speak too soon; make sure your solution is practical before telling others about it later in the week when the timing is better."
capricorn,2014-04-07,"You may feel a bit like a military leader now, preparing for your next campaign. But warrior Mars harshly opposes the willful Sun tomorrow, already making it tricky to draw the line between assertive action and overt aggression. You could get so worked up about accomplishing a specific task that you temporarily forget that not everyone shares the same goal. Step back and ask what others need before assuming that they want to follow your orders."
aquarius,2014-04-07,"The pace of your life is hectic these days, yet you're enjoying the exciting buzz of energy. However, it's difficult to stick to your daily routine and accomplish your goals for the day. You might be torn between talking about all the amazing things that are happening now and having to perform your same old job in the same old way. You know what's possible, but it seems a step away no matter how quickly you walk. Work smarter instead of harder; you have a better chance of catching up with your intentions next week."
pisces,2014-04-07,"Feeling happy about what you're doing is one thing, but it's something entirely different to communicate your experience to someone else. Although you seem to be making progress, you might not receive the support that you expect today. Confronting others won't help; in fact, it only heightens the tension. Just get along doing the best you can on your own; your friends and associates will be suitably impressed when they see the results of your productivity."
aries,2014-04-08,"Set priorities and start tackling your to-do list early in the day. Although you're eager to work hard, everything could still take longer than you think. You're in a feisty mood today as the Sun opposes your key planet Mars, but it's hard to know where to direct your passion. Relationship dynamics may feel tense now, making it crucial to avoid petty ego disputes. Don't waste your energy trying to win an argument, even if you know you're right. Taking the high road isn't easy but it's the most reliable path to success."
taurus,2014-04-08,"Even if you were planning on kicking back and relaxing today, there's more going on in your immediate environment than you can ignore. Attempting to avoid the action only creates tension now, for you're likely to be pulled in by unplanned circumstances anyhow. It's best to throw in the towel sooner than later, for you just might have fun once you let yourself be swept up in the social whirlwind. Embrace the element of surprise and anything can happen."
gemini,2014-04-08,"You have been operating on overdrive for a while now and you wish you could take some time off before you run out of steam. Although there are signs that you can slow down ahead, you won't be let off the hook just yet. You might be able to amaze others with how much you accomplish, but burning yourself out in the process is surely not worth it. If you're feeling somewhat depleted today, sneak away to recharge your batteries before you jump back into the race."
cancer,2014-04-08,"Someone may be expecting you to do more than you can deliver and you don't like to let anyone down even if you're feeling overcommitted. In fact, you don't want to miss out on any of the action now, so you might say yes before you think about the consequences. Allowing yourself to be talked into any activities that scatter your energy is not a good idea today. Creating healthy boundaries gives others the opportunity to respect your limits. Taking care of yourself is just as important as nurturing everyone else."
leo,2014-04-08,"Your current service to others may be tied to your spiritual aspirations, but spinning lots of wheels at once can also prevent you from attending to your own dreams. Interactions with friends act as a catalyst now, sending you back into your colorful imagination. There is nothing wrong with entertaining your fantasies as long as you don't use them to escape from a conflict in the real world. Nevertheless, avoiding unnecessary drama allows your generous spirit to shine while still leaving time for your inner journey."
virgo,2014-04-08,"You have more time to figure out how to improve your cash flow, yet you still might believe that you have to make a decision right away. If you feel an overwhelming sense of urgency, take several deep breaths and step back from the situation. Hasty actions won't be productive today, so consider all your options before you shift into gear. There's no need to rush now; believe it or not, everything is unfolding according to schedule."
libra,2014-04-08,"Someone's behavior may not be totally transparent now and he or she might even be working against your good intentions. Don't lash out if you discover that a friend isn't being supportive; take what you learn in stride. Making others feel guilty will only waste your time and energy. Be thankful that you know the truth about what's really going on, for what you don't know can hurt you more than you think. Although it's wise to watch your back, giving another person the benefit of the doubt is an exercise of compassion."
scorpio,2014-04-08,"Unexpressed feelings can be complicated to manage if your anger or resentment has nowhere to go. Unfortunately, it could be tough to understand what is motivating you now and how deep your passions run. Don't just jump into an argument today since you may be tricking yourself into believing that a simple solution exists. Move cautiously, for you are so receptive now that your emotions may be projecting from someone else. A current conflict is more easily resolved by doing your inner work than by just fixing something externally in your environment."
sagittarius,2014-04-08,"Remaining practical while diving deeply into your own emotional reservoir can be a challenging task today. You're probably reluctant to set aside unrealistic dreams, even if obligations are keeping you on a short leash. Stay true to your highest ideals by doing the most responsible thing. Be as thorough as possible when it comes to your work for more is going on than meets the eye. There's a fine balance between taking care of business and honoring the whims of your heart."
capricorn,2014-04-08,"Although you are extremely impatient today, honoring your responsible nature minimizes the chances of doing anything foolish. Fortunately, you have a secret reserve of energy, enabling you to finish what you start as long as you don't fly off the edge on an emotional tangent. If you find yourself itching to do something else, just remember that there will be plenty of time later to start a new project. Be consistent and stay on your path without making any sudden changes in direction."
aquarius,2014-04-08,"Trust what you feel in your body now instead of solely relying on your intellect to discover a solution. Nevertheless, you still need to dig beneath the obvious since you won't be satisfied until you know the whole truth. Others may not understand your interest in subjects that seem irrelevant to them, but don't worry about what they think. If it seems significant to you, then take the time to check it out. After all, you're the director of your own movie and the star of your own show."
pisces,2014-04-08,"It's not too late to review your action plan for the days ahead if you stumble upon an important fact you previously missed. Don't waste time arguing with others today; it's more critical to uncover the truth than it is to make your point. Avoid lingering in discouragement, even if you discover something you don't like. This is a wonderful opportunity to refine your strategy and improve your chances for success."
aries,2014-04-09,"You can accomplish a lot today as long as you don't set work aside in order to pursue pleasure. Thankfully, overcoming obstacles is easier now because the Moon is traveling through your 5th House of Self-Expression while she supports the radiant Sun in your sign. However, it's more important to deliver on your promises than it is to find immediate gratification. But don't try to place the blame for your dilemma on external circumstances. Just consider the consequences of your actions and do whatever makes the most sense in the long run."
taurus,2014-04-09,"You can't escape your responsibilities today, yet you're more likely to be concerned with expressing your desires than you are with meeting your current obligations. Your romantic heart may be in direct conflict with your pragmatic head, distracting you from accomplishing your work. Even if you are motivated to follow your feelings now, there's no need to do anything about them. Allow your emotional stress to peak and then subside before swinging into action."
gemini,2014-04-09,"You're in your element if your coworkers turn this into a very busy day because you prefer to stay in motion now. You're in rare form and can show off your wit and charm, flitting from one activity to another. However, irrepressible desires are brewing just beneath the surface, so don't waste your time on trivial matters today. Take this opportunity to deliver a meaningful message. But keep some energy in reserve for when you will need it over the next several days."
cancer,2014-04-09,"You can be so sensitive to other people's moods that it's often tough to take direct action, especially if you're unsure of the reaction you may receive. However, instead of adopting a wait-and-see approach today, you're more likely to respond without thinking to a complicated situation at work. But being wildly impulsive isn't helpful either. Overconfidence leads to recklessness; it's smarter to solve the existing problems now than to create new ones."
leo,2014-04-09,"Your actions might seem transparent today with the demonstrative Leo Moon lighting up your 1st House of Personality. But you're in touch with feelings that haven't fully reached the surface yet, so someone may get the wrong idea about you. Paradoxically, your thoughts carry even more weight now because they are unspoken. Observe how others judge you without saying any more than is necessary. It's better to share what's on your mind after you figure out who you can trust with your secrets."
virgo,2014-04-09,"You try to keep your preferences quiet today because you don't want other people to know your likes and dislikes. You can easily rationalize hiding your desires because you're unwilling to hurt anyone else's feelings. Nevertheless, the dynamics are more complicated than they seem, since remaining silent about your needs further contributes to the awkwardness. Sharing your feelings in a sensitive manner encourages cooperation rather than resistance."
libra,2014-04-09,"You want to demonstrate your appreciation for your coworkers and associates today, but you prefer to do it in an emotionally detached manner. However, your need for objectivity becomes more noticeable once you start sharing your feelings because others are likely to be more responsive than you expect. You may be required to confront your own ambiguity now, especially if someone reacts with great intensity. Even if you are resistant at first to revealing your vulnerability, you'll feel relieved once everything is out in the open."
scorpio,2014-04-09,"You may startle yourself today with the speed of your reaction to an event that seems to be beyond your control. You might say that you're willing to go with the flow, but the emotional Moon is in fixed Leo, making it difficult for you to adapt to the changes. Most surprises should turn out for the best as long as you're willing to step into unknown territory, face the current challenges with a positive attitude and stay open to altering your overall course of action."
sagittarius,2014-04-09,"Meeting your match is momentarily enchanting today as someone with lots of big ideas captures your imagination. However, you might wish that you could escape if the energy gets to be too much, but you won't likely try very hard. No matter what you do now, philosophical conversations seem to follow you around. Fortunately, you can learn something quite valuable from your interactions with others. Keeping your mind open enables you to widen your horizons and cover new ground."
capricorn,2014-04-09,"Nothing is as simple as it appears today; although you want to stick to your agenda, you find it tedious to follow the ins and outs of a complex conversation. Oddly enough, you're feeling restless and you might prefer to jump around from one topic to another. Or, perhaps you just slip off and disappear into your daydreams where no one can find you. The tables are turned now since you're the one who is seeking the fun and resisting the work. Let the good times roll."
aquarius,2014-04-09,"Although you might appear to be open to change, your mind is probably already made up and more facts won't likely alter your thinking today. Unfortunately, this rigidity on your part can amplify your troubles now. You don't gain anything by allowing yourself to be controlled by unexpressed fears. Talking about your current apprehensions with a trusted friend is the most effective way to dissipate negative energy before it creates a more persistent problem."
pisces,2014-04-09,"You would like to impress everyone with your hard work today, but it may be a struggle to walk your talk. Unfortunately, your immediate needs might be in conflict with those around you, making it more complicated to know what to do next. However, there's no reason to set aside your desires just to placate others. Ultimately, you know what will work best for you, so quiet your mind and listen to your own intuition rather than seeking answers from anyone else."
aries,2014-04-10,"You're feeling so confident today that you don't think you should have to play by the established rules of the game. Nevertheless, there is more going on than meets the eye. You could be confused about the dynamics of your current relationship or you might be in love with someone who doesn't return your affection. Even if you're anxious underneath your air of bravado, don't make any sudden changes. Your answers are still on the way."
taurus,2014-04-10,"You might be worried today because you're not as certain about some of the very same things you normally take for granted. You could act as if you know what you're doing but you are less than secure, especially in your role within your family. Thankfully, being in the company of others helps you feel better about yourself. However, don't go overboard by trying to be the center of attention now. Surrounding yourself with those you love reminds you of what's most important."
gemini,2014-04-10,"You may find yourself totally immersed in an intriguing discussion about world politics, great literature or the latest pop culture trends -- only to realize there was a misunderstanding earlier in the conversation. Although it might not be significant in the long run, it can ruffle some feathers in the moment. Slow down and take a more conservative approach until you know that everyone is on the same page. Listen at least as much as you speak today so you don't unintentionally step on anyone's toes."
cancer,2014-04-10,"Sharing your feelings with someone special could be wonderful today, but you should be on the lookout for hidden agendas, nonetheless. It is pleasant enough as long as you stay in the present moment, but as soon as you try to navigate into the future you might inadvertently set a course for conflict. Watch where you step for the next few days and let each situation guide you as you go. Paying careful attention to the clues enables you to steer clear of an unnecessary drama."
leo,2014-04-10,"It helps to give your feelings plenty of room for expression while the Moon is visiting your sign. This is your time to explore a variety of emotional responses to your current circumstances. But don't be overly naive or someone will quickly pull the wool over your eyes. Take responsibility for your own feelings even if you don't yet know where they will lead you. However, there's no need to pretend you're in control, especially since a few surprises could still pop up along the way."
virgo,2014-04-10,"You are naturally a hard worker and you rarely have trouble delivering on your promises. However, it may be okay to let some of your responsibilities fall to the wayside for a while and take some time off today. Visit the outer limits of your imagination by losing yourself in a movie or a book. Step outside of the box in which you normally contain yourself so efficiently and float off into your dreams."
libra,2014-04-10,"You're standing on a slippery slope where it's all too easy to confuse friendship with love. Although relationships are in the spotlight today, they can actually be a source of instability, especially if you depend on the other person to make the first move. Consider what you want and act on your feelings before the winds of fate blow you into dangerous waters. There's little room for ambiguity if you're clear about your intentions right from the start."
scorpio,2014-04-10,"You are being pulled in two directions today. You feel the need to retreat from social obligations for a while so you can just chill out. But simultaneously, an inner voice reminds you of how much fun you have when you're hanging out with the right people. However, you first must push through your own resistance. Happily, you can have the best of both worlds if you pick your playmates carefully. Spending time in the company of those who love you is good for your heart."
sagittarius,2014-04-10,"You should be able to enjoy the fiery Leo Moon today, for it encourages you to stretch beyond your regular limitations. Unfortunately, everything is not as upbeat as you might expect, especially if you're reminded of a difficult time in your life. You may even begin to worry that something similar could happen again. Keep in mind that your fears only make things worse. Instead, lean on your innate wisdom to recognize the difference between then and now. Grab this opportunity to shine while it lasts."
capricorn,2014-04-10,"Your feet are so firmly planted on solid ground today that you can safely poke your head up into the clouds. However, you should be careful since the rug can be pulled out from under you if you lose touch with reality. This twist of fate may come as a rude surprise to you sure-footed Goats, especially if you climb too far, too fast. Enjoy your explorations into uncharted lands but don't forget the way back home. You will need to return to your practical perspective before you know it."
aquarius,2014-04-10,"If someone comes to you with a larger-than-life idea today, remember there's probably more to it than your realize. This isn't to suggest that the plan won't work; it's simply important to be aware that everything now appears better than it is. Look at all opportunities through the most realistic lens possible. And don't bother asking others for advice, for they'll just tell you what they think you want to hear. Your best bet is to wait a few days until your clarity returns."
pisces,2014-04-10,"You have a long list of mundane chores to finish today. Unfortunately, your fantasies may be much more interesting than what is actually happening in your real life. Luckily, if you change your attitude and get to work, you can make your reality nearly as awesome as you wish. However, don't let the details overwhelm you. Just fulfill your obligations as quickly as possible and then get back to whatever fills your spirit with fire."
aries,2014-04-11,"If you feel tired today with more on your plate than you can handle, this is an obvious sign that you need to take some time to reevaluate your current direction. First, think about what your heart truly wants and pretend that nothing could keep you from your goals. Secondly, consider the very real obstacles you must overcome to reach your destination. Then methodically make the necessary changes to put your life back on track."
taurus,2014-04-11,"There may be something quite reassuring about being with your friends now, but social activities distract you from making progress at work. You can tell that something is happening, but your progress seems to be hidden from sight. Trust your own counsel, even if your inner voice sounds uncertain. The fundamental changes you make today bring positive results if you are patient."
gemini,2014-04-11,"You might want to go along with everyone's plans for the day, but you don't like the idea of being so closely tied to their schedules. You're probably not as attached to tradition as some other people are, but there's something to be gained now by going along with the crowd. Even if you want to take a more radical approach, a bit of self-compromise can actually bring you closer to the elusive happiness you seek. Find joy in whatever you're doing; you'll have your chance for more variety soon enough."
cancer,2014-04-11,"You're ready to jump into a project and do whatever needs to be done. There's no reason to waste time on frivolous activities these days. Still, you're quite aware that maintaining a professional appearance ultimately brings you closer to the security that you seek. Remember, you don't have to give up your real goals; instead, just wait a while longer to make your big move."
leo,2014-04-11,"You have more than your fair share of common sense now, and even if this isn't normally your greatest strength, others are relying on you to hold things together. However, you might be motivated by something more personal than just helping everyone else. You are changing your life bit by bit in order to make your daily routines more efficient and productive. The more open you are to a variety of possibilities, the healthier this transition can be for you. This is your chance to bring your most colorful visions down to earth."
virgo,2014-04-11,"The potential for change is all around you. You may feel rather lighthearted today, unless you haven't already completed your work chores. However, once you are done you are ready to play, but you must know exactly what you are getting into before you can enjoy yourself. Don't scatter your energy before you meet your obligations or you might miss your chance to have fun later in the day. The more time you have away from your regular routine, the more time you have to explore all the possibilities on the horizon."
libra,2014-04-11,"You may feel that someone is on your case now; no matter what you do, you should have done something else. Today's analytical Virgo Moon can bring emotional stress with home activities and family members. You might need to justify your actions even if you try to avoid the conflict. Do whatever you must to get through the awkwardness of the current situation without attaching too much meaning to anything that happens. Thankfully, keeping the peace buys you time until you gain additional perspective."
scorpio,2014-04-11,"Even if you feel resistance emanating from others, you must take some of the responsibility for the tension. Your destiny is in your own hands; whatever situation you created you can unmake. But it will take a real commitment, along with enough courage to engage in a difficult conversation. Bringing someone into your confidence might be just the catalyst you need to transform the current dynamics."
sagittarius,2014-04-11,"You must be as practical as possible now in order to counterbalance everyone else's fuzzy thinking. But you could just as well be the ringleader of a pie-in-the-sky scheme, yourself. Either way, you have much to lose if you let your unbridled imagination run away with the facts. Making a list of the pros and cons enables you to sustain your newly found stability. Scaling your big ideas down to a manageable size greatly improves your chances of success."
capricorn,2014-04-11,"It's crucial to honor your feelings today, even if they aren't consistent with your previous plans. But don't think that the solution is to just drop whatever you are doing in favor of something new. You must find a workable balance between the opposite forces pushing and pulling on your life now. However, you might grow more confused as you try to resolve the dilemma. Thankfully, talking it over with friends can help, especially if you're willing to listen to their sound advice."
aquarius,2014-04-11,"Your imagination plays a significant role in your life today, but it's up to you to utilize the unrealized potential of the moment. Nevertheless, don't get so lost in your dreams that you can't keep up with your responsibilities. Go ahead and let your thoughts take you where they will without deviating from your regular schedule. Trusting your intuition is smart now, but keep your feet securely planted on the ground when reaching for the stars."
pisces,2014-04-11,"You are of two minds now. You would like to forget about your chores and join in the fun, but something prevents you from jumping overboard. There may be too much going on to escape from your previous commitments and you won't be able to enjoy yourself even if you do. Nevertheless, your friends are calling and they have an enticing plan. Take your time and make your choice only after you consider your options and decide what makes the most sense."
aries,2014-04-12,"You think that you can't tell your friends what you really want now because you're afraid of being judged. Nevertheless, several planets are traveling through your feisty sign, prompting you to take a risk and express your feelings anyhow. However, it's crucial to consider the impact of your words on a loved one before saying something that could be misinterpreted. Don't be afraid of sharing your truth; just know when to stop or you could find yourself enmeshed in an unnecessary drama."
taurus,2014-04-12,"Although your desires may seem deliciously warm this morning, it could get much hotter than you expect as your ruling planet, Venus, continues to lure you into the heat of fantasy today. However, if you believe that you have overstepped your bounds, you might cool off rather suddenly and pull away. Unfortunately, someone could misinterpret your behavior and assume that your emotional retreat is because of your lack of affection. Avoid needless problems by communicating clearly from the start."
gemini,2014-04-12,"You might feel relatively clueless about your direction today, but the more you try to map out your destination, the less you seem to know which way to go. Unfortunately, your rational analysis won't give you the whole picture now, for reality is being augmented by emotional rather than logical currents. Stop trying to think your way through these circumstances. Oddly enough, you gain a sense of freedom, or even temporary exhilaration, when you surrender to your feelings and follow your heart."
cancer,2014-04-12,"You could seem a bit absent-minded today as you slip in and out of contact with your imagination. However, if you lose touch with other planes of existence, they still make themselves known in the here and now. You can stretch your awareness and have momentary glimpses of how all the pieces fit together. But eventually, you may close back down and might even be confused by the whole experience. Luckily, it's possible to relieve some of your anxiety by remembering that life is a mystery after all."
leo,2014-04-12,"Reality may act just like a wet blanket as the truth dampens your spirits, especially if your expectations are overinflated now. But satisfaction might be within reach if you adjust your attitude so you can joyfully accept whatever opportunities you're being offered. This temporary setback isn't about lowering your standards; it's about practicing the art of being grateful for what you currently have. Counting your blessings is an excellent first step."
virgo,2014-04-12,"Your over-the-top optimism sets you up for disappointment today. Or, maybe, you're already discouraged and an enthusiastic friend tries to lift your spirits. No matter what occurs, you still might not feel very supported now. Just recognizing that others appreciate your talents and acknowledge your contributions could be enough to put you back on track. But don't withdraw if you feel misunderstood for any reason. Be clear about your intentions and you have a better chance of ultimately being seen for who you truly are."
libra,2014-04-12,"You're often the one who takes the time to understand what others are feeling, even if your empathy ends up making decisions more difficult. However, interactions with people around you might leave you with a sense of disillusionment today. Relationships may seem like a total mystery now and you don't even know where to begin to put things back in balance. Thankfully, cultivating emotional detachment allows your perspective to return to normal in just a few days. In the meantime, keep the lines of communication open without making any sudden moves."
scorpio,2014-04-12,"You don't ask for a lot today; all you want is the connection of familiarity with a close friend. Unfortunately, your support network might seem somewhat distant now, leaving you feeling lonely or nostalgic. However, it's not nearly as bad as it seems at first because the gulf between you and others won't last long, especially since it's largely the result of your own runaway imagination. Don't worry; the real world is on its way back, bringing more clarity along with it."
sagittarius,2014-04-12,"Your playful spirit might run into a wall today, but the external resistance won't hold you back for long. You may be required to readjust your goals, but that's just because they weren't all that realistic in the first place. Once you bring your hopes back into line, you could discover that the new obstacles will be much easier to overcome. If success starts to slip through your fingers, keep a positive attitude, reconsider your objectives and try again."
capricorn,2014-04-12,"You have no trouble acting as the taskmaster today while the Moon aligns with stern Saturn. However, playing this lead role can be more work than you expected because charming Venus is attempting to soften your heart. But neither flirtation nor temptation should distract you from your current goals. Don't give in; you must hold up your end of the bargain now by being the most responsible one in the group. Ultimately, others will appreciate your perseverance and singular focus."
aquarius,2014-04-12,"Sustaining your connection with your imagination isn't your top priority today because you want to produce tangible results. Although you're normally quite capable of depersonalizing your feelings so you can have a more universal understanding of reality and the human condition, today's Virgo Moon demands that you bring your ideas back down to earth. Don't go too far in either direction; seek ways to balance your dreams with your present circumstances so you can experience the best of both worlds."
pisces,2014-04-12,"Fitting yourself neatly into a box that's been created by someone else may be impossible today. But a close friend or partner has very specific expectations about how you should behave now, and you might not perform as desired. Conflicts between your personal styles or values is only a problem if one of you is so insecure that you need the other person to agree with you one hundred percent. Assure those you love that expressing your individuality doesn't mean you love them any less."
aries,2014-04-13,You may be so engrossed in the details of your life that you spend time on a task that ultimately proves to be relatively unimportant. Step out beyond your own personal dilemma long enough to see the situation from someone else's point of view. Backing away from the intensity enables you to broaden your perspective and perceive things in a whole new light. Anything is possible if you're ready to take a calculated risk and then work to make your dreams come true.
taurus,2014-04-13,"Looking your very best makes you feel confident enough to take on the world. But too much emphasis on glamour is a trap and you could get hooked into worrying about superficial matters. No matter how sharp you appear today, you still might be feeling insecure. Go ahead and be as stylish as you want, but don't let it stand in the way of being yourself. Your authenticity makes you much more attractive than keeping up with the newest fad or fashion. All it takes is to shine your light from within."
gemini,2014-04-13,"The pressure of responsibility is intensifying today, but it won't prevent your excitement from growing along with it. However, you're eager to inject a bit of joy into a sobering situation. Don't be shy; celebrate this energetic shift by spontaneously playing with friends or expressing yourself creatively. Having a little fun now is a great antidote for these serious times."
cancer,2014-04-13,"Choosing the exact words to share your story could be quite a challenge today. You have something you need to get off your chest, yet you aren't certain how to approach the topic. Maintain objectivity and avoid being overly emotional as you address specific situations rather than general concepts. Although your passion can be quite convincing, it's more important now to be precise so that others understand your message."
leo,2014-04-13,"You know what everyone wants and are wise to trust your intuition today. But overconfidence might present problems, so show some humility along the way. Your persuasive charm and unflappable determination combines to make a stronger statement than you realize. Paradoxically, your intensity can have the opposite effect from what you want now, leaving you confused because you can't convince anyone to join you. Don't try so hard; letting go of your expectations gives others the space they need in order to say yes."
virgo,2014-04-13,"It's not too late to show your compassion and offer words of praise instead of constructive criticism. It's often easy to point out the flaws in those you love, but you don't realize how harsh your casual judgment can sound. Being gentle in your approach improves the delivery of your message. Remember that it's not always about aspiring for perfection; it's ultimately about giving positive reinforcement that encourages growth and transformation."
libra,2014-04-13,"Your careful preparations will be rewarded today, especially if you take time to consider how others might react to your behavior. Unfortunately, having everything in order is not enough. You must also focus on your own feelings now that the reflective Moon is back in your sign. Don't worry about recognition; there will be plenty of time for acknowledgment later on. Just do your inner work and stay in touch with your heart."
scorpio,2014-04-13,"Your idealistic intentions are commendable but you must balance them with conscious restraint now to give them the chance they deserve. If you indiscriminately scatter your energy everywhere, your assistance won't have the positive impact you want. Keep in mind that working on your own spiritual development can, paradoxically, be your greatest gift to others. When you are centered and coming from a place of love, your mere presence is a powerful healing force."
sagittarius,2014-04-13,"You may be especially productive if you are collaborating with other people today. The responsive Moon is currently hanging out in your 11th House of Groups, enabling you to reach your goals without upsetting the collective process. If you are in charge, consider how each person on the team can successfully contribute to the overall project. Take time to make the best strategic assignments now, for this is your surest path to success."
capricorn,2014-04-13,"You innately understand how to inspire people to push beyond their normal limits. The diplomatic Libra Moon is visiting your 10th House of Career, empowering you to assume a position of authority today. Just remember that you don't have to make promises you can't keep just because you want to please someone. Setting ambitious goals is crucial now, but don't raise the bar so high that it's out of reach."
aquarius,2014-04-13,"Your need for greater independence encourages you to try things on your own, but flying solo isn't the most effective route to reach your destination now. Slow down and seek out the advice of an expert today; you really don't have to reinvent everything yourself. The savings in time and energy is well worth it and could quickly give you a boost of momentum on your way to achieving your objectives."
pisces,2014-04-13,"You can see the beauty in an unorthodox approach to a problem, but you could miss the mark today if you don't think things through to their conclusion. Before sharing anything with others, make sure your ideas are solid enough to bother defending in the heat of battle. Steer clear of endless debate, for open conflict, even if it's civil, won't likely lead anywhere productive. You have a choice now; pick peace over unnecessary drama."
aries,2014-04-14,"Considering everyone's feelings prior to initiating action means making decisions is very difficult today because you see everything from multiple perspectives. Even if you are in tune with your desires, you may be unsure of the best time to make your move. However, you might think you don't have the option of waiting, but that comes from a false sense of urgency. Stop to assess the alternatives and postpone your final choices as long as possible. In this case, doing your research really counts."
taurus,2014-04-14,"Your natural tendency is to tackle your tasks one at a time and just methodically plow through them. However, there's so much going on now that you might not be able to decide where to begin. Unfortunately, procrastination is not the answer today because the longer you put off the inevitable, the harder it gets. Be courageous and jump in anywhere you can. Things will fall into place once you quit worrying and get to work."
gemini,2014-04-14,"You might think that you can have fun while running errands or doing your chores today, but you may need to work hard to overcome the obstacles you encounter along the way. You could even wonder if someone is blocking your progress, but don't jump to any hasty conclusions before you have sufficient facts to support your concerns. It's best to keep moving toward your goals rather than wasting time rationalizing why you should turn around and give up. Taking the high road gives you an opportunity to shine."
cancer,2014-04-14,"It's a bit simplistic to believe that you can accommodate everyone's needs just because you see a complex issue from all angles. Although you may not have an easy answer, you could be the right person to mediate a serious domestic conflict today. Nevertheless, the picture might grow more complicated if you feel pressure to take sides. Don't be afraid to establish strong boundaries by letting others know that you will share your assessment only after you are ready."
leo,2014-04-14,"You want to take the time to hear everyone's plans for the future before revealing your own. Unfortunately, you might need to make a critical decision that ends up disappointing someone, even if you do your best to take the concerns of others into consideration. It's great to be optimistic in your outlook, but you won't likely agree with every person involved. Explain your choices as kindly and firmly as possible; the best thing you can do next is to lead by example and move on."
virgo,2014-04-14,"Your analytical skills are your greatest strength now, especially when you build on your previous work instead of beginning something new. However, you might face your own internal resistance before taking your work to the next level today. Although your fear of failure could make you worry that your efforts will go unnoticed, this isn't the right time to reassess your direction. Just stick to your present path with as much confidence as you can muster; you may be progressing faster now than you realize."
libra,2014-04-14,"You don't have a lot of patience with others who act selfishly, but it's awkward to tell them what they already should know. You're on edge with the evocative Moon back in your sign now; however, it's a mistake to keep your annoyance quiet just to maintain the peace. Unfortunately, there could be an emotional price to pay if you don't express yourself today. The good news is that with a little social finesse you can remain authentic without placing blame on anyone else."
scorpio,2014-04-14,"Every task -- no matter how minor -- is more complicated when you cannot make up your mind about what to do first. Ironically, the facts seem clear, yet you're struggling with a dilemma as your imagination pulls you in opposite directions today. Unfortunately, your refusal to give up on either side prevents you from making the best choice. Your best bet is to wait out your uncertainty until the answer becomes more apparent. In the meantime, flexibility is your friend."
sagittarius,2014-04-14,"Expressing your emotions honestly always sounds like the best policy, but a spontaneous declaration of love may not go over very well today. Unfortunately, writing about the desires of your heart in an email or text won't necessarily fare any better. Mischievous Mercury's influence can bend your emotions out of shape, so you might not have a very clear perspective now, even if you believe you do. Only fools rush in; be smart and wait a few days before saying what's on your mind. Channel your passion into expressing your creativity instead."
capricorn,2014-04-14,"You may have to play the role of the bad guy in a family conflict today. Or, perhaps someone is in dire need of your parenting skills now. However, you would rather hold a neutral position while you listen to everyone's concerns. Even if you've had more than enough of hearing other people complain, you don't have the luxury of being able to let your attention wander. Seeking the meaning behind the words instead of being distracted by the emotional intensity can trigger the breakthrough you were hoping for all along."
aquarius,2014-04-14,"You have things to do that you've never done before, but fortunately, you like the excitement of new experiences. Your knack for balancing what you know with the unknown comes in handy today. However, you still must exercise caution or you could become lackadaisical in your approach. There's very little margin for error, so don't get lazy. Lowering your guard now is a likely invitation to trouble. Enjoy the adrenaline rush of embarking on an adventure, but make sure to be back home in time for dinner."
pisces,2014-04-14,"You are strong enough to handle the deep emotions of those around you, but you may be riding a seesaw today as you try to balance someone else's feelings with your own. You truly want to be present for those you love, but you're unsure about opening up to outside negativity now. The real lesson comes from being a supportive friend while still maintaining healthy boundaries. Your compassion can have a much more powerful impact if you're willing to share your heart."
aries,2014-04-15,"Your impulsive nature is even more reactive than ever today. The Libra Full Moon Eclipse electrifies your 7th House of Relationships, pulling you out of your comfort zone as you attempt to keep peace with your partner. Although it's easy to say that the next time you will think before you act, it's going to take consistent effort to follow through on your good intentions. Nevertheless, tempering your sense of immediacy has a calming effect now on everyone involved."
taurus,2014-04-15,"Today's top priority is to find a comfortable middle ground between being selfish and taking care of others. Your sweet nature inspires you to act in a selfless manner today as the Libra Full Moon Eclipse polarizes your 6th House of Service. Thankfully, you also know how important it is to fulfill your own needs. Avoid getting swept up in a cause unless it is an issue that is close to your heart. Following your moral compass guides you to give back generously in ways that really count."
gemini,2014-04-15,"Although you may be willing to go along with the group's plans now, you still must make time to have a meaningful interaction that involves just you and one special person. Today's Libra Full Moon is eclipsed in your 5th House of Self-Expression, prompting you to say what's on your mind. Naturally, it's fun to hang out with your friends, but don't let the possibility of transient pleasure be a distraction from the tougher issues you need to address. Establish your priorities and initiate a serious discussion with the one you love."
cancer,2014-04-15,"You are easily annoyed if professional obligations keep you from spending time with your family now. The Libra Full Moon Eclipse emphasizes your 4th House of Emotional Security, reminding you of the contrast between the life you live at home and the one you experience out in the world. However, it's liberating once you realize that you don't have to make a choice. You just need to balance these two aspects of your life the best you can without turning frustration into resentment. Oddly enough, a shift in your attitude may be all it takes to make everyone happy."
leo,2014-04-15,"You may have plenty of expectations about where a current friendship can take you. However, now that the Libra Full Moon Eclipse shakes up your 3rd House of Information, your plans might not reach fruition unless you're willing to discuss your concerns. Express your emotions without blaming anyone else or you could get sidetracked by an unnecessary conflict that sidesteps the real issue. Facing your fears isn't so scary if you keep the lines of communication open."
virgo,2014-04-15,"You might think that your intentions are obvious to others and that you are truly sharing your innermost feelings now; however, you still remain an enigma to those around you. The Libra Full Moon Eclipse lands in your 2nd House of Values, requiring you to look within yourself to uncover deeply rooted beliefs that block your expression. Bring what's most important to you out into the open today or things may not turn out the way you wish. Your willingness to be transparent helps everyone involved gain more clarity."
libra,2014-04-15,"Finding the harmony that you wish to have in your personal relationships is elusive now. Today's Lunar Eclipse occurs in your sign, indicating that you or someone very close to you may be dealing with unexpressed emotions that stand in the way of intimacy. Holding back what really needs to be said only makes matters worse. But shifting the focus by accusing another person of wrongdoing won't help either. Taking the high road by sharing your fears first enables you to find solutions by looking ahead rather than searching for causes in the past."
scorpio,2014-04-15,"Sometimes it's impossible for you to keep cool when your emotions heat up. However, other times you can feel so agitated that you turn to ice in order to prevent the situation from boiling over. Today's Libra Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 12th House of Secrets, challenging you to engage with those around you without overwhelming them with your intensity. Thankfully, following your regular routine allows you to channel your nervous energy into less volatile activities. Throwing yourself into your work might be enough to take the edge off."
sagittarius,2014-04-15,"You may be a hopeless romantic searching for love, but instead you only find playful pals as today's Libra Full Moon Eclipse triggers your 11th House of Social Networking and your 5th House of Romance. Although there is surely nothing wrong with the camaraderie of good friendship, it isn't the same as the more intimate relationship you want now. Don't get discouraged and go silent. Keeping your heart open can ultimately attract the type of soul connection you seek."
capricorn,2014-04-15,"You are in high demand on the job today, but this professional popularity might place pressure on the home front as the Libra Full Moon Eclipse stresses your 10th House of Career. Don't try to cover your insecurities by shifting into overdrive if you are unsure you can fulfill all your responsibilities. Even if putting in more hours at work seems logical, it can exhaust you -- and you still may not complete your assignments. Instead, establish a sustainable pace now so you have more time to spend with those you love."
aquarius,2014-04-15,"You could be treading on unstable ground today as you attempt to keep a previously scheduled trip on track. You might even worry about travel plans falling apart now that the Libra Full Moon Eclipse overstimulates your 9th House of Faraway Places. But don't let your irrational fears impact your current decisions. Even if you're ready to just pack your bags and go, consider all your options before picking one path and following it off into the sunset."
pisces,2014-04-15,"Staring down your deepest fears might not be your idea of fun, but intense emotional issues appear in a variety of forms now. The Libra Full Moon Eclipse falls in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, indicating a possible struggle with an intimate partner. However, one of the benefits of interacting with someone you love is discovering previously hidden parts of yourself. Shining your light of awareness into the shadows can reveal buried treasure if you have the courage to delve into the unknown."
aries,2014-04-16,"You tend to express what's on your mind without hesitation, but you need to be extra careful today before opening your mouth or you may face unpleasant consequences. You might have so much to say about a particular topic that it comes across as if you've been suppressing it for a while. However, you haven't necessarily been holding back; it's just that you're ready to throw caution to the wind now. Thankfully, simply considering the ramifications of your words and your actions could save you from an uncomfortable situation."
taurus,2014-04-16,"As much as you might want to compromise today, you can still be pretty stubborn when it comes down to something that matters. You may act in a diplomatic manner, but you could annoy someone if you try to gloss over the difficulties without answering the tough questions. Decide what is more important now -- your ego or your peace of mind. Once you make your choice, your next move will be obvious."
gemini,2014-04-16,"When push comes to shove, you cleverly start to plan your escape route. You don't necessarily enjoy direct confrontation unless it is done in the spirit of mutual respect. However, there may be an irrepressible emotional issue that ripples to the surface today. Whether or not it's a smart idea to pursue resolution doesn't seem to matter because you're ready to rumble. Don't be the victim of circumstance; use your powers of self-restraint to avoid an unnecessary meltdown. Sometimes the best offense is to just walk away."
cancer,2014-04-16,"You need to pay attention to your thoughts because what you don't say can be a source of trouble. Your inner voice is attempting to convince you to communicate a significant message to someone at work. You may come very close to opening a can of worms, leaving you with a real mess to clean up. On the other hand, if you say nothing, your hurt could turn to anger and resentment now, which isn't any better. Seek the elusive middle path for the best possible results."
leo,2014-04-16,"Your thoughts are quite loud today -- maybe even too noisy for your own good. You can irritate others if you don't let them complete their sentences before you respond to what they haven't yet said. They might even falsely assume that you're not interested in sharing the spotlight. From your point of view, it's just a matter of expediency. You want to take the fastest route to the finish line. Paradoxically, if you slow down and listen now, you will have a real shot at finishing first."
virgo,2014-04-16,"You can execute nearly any mental maneuvers like a skilled general today. But be careful about coming out with all guns blazing because revealing too much aggression has a funny way of backfiring. Your key planet Mercury opposes warrior Mars now so it's wise to rely on your intellect rather than direct action. Fortunately, your sharp verbal and analytical skills will serve you well as long as you don't lose your temper. Cool your jets and think twice before you speak once."
libra,2014-04-16,"Although your friends and associates may be extremely nice to you, something is still bothering you enough to trigger an emotional response. Thankfully, you probably will exhibit enough wisdom to keep your negative feelings to yourself. Instead, dissipate the emotional energy by working it off doing chores and buzzing around like a busy bee. Meanwhile, you still might feel angry, even if it seems inappropriate. Moderate your reaction and say as little as possible until you have things back in perspective. Better safe than sorry now when it comes to sharing your heart."
scorpio,2014-04-16,"You are drawn into the mesmerizing mysteries of your own imagination today. Anything beyond your five senses is a captivating attraction, luring you down a metaphorical rabbit hole. However, you may be seeking hidden meanings where there just aren't any, and your frustration can make you cranky. Even if you feel a bit paranoid now, don't blame anyone else for the images arising from your subconscious. Just sit back and enjoy the show."
sagittarius,2014-04-16,"Your thoughts are zipping around today, possibly moving so fast that you can't even finish one idea before you jump to the next one. Others may criticize you for your sloppy thinking, but their negativity only irritates you since you were hoping for their support. Instead of posturing to defend your ideas, use the feedback you receive to help sharpen your perceptions and improve your plans. There is a distinct advantage to being a team player now rather than trying to prove you can do everything on your own."
capricorn,2014-04-16,"You want to bring a serious thought out into the open, but you fear there will be serious fallout from what you have to say. You might have been hurt emotionally and it's still difficult to express your pain. You may be mad at someone, but you don't relish hurting their feelings, too. Naturally, you think through the conversation beforehand so your message will be both clear and fair. The only problem is that once you begin to talk, you quickly go off script. Relax; everything will be alright if you speak from your heart and not your head."
aquarius,2014-04-16,"You may feel as if your energy is all backed up like a sewage system in a commercial for a 24-hour emergency plumber. You make the call, but the plumber's phone number has been disconnected. Thankfully, your current situation is not nearly as bad as it seems now. However, your panicky reactions could be a large part of the problem. Even if this seems like a weird time, it's best not to do anything too drastic. Trusting your intuition is more helpful in the long run than jumping to an erroneous conclusion that just makes matters worse."
pisces,2014-04-16,"There's no reason to play the role of a victim today. If reality is giving you a hard time, simply acknowledge your part in the current drama. The truth is that the present circumstances are unfolding with your participation and in some unknown way according to your plan. Even if you feel overwhelmed, remember you can methodically navigate your way through these crazy times as long as you don't expect everything to change overnight."
aries,2014-04-17,"You may be worried about the consequences of taking time off now because you believe that you shouldn't receive the goodies without putting in the effort. So, instead of heading out to play with your friends, you're probably working like a busy bee today. Although your conscientious attitude is admirable, it's also important to stop and enjoy the fruits of your labors. Make the most of your day by setting aside a bit of time to live in the present moment and have fun."
taurus,2014-04-17,"Although you might set out to be practical today, common sense quickly loses ground to the possibility of finding pleasure. Your desires are intense and satisfaction appears to be within reach now, so it's difficult for anyone to talk you out of your pursuit of happiness. Happily, your key planet Venus is harmonizing with indulgent Jupiter this evening, indicating that there's no reason to deny yourself a delightful experience. Stop questioning your luck and gratefully accept the blessings of the day."
gemini,2014-04-17,"You have a charmed day on your hands and you may not even be required to wave your magic wand or recite a secret incantation to make everything go your way. Ironically, you don't have to work hard to have your wishes fulfilled; it might feel as if you won the lottery for no reason at all. So, let go of any lingering negativity and take the good fortune as it comes. Put off some of your chores until tomorrow. Go out and play while the planets are smiling in your direction."
cancer,2014-04-17,"It's probably not your style to express everything you feel, but you still might find yourself stepping beyond your normal limits today. Even if you believe you're being cautious, your need for an emotional escapade is heightened now -- and you're ready to stir up some excitement. Although the current opportunity for finding pleasure may be quite unexpected, there's no time like the present to say yes. You'll never know unless you try."
leo,2014-04-17,"It may be nearly impossible for others to hold you back from having your fun today, and yet you might not be able to contain yourself either. The good news is that you have an excellent chance of finding the love, money or acceptance that you are currently seeking. The bad news is that whatever wonderful experiences come your way now, they probably won't last. Don't try to capture the magic; just follow your bliss and let your heart dance with joy."
virgo,2014-04-17,"Rewards for your creativity are closer than you realize, but you need to set clear priorities and pay attention to what's most important. Luckily, an opportunity to enjoy yourself might be a part of your payoff. Even if you're worried that your feelings are based on wishes rather than reality, you are still likely to go ahead and express them anyhow. This lack of inhibition isn't your normal style, but you may feel certain that this is your chance to create a memorable experience. Jump right in; the water's fine."
libra,2014-04-17,"You feel like you're rolling in a field of four-leaf clovers today because not much can go wrong when your key planet Venus forms an easy trine with auspicious Jupiter. It may not matter what's specifically going on for you now because you can create something magical, even if you don't have the best ingredients. However, if you overindulge your senses or overspend on unnecessary luxuries, you could wake up tomorrow regretting your lapse of good judgment. Fun is yours for the taking, but moderation is essential."
scorpio,2014-04-17,"Although you might not be able to break free from previous obligations, you can still find ways to make the day more enjoyable than you expect. Even in the midst of a tough situation, your long-term opportunities are looking great. You must do whatever makes you feel good about yourself, for the rewards will follow if you do. Don't be afraid to take a risk; expressing your heart's desire now can move you closer to achieving it."
sagittarius,2014-04-17,"You can see fabulous possibilities nearly everywhere you look today. Your positive attitude is capable of inspiring even those who are lost in the doldrums. It's difficult for others to remain down in your presence while your key planet Jupiter harmonizes with beautiful Venus, casting a lovely glow onto most everything in your life. You may even be on the most wanted list now -- not for punishment, but rather for fun and games. Enjoy the temporary notoriety while it lasts."
capricorn,2014-04-17,"Your optimism grows throughout the day, but you can be in danger of overextending yourself. Everything appears to be coming up roses, but it might not be as awesome as you think. You may have a quiet sense of self-satisfaction now that temporarily releases you from the stresses of your everyday life. Others appreciate your support and admire your ambitious nature. Nearly everyone wants to help you today and you would be wise to let them."
aquarius,2014-04-17,"All kinds of positive events are happening in your life now, yet they might not be apparent to anyone else. The real action is taking place deep within the recesses of your own subconscious mind -- yet you can tell these changes are real. Be careful not to get so sidetracked by your current optimism that you fail to see potential trouble spots. Coworkers may share their plans for fun today and you're ready to join them without a second thought. Remember, it's all too easy to say yes, even if there are other things you should be doing first."
pisces,2014-04-17,"Even the stickiest of circumstances will smooth out today without too much effort on your part. A potential conflict that appears to be heading toward a showdown can be effectively averted with just a simple gesture of compromise. However, it's not that all your problems are vanishing into thin air. More likely, the rain clouds are simply dissipating and you are reminded how delicious the sunshine feels. Enjoy your bliss while it lasts because your responsibilities will call you back to work soon enough."
aries,2014-04-18,"You might not know what's around the next corner, but you can see unexplored possibilities everywhere you look. Unfortunately, you don't have enough time in the day to pursue every intriguing opportunity. Therefore, establishing priorities is the most crucial component to your happiness now. Luckily, the idea of slowing down and doing less sounds good to you today, making it easier to pare back your activities. Spreading yourself too thin could prevent you from finishing what you start. Choose quality over quantity for a change."
taurus,2014-04-18,"You're not too eager to jump into something new today even if you're feeling more confident about a recent decision. It isn't that you're worried about the uncertainties ahead; it's just that you have a better chance of achieving success if you take your time now and proceed slowly. Remember, there's no reason to stress out because of someone else's arbitrary schedule. Set a pace that works for you and then stick to it."
gemini,2014-04-18,"People seem to have unrealistic expectations about what you might accomplish today, and you aren't interested in arguing with them. Nevertheless, you don't want to make yourself crazy by working extra hard when you know you can't meet an impossible deadline. Even if it is uncomfortable to address the real issue up front, everyone will feel relieved if you do. Don't turn your disclosure into a major drama; simply be honest and clearly tell others what you know you can deliver. Revealing your vulnerability is scary, but it will serve you well in the long run."
cancer,2014-04-18,"You are often all too aware of your limitations, but may get so caught up in your eagerness to please today that you commit to more than you can possibly manage. Unfortunately, your good intentions aren't enough to power you through the day, especially if you're delayed by unforeseen obstacles. However, there's no reason to sell yourself short. Don't be too concerned about completing your tasks on time; it's better to strive for perfection now than to sacrifice quality by rushing your work."
leo,2014-04-18,"Your roar may be a bit muted today but, thankfully, no one seems to notice but you. Your coworkers see your positive attitude and unwavering commitment in action and they believe that you're rock solid even if that's not how you actually feel. However, it's not a smart strategy to talk about your insecurities now; there's no point in exposing your weaknesses unless you have no choice. You can improve your chances for success by keeping your feelings private for a few more days while you concentrate on giving the best performance of your life."
virgo,2014-04-18,"You may have a clear picture of where you want to go now, but cannot find a direct route that gets you there quickly. All the roads before you appear more circuitous than you prefer. Fortunately, whatever path you pick will probably straighten out once you are on your way. The best strategy might be to just head off in the most sensible direction without worrying if you are making the right choice. There are many ways to reach your destination; just don't forget to appreciate the scenery along the way."
libra,2014-04-18,"Your illusions intertwine with reality today, making it tricky to separate fact from fiction. Paradoxically, it might not matter which is which because your visions have the potential to become real if you believe in yourself. Putting too much faith in the analytical data sets up artificial limits that could end up preventing you from realizing your highest potential. Thankfully, a bit of magical thinking now can inspire you to manifest your dreams."
scorpio,2014-04-18,"Your emotions may settle down today, enabling you to concentrate on your backlog of work. But your newfound ability to remain objective doesn't necessarily mean that production will be a piece of cake. You have to work extra hard for everything you want to accomplish now. Although setting your goals unrealistically high motivates you to reach for the stars, you could grow discouraged and give up too soon. Remember, dreams are wishes your heart makes, so don't let the limiting thoughts of your head stand between you and success."
sagittarius,2014-04-18,"You have the chance to catch up at work today if you roll up your sleeves and get busy. The Moon's monthly visit to your optimistic sign can be revitalizing while she harmonizes with brilliant Uranus and energetic Mars. As long as you stay in motion, you should be fine. Don't stop to think about what you're doing; just continue to do it. Normally, logic is an essential tool for making decisions; however, it only clutters your path with confusion now. Instead of wasting time justifying your choices, simply remember that actions speak louder than words."
capricorn,2014-04-18,"You may be struggling between two mindsets today. You can see the advantage of initiating decisive action based on your ambitious plans. Your organizational skills come to the rescue, enabling you to make substantial progress now. However, you also understand the risk of doing too much too fast. Nothing positive comes from erecting a house on an unstable foundation, so take your time and make sure you build it right."
aquarius,2014-04-18,"Your friends and associates are eager to give you extra words of encouragement today. But you still need to maintain a healthy perspective on what you can finish or you could quickly burn yourself out in the process. Although positive feedback from your allies feels great, it might fill you with so much confidence that you take on one too many challenges. Proceed with caution; if it's a great idea, it will look even better tomorrow. In the meantime, let others know how much you appreciate their support."
pisces,2014-04-18,"Your compassion is normally one of your greatest strengths, but it could actually get in the way of your productivity today. Although the Moon's visit to your 10th House of Public Responsibility encourages you to nurture nearly everyone, this is an impossible task. Nevertheless, you might wear yourself out trying to help more people than you can. Creating healthy boundaries is a crucial step in your current efforts to positively impact those who need you the most. Keep in mind that there's a fine line between being a saint and being a martyr."
aries,2014-04-19,"You don't appreciate anyone trying to control you, but defending your territory today could escalate argumentative words into something more. A minor conflict may heat up way beyond its initial scope and then take days or even weeks to settle back down. Keep in mind that you can be honest and direct without being unkind. Practicing the art of compassion enables you to be part of the solution instead of the problem."
taurus,2014-04-19,"You are extremely serious about making long-term plans today, even if other people seem resistant to your ideas. But you aren't willing to wait for formal approval if you think that delaying the final commitment now could place your entire enterprise in jeopardy. Don't panic; it's not helpful to act impulsively when it comes to your future. If you push others too hard their support may be short-lived. Avoid getting swept up in a wave of change unless it's going your way."
gemini,2014-04-19,"Fundamental changes in a relationship may have already started to modify your attitude about expressing your emotions. If you usually prefer tap dancing your way around deep feelings because they make you uncomfortable, this is your chance to evolve in a profound manner. Consider spending more time exploring the shadows of awareness now that you know the real magic is hidden from the light of day. But keep in mind that you can't start a serious dialogue until you open your heart."
cancer,2014-04-19,"Although you're often eager to sink into the subjective world of emotions, someone else may be one step ahead of you these days. But you're not interested in being drawn into other people's dramas today, especially if you already have too much on your plate. There's a trick to being compassionate without giving away your power. Create whatever boundaries you need now in order to maintain your integrity and your sanity."
leo,2014-04-19,"You might try to squeeze in some exciting activities today, but your calendar probably doesn't have much extra room. You realize that the fun may be coming to an end for a while and you have an important role to play over the days ahead. But you're stepping onto new ground, making it even more complicated to navigate your way. It's less about getting your needs met now than it is about minimizing them so you can help others. Don't harbor ill will toward those who could use your support; your positive attitude alone improves the situation."
virgo,2014-04-19,"Scheduling spontaneous playtime may seem like an oxymoron, but a more structured approach to your day gives you the stability you need to let loose. Having some fun at home is a great idea now as long as you acknowledge what everyone else wants too. But don't try to talk anyone into following your game plan; just stick to your agenda and invite your inner artist out to play. Once others see you having such a good time today, they will naturally want to join in."
libra,2014-04-19,"Give yourself the luxury of not adhering to a calendar for a while. Even if you have valid reasons why you should stay at home today, everyone else is heading out to have fun. As much as a part of you wants to fit into the group dynamic, it's more critical now for you to reconnect with what's in your own heart. You're tempted to deal with your dilemma on a purely intellectual basis, but it's much healthier to keep your emotions in the mix. Although it might surprise others, a little time alone may be just what you need to figure out what you really want."
scorpio,2014-04-19,"You could try to ride the brakes today, but oddly enough slowing down just seems to make everything feel more intense. Protecting your money or property may be an important theme now, but make sure that you're not just reacting out of fear. Separating your emotions from your current need for stability helps to prevent you from getting carried away by your expectations. Anything can happen if you remain open to the element of surprise."
sagittarius,2014-04-19,"You are a person on a mission now and there's little that will keep you from your self-appointed tasks. If you set your heart on a specific destination, you are sure that you can reach it no matter what the cost. However, it's a smart idea to tread carefully because you might inadvertently hurt someone's feelings in your haste. There's nothing wrong with taking a little extra time to check in with those you love even if they're acting like everything is fine. Success is sweeter when shared."
capricorn,2014-04-19,"You may sense that your window of opportunity is closing fast and you haven't yet received an acknowledgment for your contribution. Instead of waiting for others to say something today, do whatever is necessary to change your expectations and talk yourself out of your current need for recognition. You will be happier if you withdraw for a while to recharge your emotional batteries now instead of hanging your success on anyone else's opinion. When it comes down to it, the only one you really need to impress is yourself."
aquarius,2014-04-19,"Sometimes being a part of a group experience can be the most amazing thing in the world as your individuality merges with a larger cause. However, if others attempt to coerce you into supporting them now, hold firm to your position even if it means going your own way. Don't do anything that doesn't make intuitive sense to you. Even if you're not so sure about your decision today, trusting your gut won't likely lead you astray. It's more essential than ever to dance to the rhythm of your own drum."
pisces,2014-04-19,"Your friends and family might make you crazy today as they try to drag you into their personal battles. Fortunately, you have the sense to gauge what's important now and for the weeks ahead. But don't unilaterally put an end to an argument by just walking away to avoid it; denial only leads to bigger problems later. Spend some time in quiet contemplation so you can establish a whole new set of priorities. Reconnecting with others after you develop a healthier perspective enables you to remain grounded when you step back into the drama."
aries,2014-04-20,"You might think that nearly anything is possible today, no matter how outrageous your goals sound to anyone else. Although the power of positive thought plays a leading role in improving your chances of success, you could go overboard with your ambitious plans. Be responsible and demonstrate your maturity by acknowledging your limits. Even a little common sense goes a long way now to moderate your enthusiasm and ultimately satisfy your need to get what you want. Turning your volume down just a notch makes room for others to offer their support."
taurus,2014-04-20,"You see big potential for positive change everywhere you look today, but you're not likely to gamble with your current possessions for a possible pie in the sky. Fortunately, the willful Sun's current return to your earthbound sign may be enough to keep both your feet on the ground. Knowing exactly what is possible can be very empowering, but ultimately it's your determination and hard work that make the difference between failure and success."
gemini,2014-04-20,"Although your ingenious plans for the future might seem incredulous to your friends, you're pretty confident that you can execute them just as they unfold in your imagination. However, you may grow more reserved as you begin to realize how much effort is required to defend your position now. It's probably wise to conserve your energy today, but don't retreat completely. You could still build excitement by sharing the buzz of some of your ideas as long as you keep a healthy perspective. Trust your vision and don't let anyone rain on your parade."
cancer,2014-04-20,"You're suddenly being drawn into the public eye, whether or not you like it. Actually, you may even feel as if you're being catapulted out from behind your protective wall. Although the adrenaline shooting through your body could be causing anxiety, you can calm your nerves by taking time to meditate or exercise. You might not be able to easily change the external events today, but you're certainly capable of changing the way you respond to stress. A healthy sense of humor helps you take life's twists and turns in stride."
leo,2014-04-20,"You may feel as if you're on a rollercoaster ride again and even if you are enjoying all the excitement, the intensity could quickly get old. You're longing for a break from the extreme highs and lows so you can relax for a while. The disparity between the current frenzy and your desire for peace might be disheartening. Embrace the fact that you are in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime adventure and live each moment to the fullest. Be bold and roar as if you are the King of the Jungle."
virgo,2014-04-20,"You could be a bit overwhelmed with all the changes coming at you these days. But even if you are surprised at how well you're holding up under the pressure now, you still have a lot to juggle while making an important decision. Trust your instincts today because analyzing the facts one more time won't necessarily bring you any closer to the truth. It's time to move out of your head and act decisively to manifest your dreams."
libra,2014-04-20,"It's nearly impossible to keep up with all the unexpected drama in your life. In particular, relationships seem to be the primary source of excitement these days, especially if a friend or partner is pushing you into new territory. However, the trick is to learn how to be close to someone else without becoming overly dependent. Oddly enough, the more freedom you maintain, the happier everyone involved will be with this experiment. Exploring your independence isn't necessarily easy but it can lead to a significant breakthrough. Spread your wings and fly."
scorpio,2014-04-20,"You naturally crave intensity, but you might also dream about taking some time away from today's hectic pace. Although experiencing peace and quiet may be relaxing for a little while, your mind anxiously starts to run your own version of the current distractions. Rather than seeking tranquility by changing your situation, create the harmony you want by calming your mind. But don't set yourself up for failure by expecting a miracle overnight. You can learn a spiritual lesson from the beautiful butterfly; metamorphosis cannot be rushed."
sagittarius,2014-04-20,"It's crucial to filter out enough of the chaos so you can concentrate on achieving your goals. You may have your work set out for you today because it's not easy to reach the destination you have chosen. However, there's no reason to scale back your agenda. Instead, make a concrete plan and then follow it as best you can. Leading with common sense now won't prevent you from reaching the stars, but impulsively rushing in could complicate your journey. Aim high but keep your feet firmly planted on the ground."
capricorn,2014-04-20,"You're able to rise above the noise du jour and find a way to collect your thoughts without losing momentum. In the midst of this rather crazy cosmic storm, you can earn the respect of your closest friends by maintaining a cool and calm attitude today. Fortunately, you don't have to rain on anyone's parade while standing up and speaking the voice of reason. Your practical perspective is greatly appreciated now; others will benefit from your logical approach during such illogical times."
aquarius,2014-04-20,"Don't bother attempting to regain control of your life today because the more you try to cling to the status quo, the greater your struggle. Instead, jump into the flow of things by responding to each shifting breeze no matter which way the wind is blowing. Your brilliance is apparent to everyone now if you don't exhaust yourself fighting to change that which is unalterable. Instead of chasing an unachievable goal like transforming lemons into apples, just laugh and make lemon meringue pie."
pisces,2014-04-20,"There's no reason to gamble with your time or money today in pursuit of an impossible dream, especially if you have more tangible goals to manifest. Using your imagination to create your ideal version of the future doesn't mean that your head has to be up in the clouds. Your current genius stems from your uncanny ability to act with common sense instead of buying into someone's innovative theory. Good ideas have no value now unless you can find a practical way to apply them to the real world."
aries,2014-04-21,"You believe you have a foolproof plan but it's all too easy to overlook something very obvious now. Even if there's nothing wrong with your strategy, you still need to exercise extreme caution so you don't inadvertently overstep any boundaries today. Don't overcompensate by retreating in haste or worrying about every single move you make. Just stay aware of other people's feelings so you don't ride roughshod over them. There is a powerful strength in community; fortunately, you don't have to do the heavy lifting on your own."
taurus,2014-04-21,"You can look at the world through x-ray lenses today, but your ability to see through the facade complicates your life. Your perceptions are very keen and your logic is sound, so don't be afraid of trusting your current conclusions. Reevaluating your priorities enables you to be even more efficient as long as you remember to make use of your common sense. However, listing your intentions isn't enough now. Don't be lazy; work hard and proudly cross each item off your list as you finish it."
gemini,2014-04-21,"You might feel as if you're out of sync with those around you today; your heart may not be into finishing the tasks currently on your plate. Meanwhile, boredom arises from being able to see farther into the future than normal, distracting you from focusing on the present moment. Thankfully, you Twins are the champions of working with duality. Keeping an eye on the horizon while simultaneously attending to your immediate responsibilities is the best thing you can do to assure your success."
cancer,2014-04-21,"You are determined to make significant progress on your long-term goals today, but you still might get sidetracked along your way. A family member or close friend may ask for your advice or present you with a serious proposition. Although saying yes probably means delaying your previous plans, it's impossible to say no because you immediately see the positive impact you can have on the project. Helping those you love is good for your soul as long as you don't forget to also take care of yourself."
leo,2014-04-21,"You may be excited to fire up the adrenaline and do something adventurous today or you might just want to kick back and relax. Either way, it's difficult to find enough time in the day. There are serious concerns putting pressure on you now, unfinished chores needing your attention and unfulfilled promises that must be kept. It's isn't a competition to see how much stress you can handle; instead, it's about learning to calm the energy from the inside out. No matter how busy you are now, remember to keep shining your radiant light."
virgo,2014-04-21,"You have had to learn tough lessons about self-restraint over the past few years, but, thankfully, your days of retreat could finally be over. Just remember that the most enduring progress takes time; it's not a smart idea to jump ahead too quickly. You may envision ingenious shortcuts to success, but your accomplishments are more sustainable if you let cautious optimism be your guide. Remember, this isn't about instant fame or fortune, so take the long methodical approach now for the best results."
libra,2014-04-21,"You won't be able to have as much fun as you wish if you have let too many domestic chores pile up everywhere you look. Even if you have a lot of weight on your shoulders now, your positive attitude makes a huge difference. Remember, you could work yourself up into a state of frustration if you choose to ignore your feelings. Simply acknowledging your resistance to doing your work helps to release your tension so you can focus on finishing your responsibilities before heading out to play."
scorpio,2014-04-21,"Sometimes you don't mind simply going along with the unfolding energy of the day, wherever it takes you. But today you may struggle with your resistance to change; even if it's wiser to modify your plans, you might not want to abandon your previous agenda. Prioritize those things you need to accomplish, but don't be afraid to shift the order or move on to the next item if that makes more sense. Remember, you can return later to complete whatever you didn't finish. Your willingness to make adjustments on the fly is your secret weapon now."
sagittarius,2014-04-21,"You might find yourself dealing with an unexpected financial problem today, but it's not likely to be as big a deal as it currently seems. It may even be something as simple as forgetting to pay a bill and you should be able to quickly remedy the situation by conscientiously attending to the matter. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to let a little glitch go unchecked or it will probably grow into something more serious. A stitch in time saves nine."
capricorn,2014-04-21,"You could be uncharacteristically sensitive with the emotional Moon back in your sign, which can add to your overall moodiness today. However, denying your feelings might create more stress than simply sharing what's in your heart in the moment. There's really no need to control how anyone reacts; just make sure to give them a chance to express their feelings, too. It's not about forcing any particular outcome now; engage in an open and honest conversation with as few expectations as possible."
aquarius,2014-04-21,"You are tempted to keep a significant piece of information to yourself now, especially since the reflective Moon is visiting your 12th House of Secrets. However, your reticence to share what's on your mind could stir up suspicions in someone around you. Ultimately, it's smarter to be straightforward and tell the truth today. Whatever you withhold will still come out into the open soon enough, and when it does it might create even more trouble. There's no question about it; honesty really is the best policy if you want to take the high road and walk a spiritual path."
pisces,2014-04-21,"Your friends ride to your rescue with flying colors today as long as you don't secretly harbor unrealistic expectations. Thankfully, the calculating Capricorn Moon is visiting your 11th House of Community, keeping social interactions on a very practical level. Maintain a sensible perspective on all your relationships now since it's a lot easier to reach your goals when you have the support from those around you. Count your blessings; it's a gift having people in your life that come through when it truly matters."
aries,2014-04-22,"Someone's big ideas seem totally outrageous today, even if you enjoy living dangerously. You might try to take the easy way out and simply sweep the problem under the rug by moving on to another conversation. However, there's no way you can sidestep a confrontation now. Demonstrate your courage by facing your denial and pushing the issues out into the open. Things might be bumpy at first, but a straightforward approach assures you of the best chances of success."
taurus,2014-04-22,"You might find yourself going along for the ride at work now, even if you aren't in full agreement with the direction. You realize that you could argue your case, but your good will is more effective in the long run than fighting against the consensus of the group. Relax; letting someone else take the lead for a while isn't a permanent change. Show your team spirit by supporting your coworkers the best you can. Your sense of loyalty and willingness to compromise won't go unrewarded."
gemini,2014-04-22,"Your ideas sound great to everyone at first, but their resistance may increase once someone points out that you've overlooked an important detail. You might not be able to get off the hook today as easily as you wish since you will be held accountable for your actions. Thankfully, your mental clarity returns and works in your favor, but concrete results could take a few days to manifest. Keep in mind that there's no need to be in such a hurry. This detour is a blessing in disguise; seize the opportunity to fine-tune your strategy."
cancer,2014-04-22,"Chaotic circumstances at work now make it harder than ever to focus on your job. Nevertheless, you believe that you know what is valuable and what is a drain on your energy. However, if you must take a stand, at least be sure that you're not turning an unimportant detail into a big deal. Once you actually decide to go ahead with your plan, don't allow anything to distract you. Your confidence, commitment and determination make an unbeatable combination."
leo,2014-04-22,"Overcoming a few small obstacles that stand in the path between you and your happiness now is not going to be as simple as it seems. In fact, your faith in your abilities may be greater than the situation warrants. Carefully consider what you want to say and do prior to taking such bold action. Even if you don't feel like explaining your motives today, practicing a little humility and diplomacy can go a long way to enlisting others in your cause."
virgo,2014-04-22,"Your day starts off innocently enough, but the energy grows more convoluted by the afternoon. You understand that part of your job now is to sort out the meaningful messages from the increasing amount of noise. Unfortunately, you might feel as if there's no place to hide when the pace quickens. But don't cut yourself off from the action because there are gems of potential in the mix if you have the courage to search for them. Step outside of your comfort zone to manifest your dreams."
libra,2014-04-22,"It may be futile to attempt to keep anything secret today because, strangely enough, everyone already seems to know what's going on in your life. The good news is the magnifying lens will only be focused on you for a couple of days. The intensity will fade but your life might never be quite the same as it was before. In the meantime, live in the present moment and simply deal with each surprise as it arrives. Paradoxically, embracing the unknown is your surest route to success."
scorpio,2014-04-22,"Even if you feel like you're at the end of your rope today, there's really no cause for immediate alarm. The apparent finality is just an illusion to push you into motion. However, the danger is that you may be so emotionally charged that you overcompensate and do too much. Let your heightened anxiety move you off dead center and stir you to action, but don't overreact or you might be back to the drawing board all too quickly. A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."
sagittarius,2014-04-22,"This can be a grand day for you Archers as action-hero Mars fires up your key planet Jupiter. You may start your day with inflated expectations only to suddenly discover that they are out of place. Don't give your discouragement a warm enough reception that it wants to stick around all day. Just relegate your visions of the future to your inner world where you are entirely free to wander wherever you want. No matter what, keep your dreams alive."
capricorn,2014-04-22,"You have a promising opportunity to make progress today, but you must face an intense issue head on. Others respect your willingness to work hard, but you mustn't assume a superior attitude now, even if that's how you feel. You are already running a marathon of sorts, and your responsibilities require you to stay on the straight and narrow path even if there are a few wonderful distractions beckoning along the way. Focusing on the finish line enhances your chances of winning the race."
aquarius,2014-04-22,"Although you're better known for fostering independence in those you love, you may need to practice your nurturing skills to care for someone special today. Your close proximity with emotional interdependence can raise a bit of discomfort now because it puts you directly in touch with your own feelings. Whatever you do, don't try to rationalize them away. Luckily, tending to your eclectic needs is still possible while you come through with the goodies for others. Take a chance and open the door to your heart."
pisces,2014-04-22,"You can feel the stress in a relationship today and you want to share your solution for putting everything back in harmony. The only safe way out of this unstable situation is to deflate it before it explodes. Remember, you played an active role in creating the present dynamics and now you need to participate in making it right. Think of your current challenge as an adventure. You're on the metaphysical bomb squad and have been sent in to defuse the scene of the crime. If you remain calm, cool and compassionate, you could emerge as the hero who saves the day."
aries,2014-04-23,"Your world is full of invisible fuses today and you are carrying a lit propane torch. You might be concerned about making it through the day without accidentally setting off an unwanted display of emotional fireworks. A personal meltdown may be inevitable now, so don't waste your energy trying to sidestep the conflict. If you must express your feelings, at least do whatever you can to minimize the collateral damage."
taurus,2014-04-23,"You might feel uneasy as you attempt to suppress your intense emotions; however, this strategy of denial won't take you very far today. There is simply too much at stake and you may have to defend your values at some point. But don't get sucked into dramas that aren't yours; keep bringing the conversation back to the most fundamental issues so you can make your point. Your brilliant originality combines with your sheer determination now to make you an unstoppable force of nature."
gemini,2014-04-23,"You're eager to make your move today, but you might need to modify your tactics because of changing circumstances. However, your ruling planet Mercury steps into steady Taurus this morning, giving you an unflappable sense of certainty over the next couple of weeks. Keeping an open mind is critical now because rigid thinking could cause you to freeze up. Practice deep breathing, peaceful meditation or anything else that soothes your frazzled nerves and resonates with your heart. Adapting quickly to the new landscape increases your chances for success."
cancer,2014-04-23,"Your colorful imagination is flowing strong today, making it difficult to navigate the shifting emotional tides of reality. Even if you're not completely ready for the transition, additional preparation might not change the outcome anyhow. Don't exhaust yourself struggling to hang on to things you no longer need. Let go and the past will lose its grip on your future. The sooner you overcome your fear and trust the process of transformation the better."
leo,2014-04-23,"You feel at peace with your action plan, but some things aren't clear if the rules of the game suddenly change. Someone unexpectedly might turn against you today. Or, perhaps the level of intensity just heats up more than you expected. One way or another, this shocking energy shift requires you to alter your direction. Flexibility is your secret weapon now, since you can't control the powers being unleashed. Your brilliance can shine through if you are willing to be like the willow tree and bend in the wind."
virgo,2014-04-23,"Unexpected disruptions at work can create surprising opportunities to show your hidden talents. You are ready to take charge in order to put your schedule back on track, but you must work with others to make everything happen on time. Remember that cooperation is your current key to success. Even if people seem to block your efforts now, don't exclude them from your plans. Instead, incorporating the contributions from your friends helps you reach your destination sooner than you expected."
libra,2014-04-23,"It's time for all you good-natured Libras to take off your velvet gloves and fight to express your individuality. Don't make the mistake of simply acquiescing to the pressure of authority today without a good reason. Instead of relying on other people to represent your position, take responsibility for defending yourself. Owning your power isn't easy when you are used to being a team player, but ultimately, it will be much more personally satisfying if you stand up to anyone who isn't respectful of your feelings."
scorpio,2014-04-23,"You're not in the mood to be pushed around today; you have been stretched to your limit, and the slightest provocation might trigger your swift response. Combative Mars squares fierce Pluto and opposes unpredictable Uranus, releasing buried feelings and creating more drama than you intended. To make the best use of the electricity in the air, channel your intensity into creative endeavors or physical exertion. Misdirected energy can be problematic now, but you are unbeatable when your actions align with your heart."
sagittarius,2014-04-23,"Even if you try to keep your feelings to yourself today, your preferences still might leak out and create a bit of a ruckus. Your friends and associates may assume you're purposefully pushing their buttons, but this isn't your objective. You just want everyone to understand your perspective and are tempted to pressure others to make your point. However, a gentle approach can turn an adversary into a supporter. There's no reason to alienate your allies in order to be true to yourself."
capricorn,2014-04-23,"You're not interested in revealing your feelings unless there is a purpose for the display. However, your need to express your opinions may be compelling enough now that you will do so, even if it's counterproductive. Although you probably know what's best, you still might go out of your way to give someone a piece of your mind. Don't judge yourself too harshly if you take the situation too seriously. Simply apologize for your behavior if necessary, and focus on creating positive change in the present moment."
aquarius,2014-04-23,"Although you may sound quite brilliant today, your innovative ideas turn into unnecessary ultimatums if you don't know when to stop. Don't try to convince anyone that you have all the answers now; just state your truth and then back off. Let your words strike like lightning since they might even bring a much-needed shock of awareness to others. Your message will have greater resonance with those you're trying to reach if you come from a place of  sincerity."
pisces,2014-04-23,"Your tumultuous feelings cross over into public domain today where they have the potential to upset someone who is in the vicinity. It's not that your emotions are so outrageous; it's just that others may be caught off guard by the sudden intensity of your rebellion, even if your behavior doesn't seem that radical to you. Although you're doing the right thing by expressing your heart, don't burn any bridges behind you unless you have no intent of ever returning. Cultivate your compassion while still honoring your truth."
aries,2014-04-24,"Communicating your point of view seems like a clever tactic until someone steps forward with a conflicting opinion. It's only natural to try to convince others that your interpretation of the facts is the correct one. Unfortunately, you may not be the only person willing to fight to make a point. Rather than wasting energy defending your position today, use this interaction as a unique opportunity for growth. However, in order for this strategy to work, you must remain open to ideas different from your own."
taurus,2014-04-24,"You're quite capable of holding your ground while defending the importance of your dreams today, prompting others to acknowledge that you have the right to decide your own destiny. Thankfully, your associates are likely to support your goals because they are eager to be on a winning team. However, it's not smart to abuse your power. You won't be able to keep your following if your actions originate in selfish desires. Fortunately, you can go far if you are smart enough to work toward the common good."
gemini,2014-04-24,"Your imagination is tapping into the rich archetypal symbols of your subconscious today. You can receive guidance from vivid images that pop into your awareness, but this isn't just a distracting mental exercise. Your visions motivate you to act on your intuitive feelings now, instead of on rational thoughts. Don't try to filter or suppress your fantasies; allow them to bypass your head and directly touch your heart."
cancer,2014-04-24,"You can see the road ahead clearly and are someone that everyone depends on because of your solid sense of direction. Ironically, you're relying on your instincts to know exactly where you are and how to get where you are going. However, you need to pay attention to the subtle changes today since everything seems to be moving so fast. Update others with the details often so everyone feels included in the process. Lead by example and keep the channels of communication wide open."
leo,2014-04-24,"You could waste precious time today with your incessant chatter about a current problem at work. Even if you're brainstorming ideas or offering a workable solution, others may not be listening all that closely now. Although your friends usually value your opinion, they're tired of all talk and no results. Do more and say less; actions speak louder than words."
virgo,2014-04-24,"Visualizing your future is easier if you stop intellectualizing every piece of the puzzle. Your world suddenly turns brighter when you simply trust your intuition. Although your senses are usually very sharp, you have a much wider range of perceptions today. Experiences that may have been beyond your awareness only yesterday are now beckoning you into new territory. Enjoy this journey of personal growth; metamorphosis is safer than you think and the results can be amazing."
libra,2014-04-24,"You might feel as if other people are being pushier than necessary, but it may not disturb you so much today if you have recently found the courage to stand up for yourself. Start with a basic fact and work from there because it's crucial to build your vision on a stable foundation. Your unshakable conviction is your secret weapon now; if you're in tune with your own purpose, then no one can come between you and your soul's destiny."
scorpio,2014-04-24,"You may choose to move forward on a project at work today with relentless intensity. Thankfully, the certainty that currently arises from accepting your responsibilities can be reassuring. However, acquiescing to your fate isn't about being powerless; it's your destiny to create the waves upon which you are surfing. You are a force to be reckoned with now, so go out of your way to make something memorable happen while you have the chance."
sagittarius,2014-04-24,"Your insecurities could catch up with you today as you worry about your job performance or a power imbalance in a relationship. But instead of digging yourself into an emotional hole, you can lift your spirits back up into an optimistic place by simply imagining that everything is copacetic. Paradoxically, your best fantasies now are fueled with concrete information. Don't waste any time; getting your facts in order is your first step to cultivating new dreams."
capricorn,2014-04-24,"Your ambitious nature might get the best of you today if you scare your associates with your serious demeanor and your unrelenting commitment to getting the job done. But people might not realize how grounded you are because your passions are close to the surface now. Fortunately, you can express your feelings and back them up with practical action regardless of what others think. You don't need to justify your plans but you may want to reconsider your priorities one last time. Your professional drive is admirable, but don't lose your heart connection with others in your rush to success."
aquarius,2014-04-24,"You have a rare opportunity to share your opinions about a very delicate matter today without stirring up much trouble. If you received a mixed reception when you recently went on a rant with your radical ideas, you now have a chance to try again with a different audience. Make certain that you present your conclusions logically without attacking anyone's values. Respecting the views of others encourages them to give your ideas a fair chance."
pisces,2014-04-24,"Your friends rush to your assistance today and help you in ways that money can't buy. You might not even have to ask, yet others may jump in to lend a hand with the physical labor or stick up for you in a fight. Thankfully, your closest allies speak the truth, even if it isn't what you want to hear. You can always go out and hire someone to do your chores; however, it's a real gift when you receive honest and intelligent feedback from someone that you trust."
aries,2014-04-25,"Sometimes too much structure in your personal relationships makes you nervous, since you treasure your independence. But the cosmic weather encourages you to make a commitment without fear of being tied down today. Maybe a current relationship really is different from others in your past. Or, perhaps you have changed. However, it's possible that you're misleading yourself because the power struggles have not yet surfaced. Nevertheless, don't run away; stay with your feelings. Time will reveal the truth."
taurus,2014-04-25,"Your inner voice may be telling you to cool your heels today and it would be wise to take heed. Although this feeling of uncertainty will pass, the reality of your current experience will outlast this moment and it will be clear which course of action is best for you. However, if you see the possibility of developing a healthy relationship in the future, do what you can to keep the energy alive until you decide where it's heading."
gemini,2014-04-25,"Although you're more in touch with your artistic nature these days, it's not easy to express what's in your imagination now. You're feeling a mental buzz from trying to integrate recent realizations; however, it's time to move out of your head and into your body. Treat yourself to sensual activities such as a massage, a gourmet meal or an evening of music; anything to ground and relax you fits the bill. Sensations come and go, but your experiences become fuel for your creative expression later on."
cancer,2014-04-25,"You may have unsettled feelings that won't go away today, even though you see signs that make you believe you can trust your instincts. Your anxiety is worrisome, especially when your intuition contradicts logical thought. Even if you want additional corroboration from the universe, you really shouldn't wait to make your move. Your moment is here; proceed with love in your heart and you just might succeed beyond your wildest dreams."
leo,2014-04-25,"Maybe you know things today that others do not. Or, perhaps you're just afraid of being controlled by someone else's agenda. No matter what has you hot and bothered now, it's crucial to stay as rational as possible. Observe what is occurring in your immediate environment as objectively as possible and listen to what others are saying. Once you have done enough research, act in accordance with what you know rather than what you fabricate from your fears. You may be pleasantly surprised by how smoothly things progress when your behavior is aligned with the truth."
virgo,2014-04-25,"Although your intuition is working overtime today, it could raise unrealistic concerns over little things that, in the long run, won't even matter. But it's not a simple task to separate the valid worries from the imagined ones. This is your current dilemma; there are no quick and easy answers. Nevertheless, a solution is closer than you think. For a change, trust the feelings of your heart and not the thoughts of your head. Satisfaction can be yours if you continue to move sensibly toward that which makes you smile."
libra,2014-04-25,"Your weekend begins with a healthy dose of cosmic restraint. Even your most grandiose schemes and visions take on an air of sensibility today as your key planet Venus trines pragmatic Saturn. This is a great time to convert your ideas into concrete plans, but first bring your high-flying desires down a level or two so they can become more real. Methodical action aimed at a very specific goal just might bring you the rewards you seek. Blending the practical and the magical leads you on a path to success."
scorpio,2014-04-25,"Showing up in the outer world is what counts today, rather than following your never-ending attraction to the mysteries of the universe. It's not that your spiritual quest is any less important now; it's just that reality is placing very real demands on you that can't be ignored. Ultimately, even your work reflects back onto your inner life. Just take care of business and your efforts will come full circle later on. Demonstrate your integrity by delivering on your promises on time."
sagittarius,2014-04-25,"The most important thing you can get from others now is an honest reflection of your own feelings. It's not necessary to focus on specific issues or work to change the circumstances in your life today. Instead, take time to examine how you present yourself to the outer world through your everyday actions. Share your concerns with those closest to you because they're the ones who will help you clarify what ultimately matters most to your heart."
capricorn,2014-04-25,"You have a chance to find the love and affection you seek now that your key planet Saturn is creating a yummy trine with pleasurable Venus. You're not interested in receiving short-lived gratification or in making a quick buck today. Since Venus symbolizes all things of value, you may have a chance to solidify a big deal -- one that can bring you financial reward or professional recognition. Just remember to allow room for transformations to occur, no matter how certain your current agenda seems."
aquarius,2014-04-25,"There is an unusual balance of energy today between holding on to what you desire and simply being open to the sweetness of the moment. There is a lovely opportunity afoot when Venus, the Goddess of Pleasure, and Saturn, the God of Restriction, are in total agreement. Luckily, you might be able to have your cake and eat it too if you simultaneously maintain your current position while charting new territory. Magical thinking opens doors to new possibilities."
pisces,2014-04-25,"You may be quite willing to sacrifice your own personal needs for the good of your tribe or community today, but it doesn't help the cause if you set yourself up to play the role of a martyr or a victim. Be a compassionate participant while continuing to take good care of yourself. One doesn't preclude the other. By making a sincere effort to balance your life in this manner, you won't feel as depleted and there will be more of your positive energy to go around."
aries,2014-04-26,"You can feel the excitement in the air now that the evocative Moon is back in your sign. Instead of seeing obstacles today, you only see possibilities everywhere you look. Rather than worrying about the hard work ahead, you're busy visualizing your destination as if you have already arrived. However, there is one tiny problem: your current tendency to avoid the details in life might quickly land you in a heap of trouble. Prevent problems by slowing down and thinking before you act. A proactive approach enables you to reach your destination."
taurus,2014-04-26,"Although the end of the race may be in sight now, you know better than to break out in an unrestrained sprint. Fortunately, your instincts serve you well because a trick of light might turn the finish line into appearing much closer than it actually is. However, there's no reason to be discouraged today; just set a pace that you can keep up for a while because your marathon isn't quite over yet. Slow and steady wins the race."
gemini,2014-04-26,"Someone might place you up on a pedestal today, but it's not a good idea to buy into this false superiority. Rather than seeing yourself as the alpha dog, let go of the attachments you have to being in control. Your experience is more satisfying if you are a willing participant in a group activity than if you fight to be in charge. Sharing responsibility now is your best strategy for success. You earn more followers when you lead by example."
cancer,2014-04-26,"You aren't happy about being forced out of your shell, but you have a job to do now that others are looking to you for guidance and expecting you to share your wisdom. Still, you're reluctant to push your ideas onto someone else and might wish that you didn't have to take on new responsibilities today. However, once you get going, it feels exhilarating to be in charge. Thankfully, your current service will be rewarded if you don't get carried away with your own power."
leo,2014-04-26,"Success is yours today if only you can strike a workable balance between your big plans and the actual limitations of the current circumstances. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to be so enthusiastic about your brilliant ideas that you spread resources too thin and ultimately fall short of everyone's expectations. Even if you have high hopes, you accomplish more by moderating your ambitions. Make quality, not quantity, your primary goal."
virgo,2014-04-26,"All kinds of partnerships continue to be a major focus now, but the dynamics of a current relationship are growing more complex as the balance of power begins to shift. You may be so enamored with the potential of working with such an optimistic person that you give up more control than is necessary. Or, perhaps, you are too quick to trust someone who hasn't yet earned your respect. Opportunities abound, but don't forget to use your common sense when choosing which ones to pursue."
libra,2014-04-26,"Someone may come along with an intriguing idea and a convincing sales pitch today. However, you could be so eager for an adventure that you say yes before you even know the details. Keep in mind that you are more susceptible now to a story that's built on big dreams and blue sky. Check your facts twice before jumping on the bandwagon, or you might waste time running down a dream that isn't even yours."
scorpio,2014-04-26,"You may have experienced a recent break in your regular routine. Now, however, you're eager to get back into the swing of things and reestablish your daily regimen. But instead of repeating your old pattern of chasing deadlines, take a long hard look at the opportunity you have to change the rules of the game so you can actually get ahead of the curve. You have more power than you realize and it just might be time to flex your muscles."
sagittarius,2014-04-26,"It's no fun trying to contain your enthusiasm as the Moon dashes into impulsive Aries and your 5th House of Creativity. You don't want to wait for the traffic light to change from red to green; you're ready to hit the gas pedal right now. Unfortunately, moving quickly lessens your chances for success. You have an incredible opportunity to do something significant today while also having fun. Push ahead with cautious determination instead of flying by the seat of your pants."
capricorn,2014-04-26,"You might worry that you didn't spend enough time getting ready for your next endeavor. However, wishing that you had worked harder in the past won't solve anything in the present. Consider what you can do that can have positive impact on your career right now. Remember, maintaining an upbeat attitude helps you create the solid foundation required for a stellar future."
aquarius,2014-04-26,"You probably won't have a lot of free time today because you're packing so much into your life these days. Unfortunately, you could run into a stone wall if you don't pay attention to how much energy you are expending. Don't wait for an unexpected reality check to stop you in your tracks. Preemptively slowing down not only increases your pleasure in the present moment, it also enables you to accomplish more than you thought possible."
pisces,2014-04-26,"You may expect a change of pace once the sensitive Moon leaves intuitive Pisces this morning. However, your imagination still rules the roost because dreamy Neptune remains active all day. Nevertheless, you want to create something that lasts. But don't make the mistake of thinking that you can turn any thought into reality by simply working harder than anyone else. Exploring your fantasies now opens the door to a whole new world."
aries,2014-04-27,"You are buzzing with energy today and you might be so distracted with what you're doing that you don't even notice when something goes awry. Thankfully, the spontaneous Aries Moon spurs you to react quickly and effectively to each new challenge. Keeping up with all the demands of the day may be exhilarating, but it's nearly impossible to get ahead of the curve now. Ironically, the solution doesn't involve turning into a super-hero; instead, retreating into your imagination distances you from the stress in your environment and deepens your perspective."
taurus,2014-04-27,"You may still be keeping a few secrets to yourself, but you might have an opportunity to gain someone's confidence now by sharing something you know. You're projecting a magical and charming side of yourself today, which can help you obtain what you want. But don't misuse your power of persuasion or things could backfire. Following the moral high road gets you to your destination faster than taking a shortcut."
gemini,2014-04-27,"Watch what you say today because others are likely to take your words at face value. The potential for misunderstanding is complicated by your current tendency to flourish the facts with extraneous pieces of information, especially if you stretch the truth a bit. Your colorful daydreams are entertaining, but you're better off sticking to the real world now when you're sharing your stories so you don't give anyone the wrong idea. Build relationships on reality, not fantasy."
cancer,2014-04-27,"Although your relationships are a significant part of your life, they must take a temporary backseat to your own goals today. Nevertheless, you still have to find a sensible way to balance other people's desires with your urgent need to redefine your own path. You may be tempted to act impulsively, but a sudden change of direction could be more destabilizing than liberating. Entertain all possibilities as you envision the future, but reserve your final decision until the current excitement settles down. In the meantime, consider the emotional cost of following your heart."
leo,2014-04-27,"You have an extra bounce in your step as you imagine your next exciting adventure. Nevertheless, you still might have to revisit an all-too-familiar issue today. If you bump into any resistance, don't try to just force it out of the way. Instead, take time to learn the lesson being offered. If you can grasp the real message now, obstacles will fall to the wayside. Seeing everything as an expression of a deeper purpose adds a bit of magic to your day."
virgo,2014-04-27,"Charging full force into your day may not be the best use of your active imagination. You're in the midst of an extremely busy time and the more structure you build into your calendar, the more time you will have to indulge in your fantasies. You might not be able to sidestep your responsibilities today, but making plans in advance allows you to be more efficient. Thankfully, taking a proactive approach to scheduling allows you to still pursue your dreams."
libra,2014-04-27,"A recurring issue about finding time for your own needs may resurface today. Naturally, you want to make your partner happy, but always focusing on someone else can eventually leave you feeling depleted. Ultimately, you have more to give a loved one when you also take care of yourself. There's no reason to downplay what you really want. Confront your fear of rejection; asking for your heart's desire now could surprisingly lead to fulfillment."
scorpio,2014-04-27,"Keeping your needs quiet now is particularly difficult, but expressing them in a direct and forceful manner won't necessarily get you what you want either. Unfortunately, attempts to keep your feelings tightly under wraps while waiting for a more opportune moment probably won't work today. Even if you understand the power of right timing, circumstances may unravel just enough to motivate you into action. You might be better off if you just go ahead and put your desires out on the table without having too many expectations. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
sagittarius,2014-04-27,"Your self-confidence is on the rise now, but it's still not wise to push too hard for what you want. You might not realize how much persuasive power you have packed into your actions now; even with the best of intentions, you can offend your most supportive allies by coming on too strong. Thankfully, you don't have to convince anyone to join you. Just stay true to your dreams; when you're in tune with your soul's purpose, everything else should fall into place."
capricorn,2014-04-27,"Although the cosmos might command you to loosen up today, it's not easy for you to let go completely. You think you have way too much at stake today to just sit back and go with the flow. You would feel better if you were controlling the currents, but don't delude yourself into a false sense of power. You may be strong, but it's pointless to waste your energy on things you cannot change. Even if it seems counter-intuitive, your best strategy is to relax and float downstream for a while. There will be enough time tomorrow to regain control and reclaim lost ground."
aquarius,2014-04-27,"You certainly won't grow bored today. In fact, you could be a whole lot busier than you prefer. Thankfully, you have a deep reserve of energy now, and are eager to fully engage nearly anything that is thrown at you. Your passion drives you to start a major project that you've been contemplating for a while. This is a call to action from the universe, but don't be too impractical in your response. Although it's not necessary to have all the details penciled in yet, you do need to have rough plans in hand before you can start construction."
pisces,2014-04-27,This is a very magical day for you Fishes because you can be in the world and not in it at the very same time. You naturally live within a context of an incredibly vivid fantasy life. It's crucial to honor your imagination because it adds meaning to your spiritual quest. Aligning your outer life with your inner realms goes a long way now toward creating harmony. Make the most of this equilibrium while it lasts.
aries,2014-04-28,"The excitement begins to fade today leaving you with mixed feelings. Naturally, you're relieved because you can finally relax, but you're also sad to experience a break in the action. However, there's no reason to be concerned about losing your connection to the buzz since the momentum will return sooner than you think. In the meantime, take advantage of the calm by doing something special to recharge your system. Your renewed vitality enables your superpowers to operate at their optimal best."
taurus,2014-04-28,"Although this might be a back-to-work day for you, it could also bring a strong urge to escape from responsibility. Thankfully, you may be able to steal some time to relax, even if you still need to show up for your job. Your coworkers could think that you're being aloof, but they don't necessarily understand how you Bulls process your emotions. Just let others know that you need some personal space so you can contemplate your future without interruption. Integrate your feelings through meditation and active daydreaming before doing anything drastic."
gemini,2014-04-28,"You can be insistent about your needs today as your key planet Mercury anxiously aligns with assertive Mars. But it's nearly impossible to correctly gauge the amount of energy you should put into your negotiation. You may end up feeling like you come on too strong or not strong enough. Although the Goldilocks ""just right"" amount is elusive, your ability to find that sweet spot will return tomorrow, along with your certainty. In the meantime, let your natural flexibility lead the way as you make adjustments to your message throughout the day."
cancer,2014-04-28,"You might have the inclination to socialize with your coworkers today for no other reason than to discuss your career objectives and your goals for the future. However, expressing your vision of an ideal life is no substitute for making something tangible happen in the here and now. Nevertheless, expressing your ideas in a non-judgmental environment reminds you of what is really important. Just remember, sharing is a two-way street; listening to the dreams of others can inspire you to follow your bliss."
leo,2014-04-28,"You may be running around in vicious circles today, arguing with yourself about how to balance your needs with your responsibilities. Unfortunately, your spontaneity is constrained by previous commitments that could limit your freedom. Nevertheless, you know exactly what you must do, even while considering a quick escape. Being practical is your smartest strategy now, since you will have plenty of time for guilt-free play later in the week."
virgo,2014-04-28,"You most likely spend your time tying up as many loose ends as possible today while you can maintain a steady pace. You're most productive when following your instincts now, so you might have to ignore anyone who tells you to work faster. Thankfully, it's easy to defend your integrity from someone's accusatory attacks. Don't be afraid to take a firm stand on an important issue, but try not to offend others in the process. You exude a quiet sense of authority when you let your actions do the talking."
libra,2014-04-28,"An easygoing relationship may grow more intense as feelings sink beneath the surface. Although you aren't afraid of describing your emotions in a straightforward manner today, your communication style could clash with someone else's approach. Hold your ground; go ahead and explain your position the best you can, but stop talking once you have made your point. Don't be overly impatient; reaching closure might take longer than you think. Listen as much as you speak."
scorpio,2014-04-28,"You can't understand why your coworkers don't seem to follow through on their promises today. You might try to be more forgiving, but someone can get on your nerves, provoking you to intervene. However, throwing a tantrum won't accomplish anything worthwhile. You can't make anyone else change unless they are willing to do so on their own terms. Engaging in an endless debate won't lead to conflict resolution now. Instead, just accept responsibility for your own emotional response to the situation and then simply let it go."
sagittarius,2014-04-28,"Becoming bogged down in unnecessary details is totally annoying today, since you typically prefer to view the bigger picture in a holistic manner. Nevertheless, you can see the benefit of finding your way back to the basics in order to create a direct path through all the excitement. But don't get lost in your work. Even if you have a lot to manage now, it's still better to seek a balance between your adventurous spirit and your current single-minded ambition."
capricorn,2014-04-28,"Sometimes being a conscientious Mountain Goat has its distinct advantages. If you have been acting in a responsible manner all along, you get to play now while others still have to work. However, your associates may be jealous, especially if they still have unfinished chores that infringe on their ability to have fun. But you're not perfect either and today you might uncover a task you thought you had already completed. Don't let something minor spoil your day; it's healthier to kick up your heels while you can."
aquarius,2014-04-28,"You have unfulfilled personal obligations that you might not want to address today. However, you also realize that procrastinating only delays everything else you need to do, too. Overcome your unnecessary resistance by acknowledging the importance of your home and family. It may not be easy to initiate action now, but you should feel more positive about your life once you see that you're making real progress. Take a moment to reshuffle your priorities and then get to work."
pisces,2014-04-28,"You might not want to change the plans you already have in place for the week ahead. Although your uncharacteristic stubbornness could work in your favor by helping you to be more productive now, attempting to adhere to your previous agenda may grow increasingly stressful. Practicing flexibility helps to move the energy in the right direction. With just a little extra effort on your part today, you could turn a challenge into an opportunity to make a real difference."
aries,2014-04-29,"You must become more practical now by leaving the preparatory phase of a project and entering into the building phase. The Taurus New Moon Eclipse rattles your 2nd House of Self-Worth, forcing you to focus on producing tangible results and letting go of your unrealistic ideas. But you don't have to perform miracles overnight. Even a little bit of progress today gets you heading in the right direction and gives you a foundation on which to create enduring success."
taurus,2014-04-29,"You are at the edge of a magical initiation that can lead you in an entirely new direction. Today's Solar Eclipse falls in your sign, shocking you with a fresh array of feelings and requiring you to react with integrity. However, you must proceed cautiously because your mind is running ahead of your actions now. Thankfully, as long as you don't get caught up in your own whirlwind of thoughts, you should be able to turn your best ideas into reality."
gemini,2014-04-29,"Something isn't as it seems today, since the Taurus New Moon Eclipse emphasizes your 12th House of Secrets. Significant pieces of the puzzle may still be missing from your big picture, making your perspective incomplete until you unearth the additional data. Take everything that happens without an apparent reason as a clue now. Following the mysteries without knowing where you're going can lead you on a circuitous route into uncertainty. Have faith; there are treasures lurking in the shadows if you have the courage to look."
cancer,2014-04-29,"Although others can help you stay on task, don't just blindly follow all the advice that is offered to you today. Luckily, your friends may be the source of valuable guidance now that the pragmatic Taurus Solar Eclipse shadows your 11th House of Social Networks. You are at a fork in the road; once you pass this point you won't be able to circle back and make a second choice. Give yourself plenty of time to consider the consequences of your current decision before you commit to any one direction."
leo,2014-04-29,"You might feel as if someone is rapidly flipping the switch of the spotlight that's shining on your career today. The strobe effect is shocking and the Taurus Solar Eclipse in your 10th House of Public Status casts a whole new perspective on your professional path. Luckily, you can make choices that positively alter your long-term goals if you are thinking ahead of the curve. But don't spend too much time lost in thought. Planning time is over; get busy and manifest your dreams."
virgo,2014-04-29,"Applying the energy of today's Taurus New Moon Eclipse empowers you to make pragmatic plans for your future. However, its emphasis on your 9th House of Adventure also suggests you could be planning a weekend getaway. Or, perhaps you are dreaming about turning your life upside-down by moving to a foreign country or embarking on a spiritual journey. Nearly anything is possible now if you remember to proceed slowly through the changes with careful deliberation. If it's worth doing, it's also worth taking the time to do it right."
libra,2014-04-29,"Exploring ways to experience new pleasures takes center stage now that the earthy Taurus New Moon Eclipse highlights your 8th House of Intimacy. Nevertheless, attending to your priorities while also leaving time to indulge in sensual delights such as delicious food, soulful music or relaxing massage is tricky. You don't have the luxury of simply idling the day away; you must also be proactive to get the most out of this moment. Carefully consider what you want on your path of life, for whatever choices you make today could have a powerful impact on your future."
scorpio,2014-04-29,"Relationship stability is a double-edged sword now. You like the emotional security, but too much safety can make you complacent. One way to raise the stakes is to create a ritual with a close friend or partner since the powerful Taurus Solar Eclipse sets the stage for metaphysical magic in your 7th House of Companions. Try something as simple as lighting candles and giving voice to your intentions for the month ahead. Whatever you choose to do today, just be sure that everything is done with conscious purpose."
sagittarius,2014-04-29,This is a great time to handle any health concerns now that the physical Taurus New Moon lands in your 6th House of Self-Improvement. Make an appointment if you are due for your yearly exam or are overdue for a dental checkup. Set aside a bit of time now to reevaluate your diet and exercise program. Examine how you can improve you wellbeing by making small changes in your daily regimen that stand up to the tests of time. Living a life of adventure demands that you take excellent care of your body.
capricorn,2014-04-29,"If you recently had trouble finding time to relax, play or pursue a romance, a change of schedule marks the beginning of a new phase. It's not likely that something magical will just happen to you now; you must be the one who initiates the action. Fortunately, the Taurus Solar Eclipse rocks your 5th House of Self-Expression, encouraging your spontaneity these days, whether it's about indulging your inner-child, exploring your creativity or shining your love light. Relentlessly chase your dreams if you want them to become real."
aquarius,2014-04-29,"You must face very basic issues today, such as what price you're willing to pay for the emotional security you receive from your home and family. This is a time of profound soul-searching; however, it's not constructive to just wander around in the memories of your childhood, lost in the recesses of your subconscious mind. Oddly enough, revisiting your past can help you decide what you want in your future now that the Taurus New Moon Eclipse activates your 4th House of Roots. Breaking unconscious patterns makes your relationships healthier in the long run."
pisces,2014-04-29,"The pace of your daily rhythm is speeding up again, even if your life is already busy. But even with the additional distractions, you can still make your ideas very clear to others in a way that they quickly understand. The Taurus New Moon Eclipse stimulates your noisy 3rd House of Communication, initiating a highly active and interactive month ahead. There's no time to nostalgically reminisce about the way things were. Jump into the data stream, share what's on your mind and don't miss any opportunities that come your way."
aries,2014-04-30,"Life may get strange today because you can tell something is cooking behind whatever you can perceive. You feel waves of positive energy arriving in the form of interesting people, but could grow disappointed if you're too distracted to make a real heart connection. It's great that there's so much happening, but you don't have to let your excitement stand in the way of having a more profound interaction. The choice is yours; run off to the next distraction or stick around and sink into a deeper level of intensity."
taurus,2014-04-30,"Although you may have a flurry of intriguing ideas today, don't attempt to follow up on every one of them. Instead, choose the best one and work to make it real. If you don't consciously limit your scope of vision, you might end up wasting your efforts by scattering them. Instead of jumping from one thought to the next, keep coming back to build another layer on the foundation you already have started."
gemini,2014-04-30,"The Moon's return to your sign this afternoon helps clear the muddy waters of your desires. Your understanding of what you want is growing sharper now by the hour. However, your current hypersensitivity can also make you more aware of your emotional reaction to stress. Observe your changing moods without becoming attached to any one feeling. This exercise in objectivity enables you to maintain a healthier perspective so you don't make promises that you cannot keep."
cancer,2014-04-30,"You're in a contemplative mood today and there's really not much to do about it other than to discuss your feelings with trusted friends. You might realize how important it is to overcome a blockage that has been created by your fear of change. Fortunately, once you begin sharing your story, others will be able to join in and participate in your experience. The valuable feedback you receive now can inspire and comfort you on your current journey of self-discovery."
leo,2014-04-30,You're tempted to reveal a fundamental piece of your personal story today in a way that is different from your regular approach. You aren't so guarded now and would benefit by keeping your vulnerable spots accessible to make room for someone special to connect with you. Move beyond any false pride that you may still be holding and behave in a way that is true to yourself. Your complete authenticity will be reflected back to you in a way that can open up your heart even more.
virgo,2014-04-30,"Your boss might be counting on you to come up with a solution to a problem at work, but it could require some extra hours on your part. This dilemma makes it difficult to take care of your own needs, especially if your professional responsibilities have to come first for another few days. Don't waste time fretting over things you can't change. Instead of worrying about your performance, just do your best; that's all that anyone can ask from you."
libra,2014-04-30,"The fickle Moon's entry into versatile Gemini today can reveal a variety of intriguing options for you to explore. Unfortunately, you can't trip down multiple paths at the same time. Think through each possible scenario and then pick the one that is most resonant to your thoughts and feelings. But don't delay or your choice could slip back into the recesses of your mind; do something about it while the idea is still hot."
scorpio,2014-04-30,"You might feel a bit frustrated if your day starts to spin out of control. Unfortunately, even your simple interactions with others have lives of their own today and all you can do is observe your emotions as they ebb and flow. Your current situation is in flux, so don't be so hard on yourself if you can't decide what to do. Let the strange currents carry you along for a ride; you might even like where they take you."
sagittarius,2014-04-30,"Your friends could change their minds at the very last minute today which can, in turn, upset your plans. But don't waste your energy trying to make them conform to your schedule. Ultimately, you like their unusual behavior -- perhaps it even amuses you -- so there's no need to try to rein them in. Your secret weapon now is practicing universal acceptance. Allowing for every person's uniqueness reduces the tension in your life and sets the stage for further cooperation."
capricorn,2014-04-30,"Finishing any chore you start may be a challenge because you're feeling scattered today. The Moon's shift into breezy Gemini and your 6th House of Details messes with your practical approach to your daily routine. But it's not just about being distracted. If you let go of control, you can learn many different things from a variety of sources now. Remaining open to what happens is the best way to create your future."
aquarius,2014-04-30,"You're looking for ways to have fun while the flirty Gemini Moon lights up your 5th House of Pleasure. Thankfully, enjoying yourself now is easier than you think. The main problem is that planning your activities could be quite complicated. Instead of focusing on the details of your schedule, just leave your schedule as open as possible. Moving through the day with a light touch allow the complexity to pass."
pisces,2014-04-30,"Spending more time at home with your family sounds like a lovely idea now. But another part of you wants to escape into Fantasyland and leave the intense emotional interactions for another time. Unfortunately, you might not have the patience to separate fact from fancy now, making your choices more difficult. Fortunately, you don't have to pick one path over the other; just remain flexible and respond to what happens without trying to run the show."
aries,2014-05-01,"Bouncing from one thought to the next is fun today, but it's tough to complete anything that you start. Every idea that pops into your mind warrants serious attention until the next one pulls you in a different direction. Although you may not be able to eliminate the distractions now, you can modify your responses. Thankfully, if you stay aware of your tendency to wander, you could turn the day into a productive one as long as you keep bringing yourself back to your center."
taurus,2014-05-01,"Someone expects you to do something that just doesn't make sense to you now, and it's challenging to respond favorably to their requests. You often have deep energy reserves to draw upon when you have your mind set on a specific goal. But you tire easily today, especially if you secretly believe you're wasting time. Don't hide your true feelings; bringing your uncertainty out into the open is awkward at first, but makes everyone feel better in the long run."
gemini,2014-05-01,"Your dual nature is quickly apparent today as your enthusiasm fluctuates throughout the day. Although you might be comfortable with your ongoing mood swings now, others could have a harder time understanding why you are hot one moment and cold the next. Address their concerns preemptively by simply letting them know that you're still considering your options. Your honesty may be all that is necessary to clear the air."
cancer,2014-05-01,"Following a strict schedule might be the best way to keep yourself on track now; however, it could also have the exact opposite effect. If one appointment runs late, a cascading effect may cause the rest of your day to tumble out of control. Ironically, exerting too much pressure is an invitation for disaster today. A little less worry and a lot more flexibility helps to spin everything in a more positive direction."
leo,2014-05-01,"Your friends may be a welcome source of enthusiastic encouragement at first and then offer stone cold resistance just a few minutes later, forcing you to decide which extreme reaction to accept. But you might be experiencing your own dilemma, as you vacillate between impulsive and cautious feelings. When you acknowledge these forces as merely two facets of your complex personality, you will be more open to seeing how contrary aspects can peacefully coexist in yourself and others."
virgo,2014-05-01,"A personal relationship could be stressed today, leading you to accomplish less than you wish while adding another serving of anxiety onto your plate. Although you may be required to respond to the feelings of others, they don't need to become the center of your day. Let everyone else manage their own reactions for now. Do whatever intuitively feels right for you and then move on. You can care for those you love without taking responsibility for their emotions."
libra,2014-05-01,"Hanging in the balance is a classic Libra response to stress, and that's exactly what's going on for you now as you struggle to make up your mind about your goals. You may wonder if you should sign up for a new course of study or take a long overdue trip. Paradoxically, what you choose today may prove to be less significant than simply initiating some sort of action at this time. Although you must work within your current limitations, your life is on the launch pad and ready to blast off."
scorpio,2014-05-01,"Getting an early start on your routine chores is almost always a wise move, yet single-mindedly focusing on your work today is not as smart as it sounds. A very narrow band of concentration could distract you from a chance to share an amazing experience with a loved one. Practicing flexibility creates the space for something wonderful to happen. Keep your heart open: magic is everywhere you look."
sagittarius,2014-05-01,"You can learn something valuable from a friend or partner today. But you may have a difficult time listening to what people want now, because their needs can thwart your desire to create your own future. Don't let your frustration stand in the way of your success. Slowing down to accommodate others also has a positive impact on your work. Instead of rushing ahead, it makes more sense to fine-tune your current plan before moving on."
capricorn,2014-05-01,Avoid falling into the trap of allowing today's whimsical Gemini Moon to drag your feelings all over the place. It's crucial to be highly selective about your social causes now because getting involved with too many groups -- even if they include amazing people -- might drain your energy. Demonstrate the sincerity of your commitment by picking one issue and sticking with it until you create the impact you want. Don't underestimate how much positive change one person can make.
aquarius,2014-05-01,"Your inner child is eager to play today, encouraging you to set serious responsibilities aside for a while. This lighthearted attitude enables you to enjoy yourself, but it may not be such a wonderful thing if you are up to your neck in work. Nevertheless, you are driven to seek spontaneous avenues of expression no matter how much your current commitments constrain you. Ultimately, a new approach to fulfilling your obligations can replace old counterproductive habits. A change of pace will do you good."
pisces,2014-05-01,"It feels as if you can't escape today as your head and heart are tugged in opposite directions by the clever Gemini Moon that reminds you to logically think your way through any problem. However, you Fish like to rely on your gut feelings to navigate your route to success because you know that facts can sometimes hide the truth. Keep in mind that your answer won't be found in the rational or the emotional side of the debate now. Instead, just jump directly into the fray without any extra thought and let intuition be your guide."
aries,2014-05-02,"You may have sent a clear message to your coworkers if you recently stood up for your values. However, you can't rest on your laurels now; you must solidify what you already started. Although you might want to change directions, it's not wise yet to let others in on your plans. Instead of saying what's on your mind, it's less complicated if you withhold your intentions until you're certain about your new path. Make the most of your power by conserving it until you are fully ready to take action."
taurus,2014-05-02,"You probably feel as if you're running into walls every which way you turn today because your current approach doesn't seem to be quite good enough. Your friends might not be very supportive of your new plans now that chatty Mercury opposes naysaying Saturn in your 7th House of Others. Don't try to talk your way around the resistance. Instead, step back and take time to further develop your ideas before trying again. Patience and persistence make for a winning combination."
gemini,2014-05-02,"Uncharacteristically, you might say yes to a social invitation out of a sense of obligation today, rather than from your desire to connect with others. However, your participation won't be worth it if you are only stepping through the motions. Don't let anyone push you into an extracurricular activity now unless you truly want to do it. Say no politely; everyone needs time to themselves now and then to replenish their spirits. There's no reason to apologize for taking care of your heart."
cancer,2014-05-02,"It could be annoying if someone arrives at your doorstep today with an opportunity that appears too good to be true -- because it probably is. Unfortunately, progress on any project is painstakingly slow now and nothing much will happen unless you decide to put in the extra time and energy. However, your efforts are thwarted as messenger Mercury forms an opposition with authoritative Saturn. Drag potential problems out into the open before they turn things sour, so they can be handled once and for all. Clearing the air might be a cathartic process for everyone."
leo,2014-05-02,"Although you are fully capable of taking the initiative when given the chance, caution sets in now as you attempt to reestablish balance in your life. Nevertheless, you can impress others with a stellar show today. But shortcuts won't be rewarded; it's crucial to start at the beginning and perform each step in the correct order. Don't waste energy stressing about deadlines since everything is likely to take longer than you expect anyway. Time is an illusion but your authenticity endures."
virgo,2014-05-02,"You might experience a setback today if your current plans are overly ambitious. But don't let your disappointment stop you from accomplishing something very real. You may need a quick refresher course in how to maintain a healthy level of confidence so you can improve your attitude. Reevaluate the practicality of your goals and if they stand up to your rigorous analysis, don't shy away from putting in some long hours of hard work to achieve them. Success doesn't come easily, but it's worth the effort if you really want to make a difference."
libra,2014-05-02,"It seems nearly impossible to circumvent authority now, so you must deal with control issues whether you like it or not. Unfortunately, you don't appreciate being told no or having other people delay your progress. Your diplomatic charm won't get you past the current resistance. However, engaging in an honest dialogue can set the stage for healthy compromise and a more harmonious working environment."
scorpio,2014-05-02,"Relationships are hard enough on their own, yet an intense interaction with a friend or partner could make the dynamics even more complicated today. You may be vying for control now that you're aware of the specific differences of opinion. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to push for resolution right away because this might lead to an emotional meltdown. Simply be as clear as possible when communicating your position and then let it go. You can still keep your heart open even if you move on."
sagittarius,2014-05-02,"You're a natural philosopher and are eager to discuss a complex situation at work today as long as you can maintain a bit of emotional detachment. But don't try to convince anyone of your moral superiority or you could alienate someone you would rather have as an ally. Think twice before heading toward the most intense topic possible. Instead, allow the discussion to meander without trying to manipulate the outcome. Surprisingly, you just might find yourself arriving at your destination sooner than you expect."
capricorn,2014-05-02,"You bristle at the thought of someone impeding your progress and yet you might have to acquiesce to an authority who successfully wrestles the controls away from you today. You may be tempted to fight back, but it's futile to pretend to be more informed than you actually are. Unfortunately, this kind of defensive maneuver will likely create more trouble than it's worth. Save time for everyone involved by being completely honest from the start. It's more productive to collaborate now than to waste energy in needless competition."
aquarius,2014-05-02,"You may experience unexpected panic now because you realize that time is running out and you still have lots of loose ends to tie up. Unfortunately, some things might just have to be left undone. Reset your priorities early in the day so you can stick to your plan since changing your schedule isn't something you like to do under pressure. Don't fight against the current circumstances; be willing to let go of your earlier expectations and move on. Adaptability is your secret weapon today."
pisces,2014-05-02,"Your conservative response to financial struggles might be the most sensible approach in the moment, but it probably isn't the best long-term solution. Tightening your belt may be necessary now because you can't spend what you don't have. But the problem is more complex and would benefit from a strategic attack on multiple levels. Fiscal responsibility combined with your own personal version of a stimulus package could help turn things around. Investing some money in your future can be just as important as saving it in the present."
aries,2014-05-03,"You may decide to wear your bigger-than-life intentions right on your sleeve where they are visible to everyone today. Unfortunately, you could inadvertently open a can of worms if you come on too strong with your air of independence. Others can also see how much you want your feelings to be acknowledged, even if you are ready to go it alone. Pay attention to the tone of your words so you don't offend anyone in your quest for self-expression. There's no need to push your agenda; the only sense of urgency is your own."
taurus,2014-05-03,"Circumstances might require that you become an emotional anchor for others. Your loyalty comes to the forefront today as you defend someone's opinions as if they were your own. Don't hold back; dramatic actions based upon deep convictions can have enduring consequences, especially in your closest relationships. People admire your consistent dependability, but don't lose touch with your own feelings in your rush to be a hero."
gemini,2014-05-03,"You're eager to kick up your heels today, but an inner voice is telling you that fun and frivolity are not all you need at this time. However, you probably won't listen to this cautionary line of reason now. Even if you know better, your rebellious side is more inclined to wander off and follow your every whim. But your conscience just won't leave you alone; the only way to silence it is to honor your commitments before beginning your pursuit of pleasure."
cancer,2014-05-03,"Luckily, you have the emotional fortitude to maintain your position, even in the stormy seas of change -- and things certainly are shifting now. You can feel the pressure building on several different fronts. Prepare yourself psychologically to engage the unknown because resistance is futile. If you try to ignore the faint music you hear today, it will only get louder and louder until you cannot avoid it. It's better to be ahead of the wave than under it."
leo,2014-05-03,"You are riding two conflicting waves of energy today. One is motivating you to jump on your surfboard and show everyone your tricks. The other is an undertow that is pulling you beneath the surface turbulence and into calmer and deeper waters. Although you may be naturally inclined to put on your happy face and shift into performance mode, it could be wiser to slip out of sight and spend time alone in silent contemplation. Set aside some space for quiet meditation or get outside into a natural setting that is good for your soul."
virgo,2014-05-03,"Sometimes you appear exceptionally cool on the surface so that people don't realize how strongly you are feeling on the inside. You may try to cover up your inner world, but there is a problem with this strategy today because your intense emotions are the current source of your drive. Find creative ways to express your deeply-rooted passions or others will never know the real you. Even if this vulnerability seems risky at first, it's time to reveal what's in your heart."
libra,2014-05-03,"You often like to lighten the atmosphere when things become too serious, but your penchant for avoiding the shadows is not motivated by your fear of the dark. Rather, it's your way to attempt to balance the energies when they are out of whack. However, you are being pulled into powerful tidal currents of complex feelings now. Don't try to avoid the truth that's lurking just out of sight. Keep breathing and flow with your emotions. You will emerge with a healthy new perspective if you have the courage to go deep."
scorpio,2014-05-03,"Initiating a dialogue about an emotionally complex subject today might lead you right into the heart of the matter. Even if you think the conversation will clear the air, it could take you on a tour into the mysteries of the dark. The good news is that reality is easier to cope with once you know the truth. Thankfully, you're well-equipped for such a spiritual quest as long as you carry the light of awareness with you. Just remember to bring extra batteries for your flashlight when you journey into the hidden realms of your subconscious mind."
sagittarius,2014-05-03,"You might not be feeling all that positive, but you have a strong inner resolve that you can rely on today-- no matter what stresses you encounter in the external world. Let go of whatever is already slipping away; circumstances are changing for reasons that you may not understand yet. Don't try to stop the process. Room is being created for exciting new opportunities which will be knocking on your door before you know it."
capricorn,2014-05-03,"A conflict in a relationship may put a damper on your day, but it won't likely be serious enough to derail your train of progress. You're moving forward now in various aspects of your life, but keep in mind that change and growth come slowly. Fortunately, you can stay on track and arrive at the station on time if you remember to keep your intentions out in front of yourself like a carrot on a stick. Be like the ""Little Engine Who Could"" and say, ""I think I can. I think I can."""
aquarius,2014-05-03,"Waves of powerful emotions wash over you today, leaving you overwhelmed and out of breath. As an airy Aquarius, your feelings can be kind of quirky, anyway. But your current reality isn't just based on a strange emotional twinge that quickly comes and goes. This feels bigger and more significant than recent experiences. Sink into your irrational desires without resistance. Discovering hidden treasure is only possible when diving into the unknown rather than remaining on shore."
pisces,2014-05-03,"Your desires are intense now and there isn't much that will hold you back from expressing what's in your heart. However, you may be more attracted to the idea of romance than the actual logistics of working in partnership. It helps to remember that love comes along with responsibilities. Seek creative ways to enliven your relationships with meaning; explore all the possibilities even if it's only in your dreams."
aries,2014-05-04,"You mean well when you ask the right questions, but sometimes others still perceive you as being too brash. However, today you are so connected to the moods of those around you that you might attempt to fix an awkward situation in order to make everyone feel at ease. You could appear to be someone's champion at first, but assuming responsibility for another person's emotions can lead to dependency issues and power struggles. Be a good friend without trying to run the show."
taurus,2014-05-04,"You can take a positive feeling to extremes now that the Moon joins joyful Jupiter in your 3rd House of Communication. Unfortunately, you probably won't get away with sharing too much information today because instant karma is lurking just around every corner, ready to remind you when you have pushed a topic too far. It's better to acknowledge your limits prior to stepping over them. Be wise and don't say anything you might later regret. Keeping your message simple paves the road to success."
gemini,2014-05-04,"You can find your groove today, even if it's a bumpy ride at first. You're capable of seeing what works best for you now, inspiring you to focus on your skills rather than your weaknesses. Pay attention to the amount of energy you expend so you know when to call it quits. Remember that over-inflating your expectations only sets you up for disappointment later on. Observing the emotional weather gives you the chance to know when to stop pushing. Work smarter not harder if you really want to make a difference."
cancer,2014-05-04,"Feelings of insecurity can be quite overwhelming now that the emotional Moon is visiting your self-protective sign. Fortunately, you shouldn't have too much of a problem today pursuing something that you want. However, you could create trouble if you demand more than you need. Ironically, you may feel frustrated even if you don't ask for anything because you want more than you receive. The point is that this isn't the best time to share all of your desires. Instead of bemoaning what's missing in your life, count your blessings; a grateful attitude will take you far."
leo,2014-05-04,"You might have a very specific idea about how you want to change the dynamics of the day. However, reality doesn't necessarily agree with your plans. Instead of digging in your heels and preparing to challenge anyone who blocks your way, try a more radical approach. Direct confrontation only isolates people's differences now. However, adapting to the needs of others puts them more at ease, enabling you to find your way back to what you ultimately want. Oddly enough, sometimes the direct route isn't the most effective one."
virgo,2014-05-04,"Although you want to demonstrate your magnanimity today, you could grow tired of dealing with people's hidden motives and decide not to engage in the games any longer. But your emotional withdrawal is a very powerful statement on its own, for nearly everyone understands that you analyze all the possible moves before deciding what to do next. Make sure not to burn any bridges today that you might want to cross in the days ahead. Compromise is only possible if both parties agree to meet somewhere in the middle."
libra,2014-05-04,"You have mixed feelings about a significant relationship now. On one hand, you're ready to put your plan into motion and do anything that is necessary to get your way. On the other hand, you're weary of feeling like you're the one who does all the work. In either case, you might end up wishing that you followed the alternative course. However, the obvious solution is to keep busy in your pursuit of success without expecting too much from others. Shift the focus and don't let your happiness depend on anyone else."
scorpio,2014-05-04,"Everyone seems to be telling you something different and, ideally, you would like to benefit from their wisdom. However, it's tricky to find the right balance between trusting your own experience and learning from others. Ironically, you can best see what is around the bend by relying on your intuition now, instead of seeking one more perspective. Although it's usually advantageous to have multiple points of view, today your own opinion counts more than anyone else's."
sagittarius,2014-05-04,"Your enthusiasm is contagious as you talk about a project that is coming together at the very last minute. But the evocative Moon's current conjunction with buoyant Jupiter is a mixed blessing, instilling you with confidence, yet also luring you into a familiar trap that makes everything appear better than it is. There's no cause for panic; it's wiser to act with a well thought-out plan tomorrow than with reckless abandon today. Channel your passion into your work for positive results."
capricorn,2014-05-04,"Someone attempts to manipulate your feelings today as the Moon travels through your 7th House of Partners, bringing an emotionally needy person to the forefront of your life. But this may not be such an easygoing relationship since you don't like the possibility of having your heart toyed with now. Attempting to reach a compromise or even bringing in a mediator can raise the stakes on a developing power struggle. However, you have another choice; you could take the high road and temporarily disengage from the disagreement. Stepping back for a while might be the simplest answer of all."
aquarius,2014-05-04,"You may feel as if you're in the midst of an emotional tug-of-war today, tempting you to seek solace from a more intellectual approach. Although you naturally excel in conceptual realms, the Moon's square to your key planet Uranus charges your actions with intensity and quickly pushes you to the edge of discomfort. Avoiding the urgency of your emotions sounds enticing, but it's actually a distraction from the real work at hand. The way out is the journey through the center, and nothing less."
pisces,2014-05-04,"Your process of self-expression receives an energetic boost today when the reflective Moon connects up with visionary Jupiter in your 5th House of Creativity. Your active imagination is temporarily freed from fear and other emotional constraints, allowing your fantasies to take you nearly anywhere. There's no reason to dwell on the negatives now when you can trip the light fantastic; channel your dreams into your art."
aries,2014-05-05,"You feel hot to trot and might not be able to slow down today. In fact, you can be so self-confident that you may say something you later wish you could take back; however, you only get to create a first impression once. Exercising a little caution along the way enables you to make quite a bit of progress now. Just make sure that you are taking the correct path before you start or you will pay the price for your impatience later on."
taurus,2014-05-05,"The needs of your friends or coworkers may be in direct conflict with your personal desires today. Thankfully, your confidence empowers you to talk about your feelings. You believe in your ability to succeed, but might feel cheated if you don't get the chance to share your point of view. Instead of trying to impress everyone with your sensible outlook, listen carefully to what others have to share with you before you go out on a limb. If you're lucky, you won't have to say anything at all."
gemini,2014-05-05,"Although a healthy self-esteem is admirable, you can find yourself in hot water today if you are overly cocky about what you think you know. You may be gifted with the ability to see what others can't now, as if you have x-ray vision. But currently there is so much going on in your life that it's hard to know where to begin. Don't be afraid to rely on friends to help you determine your most practical course of action, but trust your intuition in the end."
cancer,2014-05-05,Life would be a breeze today if you could just respond instinctively without having to rationalize your actions. But there is a plethora of information coming at you from a variety of sources that it's challenging to choose which data to trust. Your emotional concerns may have to be temporarily set aside now if you want to get to the truth. Give yourself extra time to separate the facts from the fiction. Nothing is gained when you buy into someone else's arbitrary schedule; only you will know when the time is right.
leo,2014-05-05,"Several extraneous ingredients have been recently added to the recipe, and there is not much you can do about it today. Unfortunately, you might not even realize that things have grown more complex than you expected. The good news is that you're fully capable of making the best of nearly any situation, so don't fall into the trap of thinking you are in a weakened position now. Luckily, the Moon's return to your sign empowers you to cook up a winning plan with whatever you are given."
virgo,2014-05-05,You're naturally skillful at integrating new information in a cool and methodical manner as you discern what's true and what's not. But you may be so eager to utilize the data today that you forget to do your usual careful analysis. This hurried approach can spell trouble as it leaves room for you to draw incorrect conclusions. Check your sources; facts are only as useful as their reliability. Don't act in haste; maintain your integrity at all costs.
libra,2014-05-05,"You may be so sure of the outcome today that you miss an important piece of information. Although you could be dealing with a very positive situation, don't be afraid to ask tough questions in order to reveal any undiscovered flaws. If a possible love interest tickles your fancy, play it cautiously now until you have all the specifics. It feels good to run through the happy possibilities in your mind, but you're only courting trouble if you make premature assumptions before you know the entire story."
scorpio,2014-05-05,"Storm clouds continue to clear now, revealing new horizons that appear in the distance. The intensity recedes, but you still may be left with too many unresolved questions. The power of positive thinking is a real help today, but don't let false optimism create a blind spot if you are still coping with a serious issue. Attempts to avoid unpleasant details will only make for an unstable situation in the future."
sagittarius,2014-05-05,"Everything seems to be coming up roses today as your desires are amplified by your key planet Jupiter. You're viewing the world through a magnifying glass now, tempting you to interpret the circumstances in such a positive manner that you could overlook something crucial. Although you're inclined to act first and ask questions later, your best bet is to wait a few days for a more realistic perspective to return. Take the next step once you can see things in their true light."
capricorn,2014-05-05,"Others usually rely on you when they need to know the truth, but the roles may be reversed today. You're tempted to swing into immediate action because an unexpected opportunity stirs your ambitious nature. Nevertheless, be prudent and dig up all the facts before you say yes. Even if you think you have a handle on your current choice, asking a close friend or family member for a second opinion is always a good idea. Thankfully, you have more time than you think to share your plans with someone you trust."
aquarius,2014-05-05,"You're not as rational as you believe you are today. Your logical mind is being bent out of shape by your dreams and you may not even realize that you have lost your perspective. You aren't seeing people as they truly are now, but as you wish them to be. You can compensate by slowing down and listening to what others have to say before jumping into an unstable relationship. Fortunately, an open line of communication is all you need to keep your balance."
pisces,2014-05-05,"Your feet barely touch the ground today as your key planet Jupiter amplifies your feelings of self-worth, inspiring you to feel optimistic about your future. This can be an auspicious time when you can transform your positive thoughts into concrete reality. But first you must check your facts so you don't get too far off track. You are riding a powerful surge of energy now, so keep your wits about you or you could find yourself arriving somewhere that was never your intended destination."
aries,2014-05-06,"You might believe that something has changed today, even if everything is actually still the same. You're in a very different place now, but the only thing that's really new is your attitude. Nevertheless, this internal adjustment may be enough to fill your sails with sufficient wind power to get you to your destination of choice. Don't hesitate or you could miss the chance to reach your goal."
taurus,2014-05-06,"Although you may feel absolutely sure of your current direction, you might begin to lose confidence later in the day. It's not that your certainty is unrealistic today; it's just that you're overlooking some of your options. It isn't a wise strategy to switch horses midstream unless you have an excellent reason to do so. Continue on your way with the faith that your confidence and your clarity will return in a few days."
gemini,2014-05-06,"Your emotions pull you all over the place today, making it nearly impossible to follow through with your original idea. Instead of resisting the winds of change, remain open enough to see where they take you. But you may need to let go of your previous expectations because you probably won't get as much work done as you wish. However, the payoff is that you might discover something invaluable about yourself that could be a game changer later on."
cancer,2014-05-06,"You may feel as if you have a fantastic idea and a solid plan today, but you worry about running out of steam before you reach your goal. You intuitively realize that the positive energy won't last and are afraid you won't be able to finish your work in time. Unfortunately, attempting to speed up your productivity isn't effective because sloppiness won't be rewarded. The truth is that you have more time now than you realize. Establish a sustainable pace and continue until you're satisfied with a job well done."
leo,2014-05-06,"Anticipation could drive you crazy today because you're itching to have some fun, but unfortunately you're going to have to wait. Instead of leaving work early or taking a long lunch with everyone else, you must be the responsible one now and set an example for others to follow. Your desire to escape from your obligations is tested as the expressive Leo Moon squares the practical Taurus Sun in your 10th House of Career. Patience, Leo; it will be your turn to play soon enough. Take advantage of this moment and let your natural talents shine."
virgo,2014-05-06,"You fully intend to take care of business today, even if your thoughts are not as focused as you prefer. You want to come through for your coworkers, but you might already be stretched too thin and are too busy to handle an extra job right now. Don't judge yourself too harshly; just do the best you can, even if your performance isn't perfect. Your extra effort will not go unnoticed, but it could take a couple of days before you receive the recognition you deserve."
libra,2014-05-06,"Your day might start out with a rush of optimism, but making progress seems to grow tougher throughout the day. Instead of pursuing a new opportunity today, postpone any important decisions until tomorrow afternoon when you should be feeling more realistic about the potential. Just remember that a hopeful attitude isn't enough; you need to bring your ideas down to earth now so you can convert them into constructive action. Taking the time to create a viable plan paves the way to your success."
scorpio,2014-05-06,"You're ready to tackle an unpleasant task today as if it was simply no big deal. Perhaps you realize the potential for reward is great if you are willing to get down and dirty. Stay open to where the detours of the day steer you, for you could end up somewhere very special -- even if it's totally different from your original destination. Embracing the uncertainty is the secret trick to realizing your potential."
sagittarius,2014-05-06,"A fast-talking friend or partner could have you saying yes or even signing the contract on a dubious deal before you have time to do your research. Take whatever sense of urgency that is presented to you with a grain of salt today, for the most substantial opportunities won't vanish as quickly as they appear. Step back from the pressure of the sales pitch and consider all the alternatives before making a commitment you may regret. The good news is that you don't have to decide until you have all the facts in order."
capricorn,2014-05-06,"Having so many emotionally intense thoughts running thought your mind can be a bit disconcerting to you since you prefer being more methodical in your analysis. However, there just isn't time to follow each idea to its logical conclusion today. Accept that you won't be able to make practical use of your intelligence now. Instead, let your brain loose and watch the colorful show without attempting to capture any single thought. Your imagination holds the keys to your success."
aquarius,2014-05-06,"A perfectly delightful day can go awry if you try to explain your new strategy to anyone else. You're working at a deeply intuitive level today and you probably won't be able to rationally justify your choices. Instead of wasting time talking, put all your available resources into doing. You can always share your logic with others once you've successfully finished your project. Follow your intuition and don't look back."
pisces,2014-05-06,Other people may believe that you have magical superpowers today even if you don't think you're acting any differently. All you have to do is follow the right hunch and stay ahead of the pack. It isn't rocket science that currently puts you out front; it's your uncanny ability to already know what's going to happen. Trusting your intuition while maintaining your humility gives you the edge you need to reach for the stars.
aries,2014-05-07,Your mind may wander in so many directions all at once that it's challenging to concentrate today. You are so optimistic now that you might actually believe you can successfully juggle everything you have in process. But even your enthusiasm has its limits. Stop for a moment and take careful inventory of what you're doing. Considering what could be temporarily eliminated enables you to fully focus on those tasks that should be top priority.
taurus,2014-05-07,"You could miss your chance if you don't take immediate action today. You have been waiting for the right moment long enough and further analysis won't likely bring you any more clarity than you already have. Although you cannot stop the thoughts from going in circles, you can lessen the noise by boldly moving ahead, even if you aren't one hundred percent sure of your choice. Nearly any movement now is better than none at all. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
gemini,2014-05-07,"Your message could get lost in a flurry of too many words today even if you have lots of clever ideas to share. Examine your motives closely; chatty Mercury's yearly return to your sign can make you even more loquacious than ever. If you want to be understood by others, slow down your delivery; keep your presentation short and to the point. However, if your goal is just to amuse yourself, you really don't need an audience at all."
cancer,2014-05-07,"The universe is giving you permission to escape today, even if only in your mind. Luckily, you can use your imagination to travel anywhere in time and space, for your thoughts seem as if they are almost real. Tread carefully; don't make the mistake of believing that fantasy is a replacement for real-life experiences. Visualize all the amazing possibilities before choosing where to go next. The sky is the limit."
leo,2014-05-07,"There just doesn't seem to be enough time in the day to connect with everyone on your mind. Your popularity feels quite lovely, but it also distracts you from the work you should be doing today. However, you could have the best of both worlds now if you concentrate on enjoying your interactions with others while you further develop your business contacts. Networking can be fun as you continue to establish your place within the community. You don't have to be the star of the show to have a good time."
virgo,2014-05-07,"Although you might appear to be overwhelmed at work today, you're a lot calmer than others realize. Your current strategy involves keeping your options alive because you think that following multiple paths is your most efficient way to reach a specific goal. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks of your plan; it has an excellent chance of coming together just as you imagine as long as you aren't sidelined by doubt. Believe in yourself and trust the process."
libra,2014-05-07,"You're more than willing to go along with someone who presents a good idea, even if it isn't part of your original agenda. However, you might be quite concerned now because you're beginning to realize that this new opportunity may be much bigger than you expect. You must make a critical decision that could have a significant impact on the direction of your life, so take your time before choosing your path. Fate is in your own hands today; you don't always have to say yes to please others."
scorpio,2014-05-07,"You're often the one who turns over every stone when searching for an answer because you are more afraid of what you don't know than what you might actually find. However, you are tempted to take a shortcut today and jump to conclusions instead of investigating every possibility. Fortunately, a spontaneous and creative approach can still provide you with exactly what you need and enable you to enjoy yourself in the process. Embracing the unknown is an adventure all on its own."
sagittarius,2014-05-07,"It's annoying today if someone repeats what you previously said, even if you are given full credit for the idea. But instead of criticizing others for their lack of originality, just be appreciative that your message was taken to heart. It is often said that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, so simply accept the compliment and move on. Seeing your ideas come to fruition is all that really matters."
capricorn,2014-05-07,"Although it feels refreshing when your mood lightens today, it might also make you a bit anxious because you believe you should be more productive. But it's challenging to let go of unfinished business, even if it's only for a temporary escape. The truth is that a little bit of relaxation can be quite rejuvenating. Taking some time off now gives you extra energy to accomplish your ambitious goals later on. Cultivating a healthy balance is a big step toward creating a happier life."
aquarius,2014-05-07,"You might feel as if you're fighting an uphill battle today, especially if there are unpleasant or boring tasks to complete. But if your job is enjoyable, then you should be able to find your groove and create some magic. It's your choice; no matter what you're doing now, you can turn it into a game. It's not the activity but your attitude that makes the difference between work and play."
pisces,2014-05-07,"You are highly animated today, which makes others assume that you want to be a part of the fun. However, your words may be misleading, hiding your current need for solitude. Fortunately, you can have your cake and eat it too; if you burn off some of your mental energy with your friends, it will be easier to settle down for some quiet contemplation in the evening. Just be sure to add your creative touch to everything you do."
aries,2014-05-08,"You can derive great benefit from applying your knowledge in a practical way today, especially if you keep your mind on point. Unfortunately, a string of distractions could set you off on a circuitous mental meandering, causing you to waste precious time. Give yourself permission to daydream now instead of being so self-critical because you are not as productive as you wish. The seeds of ambition are first planted in the fertile ground of your imagination."
taurus,2014-05-08,"Your long-term goals may not be as in touch with reality as you think. You might even face disillusionment if you try to cling to them too tightly. Unfortunately, working harder doesn't automatically turn a fantasy into something tangible. Take an objective look at your aspirations and consider whether or not they fit into a sensible plan. Once you have stepped through this preliminary review you will know whether or not to move forward."
gemini,2014-05-08,"You are like a butterfly that is flitting from dream to dream today, unable to stick with one long enough to make it real. If you insist on detaching from reality, at least pick your fantasies with as much consciousness as possible. However, don't get so caught up with your intellectual analysis that you lose touch with your imagination. There's a delicate dance between being inspired by your visions and misled by your illusions."
cancer,2014-05-08,"The boundaries between you and your closest friends are blurry today as the Moon's opposition to foggy Neptune challenges your ability to separate your feelings from the facts. You are eager to be in a fun-filled social setting now, placing you in close proximity with people you like. However, you should tread carefully because your emotional needs can lure you into tricky waters before you know it. Your colorful visions are a rich source of inspiration as long as you don't confuse them with the truth."
leo,2014-05-08,"You would prefer to float away on a big puffy cloud of dreams today, but it's wise to be conscientious about honoring your previous commitments first. It's unlikely that you can evade your responsibilities, yet neither can you take them too seriously. Practice walking in two worlds, with one foot grounded in reality while the other is exploring the outer reaches of your fantasies. Dancing with duality has its advantages when there is so much work to do."
virgo,2014-05-08,"Relying on help from others is tricky today, so consider striking out on your own. It's not that anyone will necessarily flake on you; it's just that it's very easy to misunderstand each other now. Even if you believe you hear everything clearly, you can still misinterpret the intent of what's being said. Don't try to fill in the spaces between the words with your false assumptions. Just listen closely so you don't inadvertently steer off track."
libra,2014-05-08,"You take great pride in your ability to weigh and balance a lot of information to decide what's most significant. Nevertheless, this sorting process feels like a real struggle today. Paradoxically, your cerebral tools are working fine; it's just that your imagination is functioning even better. Don't try to control your thoughts; slipping in and out of fantasy can reveal something important now about how you might be even more efficient in the long run. There's an infinite ray of possibilities ahead when you're open to the symbols of your subconscious."
scorpio,2014-05-08,"This might be a perfect day to make something special, create a masterpiece or redecorate your office. However, you may not be able to take time off from your regular work to pursue your artistic talents. Ideally, you could combine your desire to express your vision of beauty with what you must do in the real world. Don't give up on your dreams; channeling your passion into your creativity enables you to leave your world a better place than you found it."
sagittarius,2014-05-08,"You may be operating under the false illusion that if you could just stay home today, all your problems would be solved. As much as you need a serious chunk of time to yourself, escaping the real world won't make you any happier in the long run. Instead of wasting precious time withdrawing into Fantasyland, dedicate your efforts toward making your most important dreams come true. You have to build a ladder first if you want to reach for the stars."
capricorn,2014-05-08,"The best of intentions aren't sufficient to keep your mind on the work that is in front of you now. Nearly everything that happens appears to be another intriguing distraction which prevents you from honoring your obligations. Nevertheless, it's still crucial to demonstrate your tenacity today and come through for someone that matters or there could be a big price to pay later on. Work first, play later; your conscience will thank you for it."
aquarius,2014-05-08,"Expressing yourself precisely today could make the difference between success and failure. Nevertheless, it's essential not to build too much structure into your creative process or you'll miss the mark. Spontaneity can be the source of unexpected inspiration, leading to greater productivity, so don't be overly rigid at first. Adopting a more playful attitude allows you to get your message across without sounding too rehearsed. Throw away the script and speak from your heart."
pisces,2014-05-08,"You can unknowingly project uncertainty and confusion today, even if you're quite sure of yourself. There is a surprising split between your drive for practical accomplishment and your desire for artistic expression. Just make sure that your need to know the truth doesn't actually prevent you from finding it. Instead of being the scientist or technician now, try a more philosophical approach to balancing the mundane and the magical."
aries,2014-05-09,"You're reluctant to show your vulnerability, often covering it by jumping into action instead of waiting for something to happen. However, you might not be so quick to react because you're better at imagining all your possible responses today than actually putting one of them into motion. But it's not self-doubt that blocks your way; it's your current desire to take the most practical step possible. Ultimately, letting your dreams guide you is a better strategy now than trying to keep your feet on the ground."
taurus,2014-05-09,"Although your days may be as busy as ever, you are growing more adept at filtering out the excess noise. The choice is yours today; you can smile and walk away instead of engaging in all the commotion. Make use of the time you gain by relaxing in a quiet space. Meditating or daydreaming recharges your batteries and if you time it just right, you might not even be missed when you slip away for your little escape. Luckily, others will appreciate your improved attitude when you return."
gemini,2014-05-09,"You might have to reconsider your previous plans if you decide to add any more activities to your schedule now. However, you can take the power of positive thinking too far today. Your blind optimism could tempt you to over-commit, letting others down in the process and leaving you discouraged. Be cautious; managing your time wisely prevents unnecessary problems and enables you to accomplish more than you originally thought possible."
cancer,2014-05-09,"It seems as if you're receiving more help than you asked for today. Unfortunately, your first reaction might be to shut it all down by telling others that you can take care of your commitments by yourself. But you are in a unique position now and are capable of making steady progress on your long-term goals if you don't try to do everything on your own. In fact, accepting assistance is a sign of intelligence. Don't let your ego stand in the way of success."
leo,2014-05-09,"Enjoying simple pleasures whenever you get the chance comes naturally to you these days. However, you have chores to do now and it's not wise to put off your current obligations. There's no reason to tell everyone about your inner process, making it a good idea to keep your feelings to yourself today. Instead of stopping to justify your behavior, just continue to move deliberately through your day while taking the time to smell the flowers and savor the coffee along the way."
virgo,2014-05-09,"You're not interested in being the leader of the pack today; you prefer to be just another face in the crowd. But the reality is that not everyone is as committed to perfection as you are. The Moon's visit to your efficient sign now places you in touch with your drive to get things exactly right. Fortunately, you can be a valuable team player if you relax your high performance standards enough to collaborate with others. Sometimes it's more important to just get the job done."
libra,2014-05-09,You're hesitant about making a decision today that has a direct impact on others at work because you're not willing to determine the outcome on your own. You can usually take a few steps back and let someone else assume leadership responsibility. But it might be impossible to pass the buck now because everyone's depending on you. You have nothing to worry about as long as you check in with your intuition before choosing a path.
scorpio,2014-05-09,"Don't waste time lost in analysis because logical thinking won't bring you the best answers today. The rational realms can only take you so far now. Instead, trust your instincts because your psychic radar is right on track. Stop trying to explain your decisions to anyone; just listen to your gut. Oddly enough, your imagination offers solutions that are currently more practical than traditional methods. Dream your way to success."
sagittarius,2014-05-09,"You appear to be the life of the party today as the Moon in your 10th House of Status aligns with your key planet Jupiter. Nevertheless, you may be a bit worried that you're missing something very important. Go about your daily routine, but take some time to make sure you don't glide over unexpressed feelings that need to be addressed. Put away your philosophical justifications and move past your own resistance to explore deeper and more personal issues. Taking an emotional journey might be more rewarding than you can imagine."
capricorn,2014-05-09,"Someone may be tuning into your thoughts today, but you could be so busy working toward your goals that you don't even notice. However, connecting with others makes a big difference in your progress, so don't withdraw because you are worried about appearing vulnerable or dependent. Be bold; take the initiative and share your concerns with a friend you can count on. You might be pleasantly surprised by the positive reaction you receive to your disclosure if you are willing to speak from your heart."
aquarius,2014-05-09,"You're fully engaged with your immediate environment today and everything seems to be copacetic as long as you don't stop moving. You may believe that your emotions hamper your productivity. However, slowing down to consider the deeper significance of your current circumstances might be the smartest thing you can do. Fortunately, once you are back in touch with your heart, you will see things in a completely different light than earlier in the day when you were stuck inside your head."
pisces,2014-05-09,"You might be feeling more content today, even if your life is busier than you prefer. As long as you know you gave your best effort now, it's okay to be satisfied with your recent job performance. Ultimately, it may not matter if someone is on your case because you didn't pay enough attention to the details on a project. Thankfully, your happiness is not dependent on external events or the opinions of others. Integrate your own values into everything you do to lessen the importance of receiving approval from anyone else."
aries,2014-05-10,"There is little margin for error now; you must behave responsibly rather than ignoring your commitments while taskmaster Saturn opposes the willful Sun. Unfortunately, there aren't sufficient hours in the day to do everything you want and still meet your obligations. Although you hope to have as much fun as possible today, it's less painful to acknowledge your limitations sooner than later. Attending to  your business right away keeps things from unraveling later on."
taurus,2014-05-10,"You might not want to show all your cards today and luckily others won't even notice if you hold some in reserve. Just the same, it's wiser to face your fears and play your hand, or you could miss out on a big payoff. Instead of clinging to the status quo, it's more advantageous now to be flexible. Paradoxically, your willingness to negotiate and compromise reveals more inner resolve than digging in your heels just to prove your point. When opportunity knocks, don't hesitate to open the door."
gemini,2014-05-10,"It seems like you're running around in circles without getting much done now, yet you're ready to break out of an unproductive pattern. Although this new attitude doesn't mean that you will change your ways permanently, you are less inclined to sneak off and play today until you have finished all your chores. Thankfully, being disciplined enough to fulfill your previous commitments enables you to truly enjoy yourself later with a clear conscience."
cancer,2014-05-10,"A domestic issue demands your attention today, even if you wish you were doing something else. Unfortunately, any attempts to sidestep a serious situation only make the problem worse. Don't be afraid to let others know your position on a delicate matter. You might have to play the role of a heavy hitter and take a stand on what you believe is true. Although there is room to negotiate, everyone must know the score first. Don't retreat until you're sure that your message is heard. People often look to you for nurturing support, but your voice of reason is what they really need now."
leo,2014-05-10,"You have a few big ideas about what you want to do now, but first you must handle a tricky situation in your immediate environment. Don't waste energy fretting about the current restrictive conditions. It's more important to keep your promises than to run off in pursuit of a good time. Save your dreams for another day. There will be plenty of opportunities to play later on, but only if you do the responsible thing today."
virgo,2014-05-10,"You have to pay the piper today, especially if you waited until it's too late to follow through on your intentions. Thankfully, you can work wonders and make up for lost time if you put your mind to it. On the other hand, this might be a day of fruition as recent hard work finally shows signs of paying off. Either way, you still must complete unfinished business before you move on. Begin early in the day and, hopefully, you will find a quiet satisfaction in living up to your word."
libra,2014-05-10,"You may wonder why other people can take the day off while your responsibilities seem to be piling up to a tipping point. However, nothing is to be gained by comparing your plight to anyone else's. Your determination and discipline are being tested and you have an opportunity to demonstrate your dedication by working extra hard now, even under intense pressure. More importantly, you can prove that you're tough enough to handle whatever challenges come your way. This is your chance to recognize your strength and to banish any lingering self-doubt once and for all."
scorpio,2014-05-10,"You know exactly where you want to go today, but there's no obvious way to get there. There are obstacles blocking your path, but, thankfully, they aren't permanent. It's just that your ideas are being challenged and they must stand up to the current resistance. Forget about the big picture for a while and focus on taking one tiny step at a time until your progress becomes readily apparent. Once you make it through this eye of the needle you should be able to build enough momentum to carry you to your destination."
sagittarius,2014-05-10,"It seems as if your friends are being hypercritical of you today, and you might think their judgments are unfair. Perhaps they're expecting too much from you and you feel that they are keeping you from your pursuit of happiness. However, they are only protecting themselves from getting swept up into your next wild adventure. There's no reason to wallow in discouragement; you can follow your bliss whether or not anyone joins you on your journey."
capricorn,2014-05-10,"Others admire your stamina today; your hard work and perseverance enable you to reach your goals in record time. However, your patience is tested now as your key planet Saturn opposes the radiant Sun, requiring you to pull back on the reins of your life. Naturally, you prefer to continue progressing carefully toward your destination without having to slow down for anyone else. Nevertheless, the sooner you let go of your previous agenda and timetable, the easier it will be to create new and improved ones."
aquarius,2014-05-10,"Your friends may not realize that you are currently struggling to fulfill your commitments. The pressure could be intense enough that you're tempted to just walk away today, although that won't solve your problems, either. Fortunately, there's a third solution now; instead of taking an all-or-nothing approach, just reevaluate your priorities and give it your best effort. Make sure you let others know your revised schedule so they can adjust to the new deadlines based on your ability to deliver on your promises. You just might receive unexpected support from someone who appreciates your honesty."
pisces,2014-05-10,"A discouraging fog could roll in today, dampening the fires of your visionary inspiration. It's nearly impossible to be creative when your energy is pulled in more mundane directions and your resources are limited. Fortunately, you don't have to succumb to the negative atmosphere. These clouds shall pass; in the meantime, imagine the best-case scenario to show you the way and your faith will do the rest."
aries,2014-05-11,"You may convince yourself that you're on the right track, but you won't get others to believe you now unless you actually are. However, sharing your current plans with your friends and associates is a smart move because they can see through any faulty reasoning. However, keep in mind that your cleverness could backfire if you're too smooth in your delivery. Remember, it's better to know the shortcomings of your new strategy sooner than later or you will end up wasting a lot of time. Initiating an honest dialogue leads to a more realistic approach."
taurus,2014-05-11,You're caught between your natural need to be straightforward and your current tendency to embellish the facts. You're not purposefully trying to mislead anyone now; it's just that you might get mixed up between what you want and what is real. There's nothing wrong with sharing your dreams or taking a trip to Fantasyland as long as you tell everyone the truth. Your imagination is a garden where your best ideas can take root.
gemini,2014-05-11,"You are so persuasive now that others may rally to your support only to discover that your plans are not as practical as they sound. Your key planet Mercury awkwardly aligns with passionate Pluto and dreamy Neptune today, increasing the intensity of your words while decreasing your connection to the real world. Instead of having to untangle your story to get to the truth, it's wiser now to just work with the facts. Save your song and dance for a rainy day."
cancer,2014-05-11,"Solving a problem today won't bring you satisfaction if your solution is less than enchanting. The British poet Keats concurs and wrote, ""Beauty is truth; truth beauty."" However, you could mislead yourself into thinking you know where you want to go when you are actually heading in the wrong direction. It's time to put on a very practical pair of glasses. Ultimately, the best answers come to you now when you see things exactly as they are."
leo,2014-05-11,"You might not realize how forceful your actions are today as you attempt to get what you want. Even if you mean well, your friends could easily misinterpret your aggressive behavior, setting the stage for a war of words. However, an argument is just a waste of energy now because you're probably in closer agreement than you realize. Consciously softening your approach goes a long way toward making everyone happier in spite of the confusion. Listen more than you talk for the quickest resolution."
virgo,2014-05-11,"Your energy may be stretched very thin now because a recent burst of enthusiasm prompted you to say yes to one too many projects. Don't wait until you are mentally exhausted to make a change. Instead, exercise sensible restraint today because it's more important to follow through on what you already started, even if you are tempted to run off in search of the next great thing. Part of your charm is your dependability, so honor your commitments before you do anything else."
libra,2014-05-11,"You are engaged in a strange dance now between the old and the new. Your friends and coworkers may urge you to leave a worn-out habit behind, but you might not be ready to release your attachment to the past. Paradoxically, the more you analyze your current affairs, the more confused you become. Stop thinking long enough to act on what you are feeling instead of what others are telling you. The answer is simple: follow your heart and see where it leads."
scorpio,2014-05-11,"If you are lucky enough to have special people in your life that you can lean on, it may be disconcerting if they are not readily available today. You might feel as if you are being abandoned, but rest assured that isn't what's happening. In fact, your friends probably don't even realize the intensity of your current process. By simply changing your attitude you could turn this moment into an opportunity to explore your dreams without any interference from others."
sagittarius,2014-05-11,"Clinging to a desired outcome probably won't bring you much happiness today. You may come close to recapturing your lost sense of emotional security, but it slips away as you approach the magic moment of fulfillment. Instead of building your hopes up only to have them dashed, keep bringing your focus back to the moment at hand. It's perfectly fine to allow cosmic opposites to exist simultaneously without taking sides now. Let things hang in the balance until your clarity returns."
capricorn,2014-05-11,"It's as if you are at the movies, watching your fantasies unfold on the miniature silver screen inside of your head. Although each separate scenario represents a possible turn of events, you would rather be dealing with the hard cold facts and not dreamy illusions. Nevertheless, you can't just stop your thoughts by decree. Instead of trying to force change, recognize that today's fanciful excursions are an effective way to explore the potential of the present moment."
aquarius,2014-05-11,"You're being asked to forgo your rational approach now and adopt a more poetic style. Don't worry about being productive today because you have more pressing work to do reconnecting with your soul. Even if you can't explain your current spiritual yearnings to anyone else, rest assured that the right words will come later. But the magic won't happen on its own; you must take the time to cultivate your dreams and exercise your creativity."
pisces,2014-05-11,The good news is that you can still connect with your spiritual nature even if you are too busy to commune with others. It's not about how much time you can take from your hectic schedule now; it's more to do with how you use what's available. Just setting aside a few minutes for meditation or relaxation might be enough to get you back in the groove. Finding your center empowers you to reach for the stars.
aries,2014-05-12,"You may feel as if you must explain something you did recently, but don't say you're sorry until you reexamine your motives. Of course, a sincere apology is in order if you actually stepped over someone's boundaries. But don't just go through the motions today, pretending to regret your behavior if your intentions weren't clear. Remember, you are not responsible for how others react to your direct approach. Nevertheless, an extra dose of kindness goes a long way to smooth over ruffled feathers."
taurus,2014-05-12,"Even if you encountered a few rough spots at work last week, you will likely feel more optimistic about what happens today. Unfortunately, your change of heart could be motivated by your current eagerness to sidestep any more trouble. Make sure that you don't slip into denial so you can try to float through the day without worry. It's best to tackle stress directly and handle the situation calmly rather than acting like everything is fine when it's not. Others are depending on you to hold up your corner of the universe, so don't let them down."
gemini,2014-05-12,"You're in a generous mood when sharing what you want today, enabling you to use your charm to your advantage. But you could go overboard in your desire to be accommodating to those you like. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to acknowledge your own desires, even if you can't rationalize them at this time. Although operating in the realm of logic is naturally easier for you, it's not healthy to detach from your passions. Listening to your heart takes extra effort now, but it's worth it in the long run."
cancer,2014-05-12,"Your search to find balance between your inner and outer worlds today may fall short of your perfect scenario. Your direction at work might be changing yet you still are tempted to hang onto your old long-term goals. However, you're tired of fighting off the upcoming shift; surrendering to the larger wave now enables you to successfully ride it, instead of having it pull you under at the last minute. Making lots of small adjustments works better than trying to fix everything all at once."
leo,2014-05-12,"You are observing your life through a new pair of eyes today and what you see is different than ever before. A strange attraction could lure you to take the first step on an incredible journey but don't worry if you cannot envision a clear path yet. For now, any movement is better than none. Your destination will be revealed to you in due time. Follow your intuition and enjoy the scenery along the way."
virgo,2014-05-12,"You are growing tired of handling one surprise after another and may be craving a return to a simpler life. Fortunately, the fast pace could finally begin to slow down this week. In the meantime, pursue your interests but don't wear yourself out. You can't control anyone else's emotions, but you can change the way in which you react to unexpected events. Practicing flexibility is your smartest strategy for a while longer."
libra,2014-05-12,"Your emotions are running all over the place now and they become less manageable as you try to rein them in. Instead of attempting to stop your moods from changing, just go with the flow and express what you feel in the moment. Remember, there's no need to take action on any single thought today. Let your extreme reactions simmer over the next few days so you can gain clarity about what your heart really wants."
scorpio,2014-05-12,"Although others may be placing pressure on you to make up your mind today, it's their sense of urgency and not yours. Don't accept anyone else's arbitrary deadline as your own, for it could prompt you to make a foolish decision. Take your time and consider each possible choice. Wait until the reflective Moon enters your mysterious sign this evening to see your path in a brighter light. Follow your heart and don't look back."
sagittarius,2014-05-12,"You may have an emotionally detached view of your future and you don't really care which way the wind blows now as long as you're moving forward. Paradoxically, your perspective on the past is more complicated. Your strong opinions and desires might be projected on to your personal history, especially if you are retelling stories from your childhood. Reminiscing is a liberating exercise today, giving you a chance to recognize old patterns. Just don't attempt to rewrite the facts to support your current fantasy, or your sentimental journey will be for naught."
capricorn,2014-05-12,"Decisions in the workplace don't come easily now, for you can see both sides of most issues. But just because you can sympathize with multiple points of view doesn't mean that all choices are equally good. Continue weighing your options today, but put off your final answer until the Moon enters transformational Scorpio later tonight. There's no stopping you once you know which mountain you want to climb."
aquarius,2014-05-12,"Complex circumstances pull you off track today so it's pointless to think you're going to make noticeable progress toward your goals. However, you can still do amazing things as long as you don't waste energy fighting the inevitable. Everything is moving fast, so focus on the immediate events in the present moment instead of worrying about the future. By narrowing your attention, you will be able to experience the full power of now."
pisces,2014-05-12,"There's currently so much going on in your life that you might want to coast through the day. Of course, you must do a certain amount of work just to get by, but you intuitively know that it makes more sense to conserve your energy today than to expend it. Believe it or not, even more will be required of you soon enough. It's going to be a whole new ballgame, so you might as well rest up while you can."
aries,2014-05-13,"Your finances are on your mind today and you may feel more driven now than ever to take positive action. However, you might not respond well to the stress that comes from having to make big decisions at this time. But don't lose sight of your long-term goals or you could act impulsively for all the wrong reasons. Taking the time to observe the intensity of your current feelings is smarter than reacting to them out of fear. Developing your strategy before jumping in is your quickest route to success."
taurus,2014-05-13,"Relationships are fertile ground for growth these days and they can teach you a lot about yourself. But you could run into familiar obstacles to your happiness today even with the best of intentions. Be careful about being too rigid, for you might set yourself up for disappointment if you have too many expectations now. Pay attention to how your memories influence your current reactions. Remaining open to future possibilities is healthier than unconsciously replaying events from the past."
gemini,2014-05-13,"You're tempted to set aside your chores in search of exciting experiences, but the real growth opportunities come from making a commitment now and integrating your goals into your everyday routine. However, fulfilling your obligations might require you to decline an enticing invitation. Don't stress about what you may be missing; setting priorities and acting responsibly brings longer lasting satisfaction than a few hours of pleasant distraction."
cancer,2014-05-13,"You finally feel ready to express feelings that you have been keeping to yourself. You might be worried about how others will respond to your disclosure today, but something keeps pushing your fears away just enough so you can speak your piece. Although starting the conversation may seem awkward, don't back down. Your words could be the catalyst for a discussion that ultimately demolishes the emotional walls and establishes the foundation for a closer relationship. Take a risk and share your heart."
leo,2014-05-13,"Deeply-rooted fears might rise to the surface today, but don't let your worries prevent you from having a well-deserved good time. There's no reason to deny yourself a bit of pleasure if you have been putting in long hours and extra effort to achieve your goals. Residual negativity from a previous hurtful experience doesn't have to hold you back any longer. If it seems like reality is giving you no for an answer, make sure it's not really coming from you. Celebrate the little victories while you have the chance."
virgo,2014-05-13,"You may cherish your friends and family even more these days, but your dependence on them also causes you some concern. It's not that you're unwilling to show your vulnerability; it's just that you might want more time alone. If so, let others know what you need as kindly as possible so they don't feel rejected in the process. Setting healthy limits ultimately strengthens relationships as long as the wishes of everyone are heard and respected."
libra,2014-05-13,"You are no stranger to catering to other people's demands, but you may need to be very firm about stating what you want now. You could be tested today by a self-centered acquaintance who expects more from you than you are willing to give. Don't fall into the trap of questioning your own intentions. If you don't take care of yourself, you won't have much to offer anyone else. Establishing healthy boundaries is critical to your physical and emotional well-being."
scorpio,2014-05-13,"It's time to reexamine your relationships now that the evocative Moon is visiting your sign. Your emotional intensity has been known to scare some people away in the past. However, this is not a good reason to hide your feelings. It's better to know if someone is afraid of your passionate nature before you grow more entangled. Nothing is gained if you're downplaying your own inner strength just because it makes others uncomfortable. Surround yourself with people who love you for who you are, instead."
sagittarius,2014-05-13,"There is a lot more going on in your world now than meets the eye. You may be playing for big stakes and your next moves are crucial to your success. Fortunately, you don't have to share your inner process with everyone you meet. However, if you are captivated by someone -- or by a new idea -- don't push to get closer. Give it time; your perspective might change along with your feelings over the next few days. Wait and see what happens before you act in ways you can't undo. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
capricorn,2014-05-13,"Even if your friends and coworkers are usually supportive of your behavior, they may withhold approval today for no obvious reason. Nevertheless, you're pretty sure that you're doing the right thing and you're willing to wait for others to come around to your point of view. There's no need to waste energy trying to convince anyone to join your cause. Your actions don't have to be bold to be successful; they only need to be well-considered and effective for everyone to take notice."
aquarius,2014-05-13,"Although you might run into a complicated emotional web today, it's advisable not to get involved in any sticky business that isn't yours. Steering clear of confusing situations and political undercurrents demonstrates that you can be conscientious and productive at the same time. Instead of wasting time on the telephone or gossiping at the water cooler, set a quiet example by taking the higher road and focusing on the work at hand."
pisces,2014-05-13,"You may finally be in a position to be acknowledged for your contributions today, even if you aren't standing on center stage. The appreciation you receive now for your previous efforts could be long overdue, but this doesn't make it any less real. Just make sure you don't let the accolades go to your head, or you might lose the respect that you worked so hard to gain. It's wonderful when your talents are recognized, but it's your kind and humble heart that makes you truly shine."
aries,2014-05-14,"Pursuing your desires gets your adrenaline pumping, but feelings can grow more complicated than you expect with the enigmatic Scorpio Full Moon spotlighting your 8th House of Intimacy. You must be cautious when expressing your needs today because it's difficult to stop once you start to stir up some excitement. Although you're often the first one to take a risk, it might not be such a good idea now. Believe it or not, sometimes your feelings should be kept to yourself."
taurus,2014-05-14,"Today you could discover that you overcommitted in a relationship, making you feel as if you can't deliver on what you promised. However, you need to be careful with your assumptions now that the Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 7th House of Partnerships. You may not even notice that you have taken on too much until it's too late to change your course. Nevertheless, it's still wise to reconsider your plans and establish new priorities once you realize that you made a mistake. Taking responsibility for your actions is the right thing to do."
gemini,2014-05-14,"Your daily routine has a strong impact on your overall health and the current stress prompts you to stop and consider how to make things better. But with today's Scorpio Full Moon shining in your 6th House of Routine, it's counterproductive to turn your life upside down all at once. Make small improvements without creating chaos. Even a slight upgrade to your exercise regimen or a minor modification to your diet could be enough to add an extra bounce to your step."
cancer,2014-05-14,"You might take a relationship too seriously now and try to transform a casual friendship into a full-blown romance. It seems as if it would be easier to lighten the emotional weight, but the unrelenting Scorpio Full Moon's presence in your 5th House of Love may mean that your feelings are beyond your conscious control. Don't try to redirect what is in your heart; just let the currents carry you along for the ride today. Remember, it's prudent to observe your changing desires without impulsively acting on every whim."
leo,2014-05-14,"You may be misled by a close friend or family member who charms you with their convincing sales pitch. It isn't that you're naturally gullible, but the Scorpio Full Moon occurring in your 4th House of Home and Family encourages you to trust others if they carry an air of authority. Exercise caution by doing your research before making any promises you might later regret. Reining in your enthusiasm is your best move until you can determine what's really going on."
virgo,2014-05-14,"Your big ideas could sweep you off your feet today. You might attempt to keep everything in a practical perspective but today's Scorpio Full Moon lights up your 3rd House of Communication, bending your thoughts out of shape. Thankfully, by exercising a little self-restraint, you can minimize problems that arise from inflating a sensible strategy into an overextended one. Wait until next week to finalize your plans. In the meantime, explore all the possibilities without the pressure of commitment."
libra,2014-05-14,"You might need to be conservative about spending money on discretionary activities while the magnetic Scorpio Full Moon stretches your 2nd House of Resources out of shape. However, you still may be tempted to purchase something prior to analyzing the real costs. If you're unsure of what to do, ask for advice from a trustworthy friend or a financial expert. Thankfully, involving someone else in your decision-making process will bring clarity as to whether or not you can really afford to satisfy your desires now."
scorpio,2014-05-14,"It seems as if time has run out, making you aware of how much work you have on your plate today. You may decide to postpone a previously scheduled getaway to finish a project that's on a very tight schedule. Additionally, the passionate Scorpio Full Moon emphasizes the urgency of your feelings as it lights up your 1st House of Self. Although your initial response might be to focus on your responsibilities and delay your fun, there is room for both work and play. Instead of giving up all of your freedom, make a plan that allows you to meet your deadlines and chase your dreams, too."
sagittarius,2014-05-14,"Your current schedule may be packed, yet you're still clever enough to turn your work into play. Nevertheless, your day probably won't unfold the way you planned it since the Scorpio Full Moon activates your 12th House of Destiny. However, your temporary lack of judgment encourages you to get involved in one too many projects now. Ultimately, it's less stressful for you, and certainly more considerate of everyone else, if you set reasonable limits before making any more promises you can't keep."
capricorn,2014-05-14,"You want to be more involved with others now, even if you don't have enough time for yourself. You may be overwhelmed with one too many commitments while the intense Scorpio Full Moon aligns with restrictive Saturn in your 11th House of Social Networking. However, avoiding your personal needs only increases your anxiety. Establishing priorities is a sensible place to start, but only if you add your heart's desires to the list. It's fine to be attentive to the wishes of everyone else as long as yours don't get lost in the shuffle."
aquarius,2014-05-14,"You secretly enjoy it when others acknowledge your wisdom by seeking you out for advice. You might even feel hurt if they go to someone else for help first. However, your motives may not be completely clear today with the subjective Full Moon brightening your 10th House of Responsibility. You could be more interested in being distracted from your own problems now than you are in solving anyone else's predicaments. Fortunately, you can still be of assistance to those you love, no matter what your reasons are in the moment, as long you have their best interests at heart."
pisces,2014-05-14,"If you have been dreaming about furthering your studies, this is your chance to pursue something completely different from your current interests. You may need to make an important decision about going back to school now that the provocative Scorpio Full Moon illuminates your 9th House of Higher Education. Unfortunately, you could get lost in the logistics of unrealistic goals. But rather than setting your plans aside in frustration, try modifying them to align more closely with reality. Bringing your vision down to earth makes it much easier to manifest."
aries,2014-05-15,"Your mind is wired with so many exciting possibilities today that it's hard to know which way to turn first. However, you might also wish that you had more stability in your life now. These divergent feelings could grow into a real dilemma, especially if you aren't willing to admit that a part of you is very comfortable to continue with your same old patterns. Once you acknowledge your basic need for security, you can happily return to chasing your dreams."
taurus,2014-05-15,"You aren't easily satisfied today as your key planet Venus joins unpredictable Uranus, tempting you to reach for something or someone that you cannot have now. Instead of wasting your time trying to fulfill your transitory desires, talk about your dreams with someone you trust. Scaling back your expectations isn't a sign of defeat but offers an unexpected opportunity to create a practical plan that could actually succeed."
gemini,2014-05-15,"Socializing with your friends sounds quite enticing today, but it may be tricky to actually follow through with your plans. Someone close to you might need your assistance and you can't ignore a request for your help. It's critical to process any unexpressed anger or resentment you have over a change of schedule so that it doesn't get in the way of a meaningful experience. Being adaptable enables you to make the most of a difficult situation. In fact, if you remain open you might be pleasantly surprised with where the unexpected twists and turns take you."
cancer,2014-05-15,"It's important to put on a happy face today, even if you're reluctant to let go of your worries. But reflecting your joyful nature is not a license to avoid the pressing issues of the day. Your smartest strategy is to stay consciously aware of the current duality; remember that your inside and outside are following different scripts now and you don't have to fit everything into a tidy package. As the stress continues to settle down, your temporary smile just might turn into a permanent grin if you let it."
leo,2014-05-15,"Your mind is not on work today, even if you can't escape your responsibilities. You're zooming off into the future, looking forward to a bit of indulgent behavior. Unfortunately, your need for fun and games may be incongruent with your previous commitments. Remember, you don't have to take an all-or-nothing approach. There's no need to be overly self-critical just because you're human. Cut yourself some slack and enjoy the present moment however you can."
virgo,2014-05-15,"Although you can't shake your natural tendency to be practical, especially as the Sun moves through earthy Taurus, you're still looking to stir up some mischief today. Thankfully, work and play are not incompatible, but you could run into a problem as you try to juggle the two. Your day becomes more complicated if someone throws you a curve ball by inviting you to do something special. Your pragmatic inclination is to say no, but the cosmos is telling you to take a chance and say yes."
libra,2014-05-15,"Someone might shock you today by expressing what they want without censoring their words. Luckily, beautiful Venus bumps into radical Uranus, encouraging you to enjoy what you hear even if the disclosure is totally unexpected. Although you are being invited to step outside your comfort zone, you don't have to accept unless you're ready. Nevertheless, don't close down your feelings in fear. At least consider the potential of new and different experiences. Exploring your options in a conversation may feel safer now than actually acting on an impulse."
scorpio,2014-05-15,"You're eager for change and you may become agitated today if you have to do things the same old way. However, if you can't break out of your current routine, at least you can still talk about your desires. But even if you think you're being lighthearted, your words might carry sharp hooks. You are a champion of sarcasm now; your dry humor and incisive wit could be more biting than you realize. Don't water down your ideas but do your best to express your truth with kindness. And then don't forget to give your audience a fair chance to offer their opinion."
sagittarius,2014-05-15,"Your current dilemma could pit your desire for fun against a more responsible need to save money. Your financial condition might be a bit unstable now, yet you don't want a lack of expendable cash to deter an impulsive spending spree. Fortunately, you may discover that it's easier than you thought to cut back on unnecessary spending without negatively affecting your quality of life. Keep in mind that adding excitement to your day doesn't necessarily have to cost anything at all. The best things in life are free."
capricorn,2014-05-15,"Your private life is anything but boring these days. Unfortunately, tension in your personal world might mean that you don't have as much stability as you prefer. Oddly enough, the regularity of your job could take some of the pressure off by giving you the daily consistency you crave. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to let your professional duties keep you from dealing with the stress at home. Confront the uncertainty by initiating an open dialogue. Resolution may not come right away, but everyone will feel better once you get the conversation started."
aquarius,2014-05-15,"You're on a thrilling joyride today and your creativity is soaring. But just because you're enjoying the adrenaline rush doesn't mean that everyone else is on board, too. You're often captivated by unconventional ideas, but now you're passionate about anything that's off the beaten path. Don't let your attraction to radical thoughts and unusual behavior sidetrack a productive day. The good news is that being responsible doesn't have to prevent you from going anywhere you dream in your imagination."
pisces,2014-05-15,"You might think that someone's trying to make you feel guilty today, especially if you're acting rebelliously and want to do something unusual that fills you with pleasure. However, it's not your job to keep everyone else happy while you are left out in the cold. This is a great time to experiment and express yourself in radical ways. Stepping outside of the box can lead to surprising satisfaction, and being adventurous also elevates your self-esteem. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
aries,2014-05-16,"Your need for adventure could get the best of you today. Even if you have important responsibilities to fulfill, you still might ignore them to make more time for pleasurable pursuits. Although you may feel invincible now, you probably won't be able to escape unnoticed. Don't act surprised if you are held accountable for any impetuous actions. As is often the case, you're eager to leap into action before thinking about the consequences. However, counting to ten before you make a move makes more sense."
taurus,2014-05-16,"It's unproductive to spend a lot of time today doubting your own priorities. Nevertheless, your desires may not be as altruistic as someone else's now. Keep in mind that everyone is different and comparing yourself to others is a pointless exercise. Leave competition on the playing field where it belongs and simply do the best job you can. Being true to yourself is the surest route to success."
gemini,2014-05-16,"Others may encourage you to take on more than you can handle today as the enthusiastic Sagittarius Moon visits your 7th House of Partners. Fortunately, you could be revitalized by your accomplishments if you agree to contribute to someone's project. However, you might already be busy and turning down an invitation places you in an awkward position. Nevertheless, it's better to be honest now than sorry later. There's no point in making promises you can't keep."
cancer,2014-05-16,"You might surprise yourself with your desire to participate in someone's plan now, especially if you need to relinquish control in the process. It may even be a relief to be a passenger without having to also play the role of a back-seat driver. It doesn't matter what kind of activities you already have on your calendar; the thought of doing something different today brings a smile to your face. Oddly enough, sometimes playing a supporting role is more fulfilling than being the star of the show."
leo,2014-05-16,"You have the green light to put on your party shoes and kick up your heels today as the fun-loving Sagittarius Moon travels through your 5th House of Play. No matter how popular you are now, set aside some time just for yourself. Get outside for a walk, schedule a massage, or do something creative that helps you to unwind. A bit of solace is enough to recharge your batteries. Today, it's truly all about you."
virgo,2014-05-16,"Your coworkers often rely on you to think critically and calmly analyze the situation at hand. However, you may not be very logical now because you're seeing the world through a very optimistic lens. Even if your life is in really good shape, you still might be happier if you delay an important decision and simply kick back and enjoy yourself today. The Moon's visit to your 4th House of Family suggests that you should find some time to relax at home instead of making your imprint on the world."
libra,2014-05-16,"Your I-can-do-it attitude tempts you to say yes to every good idea and every intriguing invitation that comes your way today. Unfortunately, your eyes may be bigger than your stomach now because pursuing each opportunity takes time and you will run out of room in your day while you're still adding items to your plate. Scale back your expectations just a bit; you can still partake in pleasurable activities without overdoing it. Moderation is key."
scorpio,2014-05-16,"Your idea of a successful day includes a bit of relaxation. Unfortunately, you won't likely have time to slow down and take a break today. Your willingness to adapt to changing circumstances can be your secret weapon now. Even though you must follow through on your commitments, you know that improving your attitude makes all the difference in the world. It's even possible to have fun while maintaining your hectic schedule, especially if you understand that you can rest on another day. Whistle while you work and see who joins in."
sagittarius,2014-05-16,"You may be eagerly lost in your current exploration of all the things you want to accomplish today. Unfortunately, you might not make much progress if you try to do too much. Your energy level is probably quite high now that the Moon is visiting your sign, enabling you to respond to others quickly. However, you can easily burn through your reserves faster than you expect. Even if you think you're the Energizer bunny, it's smarter to react slowly and steadily like the tortoise if you want to finish the race."
capricorn,2014-05-16,"Your natural tendency is to control your exuberance even when you're excited. However, your enthusiasm is even more invisible to others today as the inspirational Sagittarius Moon visits your 12th House of Secrets. Nevertheless, there's a quiet spirituality about you now; others know that more is going on than meets the eye. Let your friends and acquaintances draw whatever conclusion they may. Just remember that you don't need to waste your energy on maintaining privacy when you have more important things to do."
aquarius,2014-05-16,"Playing down your confidence is a clever way to sneak in beneath the radar today. If your coworkers are aware of your positive energy, they will likely expect even more from you. However, if they can't see the twinkle in your eye, you might be able to get away with a bit of social mischief. Although your strategy may be sound, your plan can still backfire. You have a better shot at achieving satisfaction now by letting the good times roll and not worrying about anyone else."
pisces,2014-05-16,"Your coworkers may be the source of inspiration today as they unexpectedly include you in their adventurous plans. Unfortunately, things can grow complicated if there are overlapping events because you obviously can't do two things simultaneously. Make smart choices early in the day to lessen the stress that could arise if you try to juggle too many activities. For now, less is definitely better than more."
aries,2014-05-17,"You might not be very happy today, for it could feel as if someone is raining on your parade; however, this is just a test of your character. You must change your attitude to take the problems you now face in stride. Thankfully, you're able to overcome obstacles, but you will have to get more serious when it comes to your commitments. Rolling up your sleeves and putting in the effort early in the weekend increases your chances for fun later on."
taurus,2014-05-17,"You're dedicated to living your life in accordance with your beliefs, but there could be differences of values that arise today, requiring a frank discussion with a friend. Don't make the mistake of taking questions from others as personal attacks, for you might be overly sensitive now. Be as clear as possible in all communication while accepting criticism gracefully. Cooperation breeds success."
gemini,2014-05-17,"If someone presents you with an intriguing opportunity today, don't assume it's a final offer. You could have some serious negotiations ahead and you have a better chance of getting what you want if you think through your strategy in advance. However, the other person may end up dictating the terms if you try to make it up as you go along. Doing your homework can make all the difference in the world."
cancer,2014-05-17,"Don't be afraid to take the initiative in a relationship now as uncertain feelings fade. If you're standing on the solid ground of clear thoughts, you can continue to gain emotional strength throughout the day. Just make sure that you express your needs and desires without being bossy. Partnerships work best when all your cards are on the table and everyone knows the score."
leo,2014-05-17,"Channel the creative energy of the past few days into something constructive now. Your dreams will fade unless they are stabilized with concrete action, yet dedication and focus can transform fantasies into reality. However, this process also requires discipline and sweat, but it could surely be worth your extra effort. You'll never know unless you try."
virgo,2014-05-17,"You don't have to relinquish any authority today, but neither do you need to be everyone's parent. Although you may be more serious now, your playful inner child will come out to have some fun when it feels safe. Your imagination is lit up in vivid colors, so use your new sense of creative confidence to turn drudgery into spontaneity. Remember, a more joyful approach to life can actually improve the quality of your work."
libra,2014-05-17,"The high-flying ideas and big talk of the past few days are now put to the test of reality. Honesty and optimism are surely admirable traits, but they require a solid commitment to transform them into something tangible. Be a planner today and apply your energy wisely to make the difference between success and failure. Patience and hard work are an unbeatable combination in the long run."
scorpio,2014-05-17,"Your recent efforts are coming to fruition and may begin to pay off now. This might not be the best moment to sit quietly on the sidelines, but you're not quite ready for the big debut yet. Take small steps to offer guidance to your peers today, but don't attempt to run the entire show. There's no need to assume full responsibility for your new direction yet; just plant the seeds and let everyone respond accordingly."
sagittarius,2014-05-17,"A serious mood washes over you today, but your somberness doesn't have to mean the end of the fun. It's just that more important issues are coming back into focus. Be sensible now and manage your resources carefully. Remember, you are the archer; aiming your intentions with consciousness increases the chances of hitting your mark."
capricorn,2014-05-17,"You wish everyone would come down to earth and talk about the future with you because you believe you know exactly what to do. Even if no one seeks you out for advice now, overplaying your authority card won't bring the results you seek. Don't worry; your knowledge will still be greatly appreciated as long as you don't make others feel inferior. A little humility goes a long way."
aquarius,2014-05-17,"You and your friends may have hatched some brilliant ideas recently, but now you must make something happen in the real world. Talk is cheap; it's time to turn theory into practice. Don't try to avoid the practical necessities today. Play by the rules and demonstrate how your plan can help you and others be more successful. Roll up your sleeves and get to work."
pisces,2014-05-17,"You have been carrying a heavy load, but now others are ready to jump in and help you bear the burden. Unfortunately, you might have grown weary along the way. If so, don't hesitate to ask for assistance since playing the role of a martyr rarely pays off. There's plenty of support available to you, if only you let others know exactly what you need today. You may be pleasantly surprised with the results if you're willing to show your vulnerability and delegate some of your work."
aries,2014-05-18,"You can talk a good relationship game today as your feelings are pulled into realms that are illuminated by your words. Your fantasy life is rich now, which in turn fuels the fires of romance. It all comes back to one question: how do you feel about yourself? This is not about the bravado that you display for others. It is about who you really are and what your heart needs. Instead of pretending that all is well, take a risk and be your authentic self."
taurus,2014-05-18,"There are two distinct voices in your head today. One is enticing you to enter the dance of relationships. This voice encourages you to move out beyond your own bubble and emotionally connect with someone else. Meanwhile, there's another voice telling you not to make any sudden moves and stay within your own internal fantasy world where it is safe, but lonely. Listen to both points of view for the best possible outcome."
gemini,2014-05-18,"You are alive and buzzing on the mental plane of existence, but the real growth for you now is in the deeper emotional realms where you are being drawn. Perhaps your current exploration is motivated by a romantic attraction or a curious fascination. However, this is about a pleasure that is deeper than clever words can convey. Take a more creative approach to expressing your feelings today; sometimes you must stop talking in order to say what you really mean."
cancer,2014-05-18,"If you are in a position where you can spend time developing your creative skills, then this might be a most fruitful time for you. It's not that you are irresponsible; just because you are fond of daydreaming doesn't mean you are intentionally trying to avoid your commitments. However, the right words still arouse your desire to escape. Nevertheless, it's better to capture a bit of the magic rather than letting it capture you."
leo,2014-05-18,"You're more serious about finding meaning from your relationships with friends and associates today. You could even be drawn into social activities that aren't normally your cup of tea, but it might be in response to someone close to you who is giving you mixed signals. Perhaps the messages are not as contradictory as you think they are. In fact, it may be the receiver that needs tuning and not the transmitter. Look beneath the uncertainty to figure out what you truly want."
virgo,2014-05-18,"Your word for the day is nuance, but it could get lost in the outer noise. Keep in mind that it's less important what you say now than how you say it. There's a vast difference in the various shadings of gray, and it may be the very subtle perceptions that have the biggest impact. Don't be afraid to spend the necessary time to be certain that you have a realistic perspective on things. Otherwise, you might make a mountain out of a molehill for no reason at all."
libra,2014-05-18,"There's no need to go out of your way to make your situation look more attractive than it is today, even if that's your natural tendency. You can fall in love with the idea of love, instead of what or who is actually in front of you. The most significant problem you now face is emotional inflation, inspiring you and others to over-commit or over-spend. There's nothing wrong with an occasional bit of extravagance as long as you don't take it too far."
scorpio,2014-05-18,Just because you have strong desires and a big appetite now doesn't mean that you must pursue everything that catches your eye. It is okay to just let yourself feel; it's even okay to wander around inside your own fantasies for a while. No one has to know what you are conjuring up within the privacy of your own imagination. Your mind is hyperactive today and the emotions attached to your daydreams might feel overwhelming. Sharing only on a need-to-know basis prevents you from having to justify your attractions to anyone else.
sagittarius,2014-05-18,"If you can keep your ego in check and your needs in line, you could be in for a most incredible day as your key planet, Jupiter, is stressed by sweet Venus. Fortunately, this may feel like a good kind of stress because having more of a pleasurable experience is a good thing in your book. Of course, the potential dangers include over-estimating and over-indulging. William Blake wrote: ""The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom."" Enjoyment is the key word now, but knowing when to stop still makes sense."
capricorn,2014-05-18,"Today can be a bit unnerving as all attempts to keep your feet firmly on the ground are defeated by the sometimes magical and oftentimes confusing temptations of the day. You might struggle to find a middle path in the chaos. But if you are too somber and attempt to plant yourself too deeply into the practical realms, you could miss the magic. On the other hand, if you forget that you are an earth-bound Capricorn goat, you just may go drifting off into space. Dancing on the edge between reality and fantasy gives you the best of both worlds."
aquarius,2014-05-18,"Boundary issues can create complications as others convince you to become involved in circumstances that don't really belong to you. But you're fascinated by all the amazing opportunities and could momentarily forget about what you previously learned. Your curious nature and sense of wonder make it easier for you to let down your guard. Vulnerability is not necessarily a bad thing, but now it is more of a distraction when you just want to have some fun."
pisces,2014-05-18,"Sometimes the waters appear so crystal clear that you intuitive Fish actually believe that you can see forever and a day. However, the truth is that even the clearest of waters create visual distortion. Normally, you take this simple fact into consideration, but now it is tempting to forget that things are not as they seem. Step back and remind yourself to get a reality check before you find yourself in too deep. Trust your psychic radar but take your paddles just in case."
aries,2014-05-19,"Even if you have important obligations to fulfill today, you can probably figure out how to involve your friends and make your work more fun. It's all about relationships now as assertive Mars turns direct in your 7th House of Partnerships. You could feel like Tom Sawyer, making your chores appear so enjoyable that others want to jump in and join you in your efforts. Everyone may end up having a wonderful time, regardless of the work at hand. Ultimately, it's the feeling of camaraderie that makes this day a memorable one."
taurus,2014-05-19,"You would like to demonstrate your intelligence today so others see you as a masterful leader. Staying two steps ahead of everyone else enables you to command just enough authority to be in charge. However, you might have a challenging time with all the responsibilities that come with the territory of being seen as the top dog. Figuring out your next move requires patience because you're not sure about the choices you have to make. Worrying won't make anything better, so just decide the best you can and move on."
gemini,2014-05-19,"Thinking about your future fires up your imagination while the evocative Moon travels through your 9th House of Faraway Places. However, everything grows more complicated if you have to include others in your dreams. At first, you may enjoy the idea of developing a strategy to get someone else involved, but executing a concrete plan is more challenging than it appears. You might even grow irritated because your friend isn't interested in playing by your rules. If the frustration level escalates today, don't be afraid to just take the high road and proceed on your own."
cancer,2014-05-19,"You have managed for a while to pull off a balancing act between your personal needs and your public responsibilities, yet now a conflict with a close friend or partner complicates things even more. You don't care about the superficial aspects of what's happening; you need to share on a much deeper level now. Nevertheless, it's not easy to open up if you are afraid of being hurt. Revealing your emotions without being overly attached to the outcome is no easy task, but it can alleviate the pressure, enabling you to overcome your fear and speak from your heart."
leo,2014-05-19,"Even if you're very hopeful about a new relationship today, you still may experience wide mood swings as the emotional Moon activates your 7th House of Partners. There is no reason to allow your fear of abandonment to stop you from connecting with others; don't over-personalize a situation if someone inadvertently excludes you. You are best off trusting your friends and giving them the same freedom now that you want given to you."
virgo,2014-05-19,"Although you may be feeling a bit anxious today, setting priorities and concentrating on the most practical chores should help to soothe your nerves. Unfortunately, maintaining your focus isn't a simple task because you can see so many possibilities ahead, making you more resistant to the upcoming changes. Bring your thoughts back to the here and now, since the present moment is the only place where you can create a real impact. Don't worry about the inevitable; your future will arrive exactly on schedule."
libra,2014-05-19,"Looking back over the past couple of months might reveal less progress than you expected while energetic Mars retrograded in your sign. But now, as the action planet turns direct, you could be envisioning a big leap forward. Just remember that it takes time for the momentum to build, especially when coworkers are part of the picture. Ultimately, your interactions with others give you a mirror with which you can see into your own soul."
scorpio,2014-05-19,"Mistrusting your feelings is your natural reaction while the emotionally detached Aquarius Moon visits your 4th House of Security today. You're uncomfortable when your rational thoughts are all but commanding your heart what to do. And you're particularly vulnerable if you lose touch with your feelings. Finding balance is tricky now because ignoring your passions leads you further from your truth. Nevertheless, take time to reconsider your response before doing something you may instantly regret."
sagittarius,2014-05-19,"Your friends and associates might find it nearly impossible to accept the fact that you're so confident now. They may think something is lurking in the mysterious twilight behind your bright and friendly smile. Luckily, they are wrong. Although profound issues can unexpectedly rise to the surface over the weeks ahead, you are quite capable of handling them on your own. Don't worry about what others think; just be true to yourself and follow your heart."
capricorn,2014-05-19,"Financial uncertainty has crept into your life and nothing you do seems to make sense of your current fiscal picture. Even a simple decision about a straightforward purchase could set you on a path that culminates in the realization that you do not have an endless supply of money. Although you might understand how to manifest abundance now, it may take a while before you have enough cash to buy what you want. Fortunately, your patience is the key to achieving the prosperity you seek."
aquarius,2014-05-19,"Sometimes you don't realize how much of an impact you have on those around you. However, it's useful to contemplate the results of your actions before you undertake something that wastes your time and energy. No matter how good your intentions are now, you still might come on too strong. It's counterproductive to annoy someone who normally supports you. However, you could raise suspicions if you are overly cautious. Your smartest strategy is to acknowledge your own power, but wield it only if necessary."
pisces,2014-05-19,"You are enamored with your own fantasies today as the reflective Moon drifts through your 12th House of Imagination. You might even forget when to return to reality if you get lost in your mind. Although floating off into your dreams is often a rejuvenating activity, you aren't allowed to turn your back on your responsibilities now. Planning a temporary escape to another dimension can work as long as you cover your bases in the real world first."
aries,2014-05-20,"Everywhere you look today there's so much going on, but you thrive on the adrenaline rush anyhow. You feel quite alive as the volume on your life is turned up loud and you feel quite alive. It's a wonder that you can do everything that is expected of you now. In all your busyness, remember to stop long enough to appreciate the beauty around you. A smile in your heart is worth more than lots of words slipping off your tongue. Spread joy not stress."
taurus,2014-05-20,"You might feel panic-struck as you realize you can't tie up all the required loose ends prior to beginning a whole new set of projects. Meanwhile, others may be depending on you to demonstrate your strength of character by following through on your commitments. Breathe deeply to calm your energy; roll up your sleeves and focus on fulfilling your previous obligations before making any new promises. A little determination and elbow grease go a long way."
gemini,2014-05-20,"You can realize your fantasies as long as you remember two things: First, even if your goals seem to be within grasp, it's not going to be all that easy to reach them. Second, some ideas are better left unrealized, for they won't bring satisfaction once they are materialized. Be aware that you always have multiple choices as to which dreams to chase. Choose wisely before you begin your pursuit."
cancer,2014-05-20,"You are receiving weird signals on your psychic radar, but you may not be able to decipher them today. It might seem as if they are somehow coming from your own future, yet remain just barely out of range. Don't struggle trying to make sense of these unintelligible messages. Just show up and listen; keeping your mind open and maintaining awareness is good enough for now."
leo,2014-05-20,"The weeks ahead bring promises of a busier social calendar and more exciting interactions with your friends. Although this sounds like good news, you have to pay attention to all of your relationships now since they can be the source of assumptions that have crept into your life. Don't accept things on face value, especially when it involves love. A meaningful conversation is useful to explore the possibilities before heading off in the wrong direction."
virgo,2014-05-20,"You may be harboring secret illusions about how you want to live your life. Although you could be successfully deceiving yourself, you're probably not fooling anybody else. Take an objective look at your current lifestyle and realign your priorities with your new goals. If necessary, change some of your habits to positively impact your health and increase your vitality. Undoubtedly, you will be happier for it."
libra,2014-05-20,"Your future shines with unrealized potential as the clouds of your imagination dissipate -- or so it seems. Active daydreaming lulls you into the belief that all is copasetic, even when unresolved issues are still present. Enjoyment is still possible as long as you don't lose sight of your long-term goals and the extra effort needed to reach them. Achieving success starts with inspiration yet still requires hard work."
scorpio,2014-05-20,"Circumstances might seem a bit chaotic today, but it feels good to be passionate about your life. However, there might be a voice in your head suggesting that you are missing something important. The good news is it's not an all-or-nothing proposition. Find middle ground where you can celebrate the present moment without feeling as if you are avoiding your more mundane responsibilities."
sagittarius,2014-05-20,"Although you may be committed to creating a future that's more in line with your long-term goals, you might not be ready to talk about what's really important to you yet. For you, communication is often used as a defense mechanism where you keep the conversation -- written or verbal -- in emotionally safe territory. It's not necessary to change your tactics today, but it is wise to be more aware of them so you can make better choices in the present moment."
capricorn,2014-05-20,"A fairly straightforward set of circumstances may get muddled today as you uncharacteristically play the role of Pollyanna. Negativity isn't constructive, but a dose realism will certainly help to bring clarity to the mix. You can get a better idea of what's going on now by asking others for feedback. Listening good good advice and focusing on your options strengthens your current position."
aquarius,2014-05-20,"You could be stressing about a simple misunderstanding that has created an awkward situation. Paradoxically, the more you try to make it right, the worse it becomes. Instead of fixing anything in your outer world today, the solution may be easier to find if you simply alter your own frame of reference. Everything changes when you change your mind."
pisces,2014-05-20,"You're not one to peek ahead to the end of the book; you prefer to take the pages in order and dream about all the possible outcomes on each and every page. However, you might be frustrated now because you may see paths around you coming to an end. Nevertheless, you have an opportunity to decide what's next in your life, rather than grieving over what is slipping away. If unexpected events precipitate change, take this as a signal from the cosmos that these shifts are long overdue."
aries,2014-05-21,"You might be enamored with your dreams these days, but you're also acutely aware that there's more to life than your fantasies with so many incomplete projects demanding your attention. Even if you postpone a deadline for another day or two, you can't escape thinking about the work you have yet to finish. Unfortunately, worrying in advance only creates stress unless you're ready to do something about it now. Don't put off for tomorrow anything that you can do today."
taurus,2014-05-21,"Your down-to-earth reliability earns the respect of your associates, especially if you make a decision today and stand by it. Even if your current ideas are unpopular, your serious demeanor persuades others to consider your point of view because they realize how much thought has gone into your opinion. Nevertheless, picking one solution over another is tricky business now, so give yourself permission to change your mind later on if you are so inclined."
gemini,2014-05-21,"You can't easily calm your wild thoughts because you're busy analyzing every possible repercussion to each and everything you're doing today. Your previous optimism may be flagging because a special opportunity isn't looking quite as appealing now. Intuitively, you know that once you make up your mind you won't be able to go back and undo your decision, so take all the time you need before announcing your final choice. Time is on your side even if you feel rushed in the moment."
cancer,2014-05-21,"People at work probably won't be aware of your stress today because you're able to keep it carefully contained. You might have a very specific notion about what you want your future to look like; however, you may think you're not on the right track. Don't try to talk yourself out of your dreams, even if they make your life more complicated now. Your current self-doubt will soon fade, leaving you to realize that nearly anything is possible once you put your mind to it."
leo,2014-05-21,"You have a very unique point of view today that allows you to surprise others, especially if they expect you to remain inside a traditional box. Ironically, your perspective isn't as radical as it seems at first; it's just that you may overstate your position as you make your case. Although you're quite opinionated, you still should be able to get the support you need now as long as you mix integrity with your passion. Demonstrating your willingness to engage in an open dialogue doesn't mean you have to compromise your values."
virgo,2014-05-21,"You may have an erroneous view of your partner or coworker today that's based on fantasy, yet you're still able to logically justify your conclusions. Thankfully, you have an open mind and are willing to change your thinking as you learn more about the reality of the situation. Although you're tempted to scatter your energy now, you can achieve better results if you concentrate and address the tension in a significant relationship. Resolving interpersonal dynamics allows you to find the time to pursue your other goals, too."
libra,2014-05-21,"Instead of applying all your efforts on your tasks at work, you might wish you could kick back and take it easy today. But you may have to fulfill your responsibilities first, so don't agree to any extra work beyond your regular routine. Your wisest strategy is to minimize your obligations so you can balance your professional duties with a bit of playful abandon. There are no either-or decisions to make now; both aspects of your life contribute to your overall satisfaction."
scorpio,2014-05-21,"Last night's brilliant breakthroughs seem to fade with the glare of the morning light. You might even be hard-pressed to remember your best thoughts unless you took the time to write them down. Don't stress trying to recapture what's been lost. Surrender to the intuitive Pisces Moon with the knowledge that your most solid ideas will resurface in the next few days in a more tangible form. In the meantime, intentional daydreaming enables you to keep the context for your visions alive."
sagittarius,2014-05-21,"Although you may need to show up at work today, you probably prefer remaining cozy in your own home while the dreamy Pisces Moon occupies your 4th House of Security. Nevertheless, once you report for duty and fulfill your obligations, you can return to your private haven, turn off the phone and declare temporary independence from the outside world. For someone who is often the life of the party, hiding out might just be your secret guilty pleasure now."
capricorn,2014-05-21,"There are many small choices to be made in the course of your regular routine today. However, an emotional gulf between you and others may leave you feeling a bit detached and a little lost as the reflective Moon merges with indecisive Neptune in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Even if you say all the right inspirational things, you still might think you're a fraud because you don't see yourself clearly now. Thankfully, your carefully chosen words can be even more effective if you actually believe in them yourself."
aquarius,2014-05-21,"You are full of hope that springs from being true to your values today as the Moon joins idealistic Neptune. But you might also be fearful that your efforts won't be sufficient to improve the current situation. Don't waste precious time doubting your contribution. Transform the energy by focusing on the positive things you can do, instead. Global change is not likely to happen with just the extraordinary work of a few people; it will come from the combined smaller deeds of everyone. Lead by example and see who follows."
pisces,2014-05-21,You are unable to detach yourself from the emotions of everyone around you today as the evocative Moon hooks up with spiritual Neptune in your compassionate sign. It's nearly impossible to find the boundaries that normally separate you from all of humanity and the entire cosmos. Don't bother trying to figure out where your thoughts and feelings are coming from now. You're a psychic sponge for the day; revel in the wisdom that all fish live in the same sea and that individuality isn't as important as it seems.
aries,2014-05-22,"Your desires are pulling you into unknown territory today as you consider a variety of possibilities that stretch out before you. But your life doesn't follow a straightforward path, so you can't just think your way into your future. You're heading toward a major readjustment if you attempt to take on too much now. The sooner you narrow your options and face up to your current responsibilities, the quicker your next adventure will begin."
taurus,2014-05-22,"You may be feeling centered, but you still could hit a rough spot midday when your key planet Venus skids on the uncertainty of Neptune. Even if you're not sure what you want, it might seem as if someone is working against you behind the scenes. Don't attempt to tackle your problems head on, for if you try to bring everything out into the open now, it could take even longer to achieve your goals. Stay as calm as you can and hold your position. Your time for action is drawing near."
gemini,2014-05-22,"Stress remains steady throughout the day and even as you're making progress on one set of issues, another tricky situation pops up on your radar. Fortunately, you can handle the crises one at a time if you pay close attention to your feelings. But don't just act on every hunch; balance your blind optimism with a touch of practical realism. You might feel as if you're trapped and there is no direct avenue to your preferred destination. Rest assured that using force won't help your cause. Acting with finesse increases your chances for a successful negotiation and a satisfying outcome."
cancer,2014-05-22,"Demands being made on you now can bring up unresolved anger issues since you don't like being manipulated by others. It's typically not even your style to respond to an uncomfortable situation directly. Unfortunately, a passive aggressive approach may not produce the desired results. Try a different strategy; avoiding confrontation might be more pleasant in the moment, but it really only delays the inevitable. Take a risk and speak up for your own needs if you want to be acknowledged. The squeaky wheel gets the grease."
leo,2014-05-22,"It seems as if you're much closer today to embarking on a big vacation, even if you know that your budget just won't stretch as far as you want to go. Meanwhile, you're making steady progress with your plans in spite of your fiscal limitations. Don't slip into the time-consuming trap of believing that you must explain your actions to others. Just keep pushing forward, inch by inch, in the pursuit of your dreams."
virgo,2014-05-22,"Pay attention to everything that happens to you today since you may be offered important clues to what to expect over the next couple of weeks. If a friend or partner is acting out of character, look to your own behavior before criticizing anyone else. If you're not living your life according to your ideals and striving to reach your potential, don't be so hard on others who are truly trying to follow their dreams. Integrating external events with your internal process empowers you to make the best choices in the present moment."
libra,2014-05-22,"An open conflict with a coworker can put you in touch with your own issues that you're avoiding. Don't pretend that what's happening is separate from you; this is no time to arbitrarily sidestep a confrontation. Instead, be willing to stand up for your own beliefs now. If you try to gloss over the differences, you'll only have to deal with a more intense version of the same stress later in the month."
scorpio,2014-05-22,"You are traveling familiar ground now, yet you might be inclined to push through the discomfort of change once and for all. You are ready to take a risk to prevent being here again next year. You could have love in a form that you don't want or you want love in a form that you can't seem to find. Either way, the dissatisfaction will ease over the weekend even if you don't initiate any significant action. Nevertheless, proactive behavior works on a deeper level, minimizing the possibility of a re-occurrence of the same dynamic later on."
sagittarius,2014-05-22,"What starts as a difference of opinion can quickly evolve, leading to a productive day filled with creative adventure. Let go of any preconceived notions or old expectations; sticking to your previous agenda won't serve any purpose in the present moment. Instead, focus on cultivating self-expression and appreciating life's little blessings. Your flexibility leads to success faster than your determination. Thankfully, your positive attitude is enough to set the course of events into motion."
capricorn,2014-05-22,"You need to sit down and talk about the source of your discontent in a no-nonsense manner; otherwise you might discover too late that you're past the negotiation stage. However, engaging in outright conflict isn't the wisest plan at this time. Things might not go according to your wishes, and the more you try to control them, the more irritating everything is. Putting your needs out in the open is the first step toward resolution if you can be patient with the process."
aquarius,2014-05-22,"Your core beliefs may be in conflict with those closest to you; however, this divergence doesn't mean that you have to downplay your values or change your mind just to fit in. Additionally, it's not a good idea to try to convince anyone else to adopt your perspective. There are as many different viewpoints as there are roads that lead to Rome. For now, accept the differences and move on. Life would be awfully boring if we were all the same."
pisces,2014-05-22,"Once you have your little meltdown today, it may feel as if the pressure is off you for a while. Unfortunately, this temporary sense of relief doesn't necessarily mean that everything will run smoothly. It takes more than just one outburst to resolve the current emotional dynamics. Initiating an honest discussion enables you to move through your discomfort in a healthier manner. Keeping your emotions close to the surface minimizes the need to lose your temper in the future."
aries,2014-05-23,"Your restlessness might get the best of you today, especially if something intriguing catches your eye. But you could cause an unexpected breakdown in a routine that's working just fine if you move too quickly. Take your time and be your own critic, rather than provoking others to rain on your parade. Follow through with your best ideas, but only after you reconsider each step of your plan in the most practical manner. Better safe than sorry."
taurus,2014-05-23,"It's nearly impossible today to know if you're better off listening to your friends or acting on your own volition without waiting for anyone else's advice. There's no right or wrong way to proceed now; both strategies have their pros and cons. But even if you're absolutely certain you know what you're going to do, it still doesn't hurt to consider another point of view before actually initiating action. Exploring all the possibilities ensures your success."
gemini,2014-05-23,"Your overriding concern today is about your insatiable desire for acknowledgment from your friends and family. You could receive some enthusiastic support for your efforts but it isn't consistent, prompting you to think you might be doing something wrong. Unfortunately, changing your tactics mid-course won't help you win any allies. Just continue doing the best you can without worrying about the judgments of others. You are the source of your best advice now, so listen to your inner wisdom and let your actions speak for themselves."
cancer,2014-05-23,"Even if you have doubts about going on a trip alone, your frustration level might only increase if you wait for someone else to accompany you. People may nod their heads in approval, but they still could back out when the time comes for their participation. Assume that you're on your own today while leaving room for a friend or partner to join in later. Reducing your dependence on others creates a strong foundation for healthier relationships."
leo,2014-05-23,"Nearly everything appears to take longer than you expect now, yet you may see signs that the energy is starting to shift. Nevertheless, instead of impatiently pushing forward today, take time to finish a project that continues to hang over your head. Give yourself a few more days to tie up loose ends before initiating action on your new project. Leaving a job well done enables you to forge ahead with confidence."
virgo,2014-05-23,"You might be so sure of your position today that you bait someone into an argument just to prove your case. Unfortunately, even a casual conversation with a friend could turn tense if you are overly stubborn about your opinion. Wasting energy on debate is only a distraction now. It's not helpful to be arrogant when you would be better off observing the rapidly shifting tides. Improving your current strategy for success is as simple as keeping an open mind."
libra,2014-05-23,"Focusing on details is a smart strategy today as long as you don't miss the overall dynamics of what's occurring in an important relationship. If something happens out of the blue, consider it as a reminder from the universe to pay close attention to your feelings because repressed emotions are now likely to zap you unexpectedly. Address an uncomfortable issue as soon as you see it coming rather than waiting until the tension disrupts your day. You might surprise others with your direct approach, but everyone will appreciate it in the long run."
scorpio,2014-05-23,"You may unilaterally declare this a day to be one of fun and relaxation, only to discover that there's still something else left undone. Keep in mind that you don't have to run out on your responsibilities to create time to enjoy the fruits of your labor. Even if you can't get away for long, at least plan on partaking in a pleasurable activity that's not associated with any sort of enduring accomplishment. Give yourself permission to feel the joy that can be found in the present moment."
sagittarius,2014-05-23,"Your sense of anticipation is growing, but you still might not know what's around the next corner. You could successfully talk yourself out of your excitement today, only to feel the adrenaline rush again a little later. Stop attempting to resist the future; reclaim the optimism that you recently set aside to focus on pressing issues. A more positive attitude is an invitation to a whole new range of possibilities."
capricorn,2014-05-23,"You could be caught off guard today by the intensity of your feelings. Although you are optimistic about your recent choices, you still might run into a serious roadblock that tests your determination. Slow down so you can navigate through the obstacle course without giving up. The road clears ahead if you have the sense to push forward with unflappable resolve and unwavering faith."
aquarius,2014-05-23,"You might be feeling anxious now if you can't decide how to spend your time. However, the pressure to choose is a symptom of the larger issues in your life that require you to balance your irrepressible dreams with a more realistic acceptance of what's ahead. Instead of believing that you can do whatever you want, moderate your expectations to avoid disappointment later in the day. Focus on what you can change rather than what's out of reach."
pisces,2014-05-23,"Hopefully, you have already taken time to check in with your own needs, instead of being totally distracted by everyone else's. However, your period of self-reflection is rapidly drawing to a close, and you must make a decision that will guide you through the weeks ahead. Stop looking over your shoulder and wondering what you could have done differently. Aim for the stars and imagine all that you can possibly do in the future, instead."
aries,2014-05-24,"Your recent encounter with your own emotional vulnerability may have left you a bit rattled. However, you're ready to face your fears today and overcome them once and for all. Somber Saturn is your ally now, defining what is out of bounds and what is within reach. Instead of running helter-skelter all over the map, settle into the present moment and remain open to feeling what's in your heart. Sometimes being true to yourself takes work."
taurus,2014-05-24,"You're growing tired of the push-me-pull-you games that are clouding the dynamics of your relationships these days. Fortunately, you may be offered a way out today, so you don't have to go around again and again. The solution won't likely come from choosing one extreme or the other. Instead, your current differences of opinion might become insignificant when you focus on the long-term goals instead of fleeting satisfaction. Sharing your dreams helps you discover common ground."
gemini,2014-05-24,"Doing your chores may be a bit tedious today because of the hard work required. Unfortunately, avoiding them doesn't make much sense now since you can't enjoy socializing with your friends this weekend until your obligations are fulfilled. Fortunately, finding a steady production pace that you can maintain throughout the day will be handsomely rewarded with ample time off later."
cancer,2014-05-24,"You're not the least bit interested in taking the easy way out today, since you might doubt your abilities unless you can meet other people's expectations. Nevertheless, you may feel so weary of struggling that you surrender to someone else's assumptions about you, leaving little room left over for your creative self-expression. Thankfully, propitious Jupiter is on your side now, so you should be able to find time for everything, including your personal growth. Don't give up; finding your own voice could reveal a promising new path to your future."
leo,2014-05-24,"Unfulfilled family commitments may return in an unexpected manner today. Perhaps you mistakenly thought that the old business was already wrapped up, only to discover that there's another round of work that's expected of you. A bit of intense concentration could ultimately offer you more freedom than you realize. You're being given a second chance to demonstrate your reliability, so take it and prove that you're the leader of the pack."
virgo,2014-05-24,"It seems as if you're tied to the clock today, with very little flexibility to adapt to someone else's schedule. However, you probably have to make adjustments anyway, even if changing your plans adds layers of complications. Nevertheless, don't hesitate to ask for help if you need it. Just be ready to say yes if your guardian angel arrives to offer assistance. Don't let your pride get in the way of your success."
libra,2014-05-24,"The reality of your financial situation is such that you might not have much choice when it comes to selecting your work hours. You can't afford to miss a chance to increase your income today, whether it's generated by a new project or just an unexpected bump in your business. Luckily, adopting a serious demeanor could lead to a fresh perspective and a brand new way of looking at your options. In any event, thinking outside of the box improves your chances for success."
scorpio,2014-05-24,"You may feel restrained by circumstances beyond your control, but paradoxically this can also be quite reassuring. Unlike some of your peers, knowing and working with unalterable limitations makes you feel surprisingly safe now. Your life has a purpose today, even if it's simply to focus your efforts on resolving the situation at hand. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to loosen up enough to enjoy yourself. All work and no play is not a viable solution."
sagittarius,2014-05-24,"Even your closest friends could misunderstand your intentions today. You're not making it any easier for them now because you're unlikely to tell them everything they need to know. You aren't trying to make the situation any more complicated; it's just that you are afraid to share things about yourself that might be uncomfortable for others to hear. Nevertheless, taking a calculated risk should pay off if you balance your optimism with a healthy dose of practical realism. Spill the beans and hope for the best."
capricorn,2014-05-24,"Sometimes you feel as if you don't fit into your family or community, and that others have trouble understanding your serious approach to life. However, you might be surprised with the generous support you receive now, making it easier for you to be part of the fun. If you are offered a chance to participate in a group activity, don't let a previous bad experience ruin the day. You have power over your thoughts, so allow old fears to morph into today's enthusiasm. Make the most of the moment and embrace the current opportunities; they won't wait at your door forever."
aquarius,2014-05-24,"Whatever you think your current role is in the outer world, you may be afraid that you aren't making your mark today. You're likely to overcompensate for your career-related insecurities now by glossing over your shortcomings or failures. But don't be afraid to silence your doubts by thinking big and acting even bigger. Grandiose plans could actually be your key to success now if you're willing to show up and do your part."
pisces,2014-05-24,"Although you may be naturally cautious, you're especially eager to make the most of today's amazing potential. Jolly Jupiter is currently journeying through your 5th House of Playful Self-Expression, inspiring you to share the brighter side of life with anyone who will listen. Instead of just repeating all the excuses you have to say no, it's your time to step forward and say yes. Your success is contagious; following your bliss empowers others to do the same."
aries,2014-05-25,"Although you want to be part of the fun today, you would rather march in front of the parade rather than get lost in the crowd. You're feeling your oats, but just because witty Mercury gives you an extra sharp tongue now doesn't mean you have to use it at the expense of someone else. Unfortunately, your current tendency toward excessive behavior can land you in trouble unless you think before you speak. Soften your message so others don't have to cover their ears and miss out on what you are saying."
taurus,2014-05-25,"You aren't very happy if you are the brunt of someone's sarcasm, but defending yourself may be a common event with your stubborn nature. However, you might not be that comfortable responding to this particular situation today. Sometimes it just easier to hide your anger than to confront the origin of the problem. Keep in mind that this is not a cowardly act. Your self-restraint is a sign of wisdom now; otherwise you could lose control and complicate matters instead of leaving well enough alone."
gemini,2014-05-25,"You need to stay vigilant or your intensity starts to sound overly aggressive to others. You might even believe that you are extremely logical today, only to have someone inform you that your ideas are all-but-impossible to follow. Instead of explaining every little detail, speak softer and say less. You really don't have to use that many words now to get your point across. But you may have to wait a little longer before your message is completely understood."
cancer,2014-05-25,"You might surprise everyone with your ability to fight for your choices today. You may be willing to listen, but once you've heard what someone else has to offer, your reaction can be strong and swift. Even if you grow more aware of the opinions of others now, be careful about diluting the strength of your message. Attempting to cover too much unfamiliar ground all at once won't get you very far; narrow your focus and speak from your heart."
leo,2014-05-25,"Expressing your creative ideas isn't an alien concept to you, but today there is so much positive energy floating around that you might not know when to stop. Your confidence tempts you to be so bold that you can easily offend even your strongest allies. Things will go more smoothly if you remember that pompous Jupiter's magnifying lens is making everything you say sound more important than it actually is. A laid-back approach will take you further now than an arrogant one. Save the drama for another day."
virgo,2014-05-25,Your interactions may seem to be emotionally volatile now that you are approaching a real turning point in a relationship. Someone's negative thoughts might boil over and then everything becomes quiet. But don't mistake less noise for less intensity; it could be just the opposite. Don't allow yourself to feel so much anger that you say things you don't really mean. Withdraw your energy until you have regained your strength and composure. Reclaiming your center is as simple as changing your attitude and listening to your heart.
libra,2014-05-25,"You can be such a people-pleaser that sometimes you become overly concerned with making everyone else happy at your own expense. But the impulsive Aries Moon bumps into radical Uranus and loving Venus today, indicating that you could suddenly blurt out something straight from your heart without thinking about the impact of your words. It's not your intention to hurt anyone, but at the same time you have to take care of yourself. Setting well-defined boundaries assures healthier relationships in the future."
scorpio,2014-05-25,"You're finally motivated to begin new projects now with so many planets visiting your 6th House of Work. Unfortunately, completing what you start can become a problem if you don't keep up the momentum, especially if people distract you with their own agendas. You may lose track of your direction if you slow down today, so ask your friends and family to either lend a helping hand or simply get out of your way. Anything is possible if you set your mind to it."
sagittarius,2014-05-25,"Even if your current message sounds critical, don't expect others to automatically drop everything and share your concern today. Although your friends know that you can wax philosophical, they still grow less patient if you enthusiastically ramble on about something that's significant only to you. Your ideas are flowing fast and furiously now but it's hard to tell which ones are worth pursuing. Don't grow too attached to any one thought until you see how it stands up to the test of time."
capricorn,2014-05-25,"Wielding your power is exhilarating today, but you could easily overdo it. The idea of proving your authority can be so enticing that you may lose sight of your original intentions. However, success doesn't stem from being in absolute control; reaching your goals is dependent on cooperation and innovation now, and not hierarchy and tradition. Inventor and visionary Buckminster Fuller defined synergy as the whole being greater than the sum of its individual parts."
aquarius,2014-05-25,"Positive thinking is the single most powerful force that can motivate others, but you might take its intensity too far today. Blind optimism isn't useful because if others believe that you can't discern facts from fiction, there's a good chance that they will lose faith in your entire message. Muster support for your plan by being as realistic as possible when sharing the details. Everyone wants to hear good news, but it's even more essential to tell the truth."
pisces,2014-05-25,"You're eager to create new strategies for increasing your income while the enterprising Aries Moon travels through your 2nd House of Money. You may have a lot of brilliant ideas today about how to improve your cash flow, but you're not sure that any of them will actually work. Keep in mind that dreamy Neptune's long-term presence in your sign can drain your confidence now, so don't be afraid to ask for support from others. Relying on good advice from a trustworthy ally helps you determine a sensible course of action."
aries,2014-05-26,Today's focus shifts away from your need to express your desires while the concern for establishing more stability in your life now moves to the front burner. The best way to ensure success is to build a solid foundation first. Handle your current responsibilities as sensibly as possible without waiting for a more opportune time. Finishing your chores in the morning allows you to relax with a clear conscience later in the day.
taurus,2014-05-26,"If the recent hectic pace has left you off-balance, today may bring welcome relief as the Moon's return to your sign gives you a renewed sense of certainty. Taking time to hang out with friends and family enables you to moderate the hyperactivity and find your way back to a mellower existence. You're in your own element now, so soak in the positive vibrations while you can."
gemini,2014-05-26,"Your morning begins on an uplifting note as social networking lures you away from more serious matters. However, later in the day, you may not be as eager to waste time on endless phone calls, emails or text messages. You might need a bit of solitude now so you can concentrate on what's really important. Sometimes even you lighthearted Twins crave more meaning in your life, so don't be afraid to explore your heart to figure out what you want."
cancer,2014-05-26,"Even if you have big ideas for a family celebration today, you may tire quickly of such thoughts when you realize how much effort your social ambitions require. It's not that you're lazy or unmotivated; it's just that you need to be as practical as possible about your expectations. Take extra time planning all the logistics; you won't make a wrong decision if you consider all available options before committing to one direction. Celebrate life's blessings no matter what else you do."
leo,2014-05-26,"You need to shine your light brightly in all that you do today, making it difficult to completely relax even in the lighter moments. Your drive for excellence isn't negotiable now, but others could become annoyed with your persistence anyhow. However, it doesn't really matter what anyone else thinks of you; what counts is how you judge yourself. Nevertheless, as long as you don't compromise your integrity, a little flexibility on your part may be just what the doctor ordered to soothe everyone's nerves."
virgo,2014-05-26,"Your mood greatly improves as you slide into a groove of productivity this afternoon. Naturally, it feels good to deliver on whatever you promise; it's even better to know that you are doing your job really well. But efficiency isn't enough for you now. Your current happiness also depends upon your ability to surround yourself with beauty and love. Paradoxically, the positive energy you experience originates within your own heart."
libra,2014-05-26,"You instinctively know today what is beautiful and what is not as your key planet Venus graces you with even sharper aesthetic judgment than normal. Unfortunately, it may be challenging to justify your sense of style without becoming overly critical of others. Remember, you don't need anyone to agree with you; your taste stands on its own. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder so channel your passion into creative pursuits, instead."
scorpio,2014-05-26,"People may seem inflexible today as they go about their regular business. It's frustrating when your suggestions fall upon deaf ears. Instead of wasting time trying to have meaningful discussions with others who aren't even interested, gently withdraw from unnecessary dialogue unless you are asked for your opinion. Be brief when explaining your position; using extra words only creates unnecessary stress now. Silence is golden if it means you can concentrate on your work with a singular focus."
sagittarius,2014-05-26,"Whoever thinks that you Archers aren't industrious should stand back and just watch you in action today because you could demonstrate the true meaning of going the extra mile. No matter what, you are determined to come across with the goods and do something special. If you told someone that you would take responsibility for a particular task, then don't let anyone charm you out of doing the right thing. Your integrity is on the line now, so stop talking and get to work."
capricorn,2014-05-26,"You're willing to work diligently for what you want today, even if you have to shake things up a bit along the way. Luckily, your desire for profound change is supported by a harmonizing lunar aspect to transformational Pluto in your ambitious sign. Although others might resist your efforts at first, you're not likely to take no for an answer. Make adjustments to your strategy as needed while keeping your eyes on your goal. Your calculated persistence will wear down the opposition in the end."
aquarius,2014-05-26,"Your friends and family may show up with extra support today, yet it might be challenging to accept it graciously. You could be caught off guard with the realization that people think you need help, but don't let your ego get in the way. Deal with your insecurities as efficiently as possible and remain open to sincere offers of assistance. Letting others contribute to your success is a winning proposition for all."
pisces,2014-05-26,"There's no reason to be in a hurry this morning since your day begins like a freight train, moving very slowly at first and then steadily picking up steam. If you attempt to start out too fast, you could quickly run into an obstacle and then have to backtrack to get it right. However, quick fixes won't solve any problems today. You must look at the entire system and approach the solution holistically for it to be of lasting value. Putting your shoulder to the wheel is not for the weak-of-heart, but the rewards are great if your determination is strong."
aries,2014-05-27,"The real magic is not found in the supernatural world today; you can experience it in the meaningful connections you make with others. But don't expect to be buzzing with excitement. Instead of seeking something mysterious beyond the senses, concentrate on the more mundane aspects of your current relationships. Too much searching now blinds your eyes from the most extraordinary things that are right in front of your nose."
taurus,2014-05-27,"Allowing your moods to rise and fall with their own natural rhythm is your best strategy now, since the Moon's visit to your sign amplifies the intensity of your emotional reactions. Although your feelings may ebb and flow with greater uncertainty than you wish today, you're only pulled off balance if you resist the current flow. Your best bet is to hold off on making any long-term decisions until the energy settles down. You can't control every aspect of your life, but you can control how you respond."
gemini,2014-05-27,"You may have important secrets to keep, yet even a tiny glimpse of the bigger picture now can shift your perspective and convince you that it's time to talk. Your unconventional approach might be exactly what's needed to catch others off guard today. Take advantage of your window of opportunity to present your case in the best possible light and be open to where the conversation leads you. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
cancer,2014-05-27,"Social activities can be emotionally healing today, especially if you're gently nurtured by your friends. However, accepting what is offered may be challenging, but showing your vulnerability might be just the right thing to do. There's really no need to put up artificial walls in order to protect yourself from those who love you the most. The first step to creating true intimacy is to open your heart and let others in."
leo,2014-05-27,"Although taking some time off today sounds like a good idea, you might not want to turn down an exciting opportunity to assume a leadership role. Whether you take charge at work or at home, others are likely to appreciate your guidance as long as you don't act like a prima donna. Thankfully, you can be even more effective now by working behind the scenes or quietly off to the side. You don't have to be the star of the show in order to inspire others with your spirit of generosity."
virgo,2014-05-27,"If you recently postponed an important decision, grab the chance to clearly state your preference today. The practical energy from the earthy Taurus Moon gives you the ability to be decisive in a manner that creates lasting relevance. Don't be distracted by your tumultuous emotions now; the best way to keep your balance in the present moment is to focus on the distant horizon."
libra,2014-05-27,"Although you may be in touch with your inner voice of reason today, you are still tempted to indulge in pleasure if given the opportunity. You could consider all your options and make the most responsible choice, only to toss logic to the wind at the very last moment. Fortunately, staying aware of your current spontaneous inclinations might be enough to prevent you from acting unconsciously. It's not difficult to do the right thing now if you just acknowledge your impulsive desires without automatically letting them control your life."
scorpio,2014-05-27,"A stubborn associate who is satisfied with his or her current situation can stand in the way of your happiness today. It's hard to break out of a current relationship pattern, especially if it's meeting some of your basic needs. Normally, achieving stability is a positive accomplishment in your world. However, maintaining the status quo now can prevent you from taking the next step. Don't worry if your breakthrough doesn't happen yet; things will change when the moment is ripe."
sagittarius,2014-05-27,"A return to your regular routine makes the most sense now, but you might not be willing to give up on your dream of embarking on a journey of some kind. Nevertheless, it seems as if you are running out of time and can't get away with wasting your energy on non-productive activities. Luckily, with the right attitude, even the most boring chore can suddenly transform into its own adventure."
capricorn,2014-05-27,You're blessed because you can find fulfillment today from the simplest of pleasures. Your needs are not complicated now and satisfaction is certainly within reach. But you won't achieve your long-term goals if you just continue to aimlessly drift through the day. Establish your desired destination and then move with purpose in that direction.
aquarius,2014-05-27,"You might prefer staying home and laying low today. However, you may have to head out into the real world even if you're not ready for another round of work. Instead of getting caught up in your disappointment, stand up to the challenges of the day with fierce resolve. Fortunately, you can have the best of both worlds by taking care of your obligations first and creating some quiet time for relaxation later. You have the power to improve your day by simply changing your attitude."
pisces,2014-05-27,"You could be uncharacteristically stubborn in your thinking today and unwilling to change your mind. People may be surprised if you're not as agreeable as usual to bend your personal agenda to meet their needs. However, you're not required to explain your motives in detail, so just kindly tell others that you already have your own plans and then get busy with what makes your heart happy. Some adventures are meant for you alone."
aries,2014-05-28,"Your dilemma seems quite real today, even if you're feeling confident of your decision-making abilities. You think that you know what you want and it doesn't appear too complicated but the Gemini New Moon occurs in your 3rd House of Information, scattering your thoughts and confusing your priorities. Achieving satisfaction isn't as easy as it sounds because there's a big difference between your personal goals and what others have to offer at this time. Your current happiness depends on your willingness to modify your highest ideals with what is actually possible."
taurus,2014-05-28,"Your physical energy may be low today, leaving you to feel a bit discouraged. Perhaps your smartest strategy now is to simply take it easy and recharge your batteries. The breezy Gemini New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Resources, making it tough to tackle a significant project. Don't waste too much time worrying about your lack of progress; your stamina should return soon enough. In the meantime, increase your chances for future success by getting some much-needed rest and relaxation."
gemini,2014-05-28,"You are very aware that your emotions are affecting your productivity today as the flighty New Moon buzzes your 1st House of Personality. Your feelings shift with the breeze, making it nearly impossible to settle into your work. Your moods may continue to fluctuate, challenging you to maintain a calm demeanor. Minimize your frustration and avoid being overwhelmed by only taking on what you know you can finish. Limiting your goals now makes room for spiritual growth."
cancer,2014-05-28,"You may be so sensitive today that you feel under the weather for no particular reason. However, it's crucial not to succumb to negativity with the Gemini New Moon falling in your 12th House of Spirituality, since circumstances are probably not as bad as they currently seem. Above all, remain honest; any attempts to stretch the truth will only backfire now. However, sharing your fantasies with a trustworthy friend can be an uplifting experience as long as you clearly differentiate your dreams from the facts."
leo,2014-05-28,"No matter how great you feel about your prospects today, your usual demonstration of courage and vitality may still be difficult to pull off as the Gemini New Moon muddies your 11th House of Community. Unfortunately, positive energy isn't as readily available now. Ironically, bringing your self-doubt right out into the open can turn the day around. Others are more likely to offer a helping hand once you stop pretending that you have all the answers."
virgo,2014-05-28,"Although you may be operating on information overload, Neptune's square to the Gemini New Moon in your 10th House of Public Responsibility makes it difficult to tell which data is useful to your career plans and which is not. It might even be impossible to discern fact from fiction now. Naturally, you want to deal with the real world based upon objective truth; however, your fuzzy thinking gets in the way of your progress today. Soften your stance and don't push for clarity where there is none. The seeds of your next success story must be planted in your imagination first."
libra,2014-05-28,"You may grow more optimistic in thought and lighter on your feet as the day unfolds. However, you also might become confused about your future plans as the Gemini New Moon highlights your 9th House of Big Ideas. Unfortunately, you're less able to tell what's real and what is imagined today. Your thoughts come and go quickly now, so don't worry if you can't hold on to any of them. Attempting to control your mental meandering is an exercise in futility. Instead, drift along with the currents and enjoy the day for whatever joy and inspiration it brings."
scorpio,2014-05-28,"You might actually believe you can logically think your way around a current dilemma, but reason seems to break down just as the solution comes into sight. For now, it is practical reality versus creative imagination as the clever Gemini New Moon lands in your 8th House of Transformation; it's difficult to hold on to both sides at the same time. Give yourself permission to entertain your dreams today, since they are a catalyst for the positive change you seek."
sagittarius,2014-05-28,"You are being flooded by vivid images arising from your subconscious today. But you may feel as if a friend or partner is pushing you to do something that doesn't really fit into your notion of reality. Someone might stir your anxiety as the inquisitive Gemini New Moon activates your 7th House of Companions. The more you try to figure out what it all means, the farther away the answers seem. Don't take your lack of clarity too seriously, for it will pass soon enough. In the meantime, open your mind and enjoy the show."
capricorn,2014-05-28,"People usually trust your answers because you have plenty of common sense and seem to know exactly what to do in a time of crisis. However, you may be unclear about where to place your efforts as deceptive Neptune clouds today's Gemini New Moon in your 6th House of Work. Your lack of confidence could lead you down the path of less resistance, which isn't necessarily your intended direction. Allow yourself the luxury of wasting a little time now, even if it feels counterproductive. Your best solutions come when you're not looking for them."
aquarius,2014-05-28,"Although you may be quick to leap out of bed and prepare for work today, something in the back of your mind could still be bothering you. Even if you don't know what's expected of you, the mischievous Gemini New Moon's presence in your 5th House of Self-Expression is a cosmic reminder that you can be extremely creative if you let go of the details for a while. If you refuse to relinquish control, you could inadvertently invite unnecessary irritation. However, remaining open to change leads to rich and meaningful experiences."
pisces,2014-05-28,"There's no need to panic today, even if you don't have your full game plan in place yet. In fact, expressing your fears might just make matters worse as the chatty Gemini New Moon culminates in your 4th House of Emotional Security. Unfortunately, you're not fully in control of your immediate environment; the more you try to force something to go your way, the more resistance you encounter. Attempting to resolve an issue could make your frustration level soar; trust your psychic radar and just float through the uncertainty for a while longer."
aries,2014-05-29,"It's time to break free from any old habits that no longer serve you. You've been on the verge of change for a while and now you might be worrying that you missed your window of opportunity. Don't succumb to unnecessary discouragement; instead, shake up some of the more mundane aspects of your day just to create some much-needed excitement. A sudden rush of adrenaline could be enough to kick-start the next phase of your life."
taurus,2014-05-29,"You can waste too much time today wondering if everything is okay because something that you usually take for granted may be less certain now. You might be hesitant to build anything because it feels like the sand is shifting beneath your feet. The good news is that your foundation is more stable and solid than you think. Try not to be overly concerned about issues that won't ultimately matter, for your insecurity will pass and your confidence will return when you start trusting the process."
gemini,2014-05-29,"Your imagination has a life of its own now that the evocative Moon is back for her monthly visit to your sign. You may find it challenging to separate your feelings from what is actually best for you, leaving you less concerned with the undeniable facts and more enamored with the endless possibilities. Don't make any final decisions before thinking your whole plan through one more time. Every fantasy doesn't have to become real."
cancer,2014-05-29,You have fantastic ideas but it will still take considerable effort to execute your plans. It's not that your goals are so grandiose that they are unattainable; it's just that you tend to adopt a more thoughtful and methodical approach. Carve out a bit of time to reconsider what you really want to do now before moving in your chosen direction. There's no reason to rush the journey when there is so much at stake.
leo,2014-05-29,"There is considerable pressure in your life these days, even if you hide it well. However, you may be less inclined to keep everything to yourself today. Thankfully, supportive friends come to the rescue, whether or not they realize how much you needed help. Temporary peace is yours if you allow yourself to be distracted from your deeper concerns for a while. Your little escape enables you to return to your unfinished business feeling refreshed and ready to meet the challenges ahead."
virgo,2014-05-29,"What appears to be a professional setback at first could actually be an unexpected opportunity to make improvements on your plans. You might not see the details clearly now, but the passing weeks will give you a different perspective on what's going on. Don't fight so hard against the resistance, for it's probably based more on your fears than on reality. Thankfully, your practical and patient nature saves the day."
libra,2014-05-29,"Your interpretation of what someone says may be a bit distorted today since your fantasies are coloring your thoughts. It can be frustrating if you attempt to stay in the logical realms, for your imagination demands to be included in the process now. Contrary to what others are telling you, working harder isn't always the answer. Paradoxically, giving yourself permission to daydream actually helps you accomplish your tasks in a more innovative manner."
scorpio,2014-05-29,"Your directional bearings cannot be found by analyzing a map today, for no one else has traveled along your path. Your road through life is for your steps alone and it's not realistic to expect others to make it easier for you now. But if you are inventing your own reality there's no time for you to fall asleep at the wheel. Paying close attention to what's in front of you increases your chances of successfully reaching your destination on time."
sagittarius,2014-05-29,"Managing your relationships requires extra vigilance these days. However, an unexpected twist can turn your day upside down, but a surprise can also set you free. Your logic may be somewhat clouded now, so put off the big decisions for a while longer. In the meantime, remain flexible to the needs of others. Ultimately, let your dreams be your guide as you explore the possible paths ahead."
capricorn,2014-05-29,"You practical Goats prefer solid footing beneath your feet, so it's unsettling now when the very things you were most sure of start to disintegrate before your eyes. Don't panic; it isn't like your life is falling apart. The problem is your internal GPS isn't operating at top efficiency, so you may have to fly by the seat of your pants for a while. Loosen up and enjoy the ride -- even if you have no idea where you are going."
aquarius,2014-05-29,"There's a fresh breeze blowing into your life now, but you must open your windows to notice it. However, you are distracted by everything that's potentially pleasurable, so it could require a conscious decision to let in the deeper emotional issues. You may not choose to experience the day in a particularly intense manner, but you can still sense the storm building on the horizon. Have fun today without stressing about tomorrow, for it will arrive soon enough."
pisces,2014-05-29,"Thinking about your home and family in radical new ways may offer a unique solution to an ongoing predicament. Even so, transformation won't likely happen overnight, so try not to make too much of a fuss about what is going on now. Although your personal lens on reality might make things seem different than they actually are, closing your eyes won't make the problem go away. Truth works better than denial if you really want to create positive change."
aries,2014-05-30,"You could grow tired of listening to the sound of your own voice today. Even if you start out talking fast, you might think it's wiser to say nothing at all once the Moon slips into cautious Cancer. However, keeping secrets can be as problematic as sharing too much information. There's no reason to fuel a melodrama that evolves from an all-or-nothing strategy. Minimize the internal tug-of-war by finding a middle path that doesn't go to extremes."
taurus,2014-05-30,"Your concerns about money may turn a delightful day into one riddled with angst. Luckily, it helps to remember that some things are simply out of your control, including how much cash you have on hand today. Nevertheless, you're responsible for specific behaviors that can immediately impact the current situation. Adopting a more conservative approach ensures that you'll have what you need tomorrow. A penny saved is a penny earned."
gemini,2014-05-30,"You might not feel very cooperative today, even though you care deeply for your friends and associates. You want everyone to be successful at whatever they choose to do, but you prefer to keep things low-key now and not share your feelings. Although saving your energy may be a smart strategy, it doesn't hurt to simply nod your head in approval so others at least know that you heard what was said. Just be sure to take some time alone so you can sort out your thoughts before jumping into your next group project."
cancer,2014-05-30,"You have a clever way with words today and might choose to hide your uncertainties behind a mask of humor. The reflective Moon's return to your contemplative sign this morning may raise doubts about your chosen path. Unfortunately, your desire to acquire something beautiful could create its own complicated story. Postpone a non-essential purchase and focus on building trust, instead. Strengthening your relationships can greatly improve the quality of your life."
leo,2014-05-30,"Attending to practical issues at work today takes precedence over encouraging the whimsical dreams of others. Although you still might want to help a friend turn a fantasy into reality, don't let your concentration on the material world drift off. You may need to set aside some of your big-hearted generosity in order to get serious about meeting your own objectives. Take care of your business first so you can offer your unwavering support later on."
virgo,2014-05-30,"You know exactly what needs to be done today, but you might be paralyzed with the fear of doing something wrong. You probably have taken on a lot of responsibility at work, but when you return home later, you still must handle unfinished domestic chores. Don't let all your running around being busy distract you from the important personal growth that demands your attention. Your desire for perfection doesn't have to get in the way of your happiness."
libra,2014-05-30,"Your romantic dreams motivate you to take drastic action today so you don't end up stuck in a world of illusions without achieving success. But accomplishing your goals may not bring you the recognition you want or the love you seek. Being swept up in an exciting flurry of emotions is invigorating, yet it's still crucial to refocus on your core beliefs now before discovering that you're heading off in the wrong direction. Navigating with your moral compass will lead you exactly where you want to go."
scorpio,2014-05-30,"Your strong reaction to a family discussion today could carry you off into tumultuous waters. Although you might prefer to sidestep a direct confrontation and move on, you can feel your emotions gaining in strength and you know something will have to give. Naturally, it's healthier to express your concerns before they become serious issues. Resolve your differences quickly and defuse a potential conflict before it reaches a critical state. Clearing the air is beneficial to everyone involved."
sagittarius,2014-05-30,"You may have a variety of things to do today, yet it's essential that you keep up the appearance of being a strong leader at work and at home. However, you might not know the exact recipe to make this happen. Forget about the how-to book filled with step-by-step instructions. Instead, reclaim your power by trusting your instincts and being your authentic self. You don't have to have all the answers to be an inspiration to others."
capricorn,2014-05-30,"Your current dilemma pits your need for independence against your desire for relationship security. Unfortunately, there aren't any quick fixes to your deep cravings for a more meaningful and spiritual connection. You may long to rediscover the missing magic that you set aside to climb a corporate or social ladder. Instead of expecting everything to fall into place today, simply focus on the most immediate tasks and leave the bigger issues for another day. There's no sense in worrying about things you can't change anyway."
aquarius,2014-05-30,"Keeping up with all the social activities going on around you leaves you slightly out of breath. However, it's time to slow down now and reconnect with the more mundane aspects of your existence. But don't bother making big plans and looking too far ahead, or you'll just end up in a state of confusion today. Save the dreaming for another day while you focus on the current daily grind. Sometimes, counting your blessings is enough to remind you of all the joy in your life."
pisces,2014-05-30,"Someone might not approve of what you are doing, but you have no clue why. The more you investigate, the more convoluted the whole situation becomes. You may be ready to give up now and simply let the winds of change carry you wherever they will. Unfortunately, your current obligations prevent you from escaping because other people are counting on you today and you can't just run out on them. Just keep doing your best without wasting energy trying to please everyone else."
aries,2014-05-31,"There's not much that will get in your way today. Even if a mountain suddenly appeared between you and the finish line, you might not notice the insurmountable obstacle -- where others would just throw in the towel and go home. However, a new set of problems may arise from your unwillingness to face the facts. Being realistic now is wiser than operating under a false sense of confidence. Even positive thinking can be taken too far."
taurus,2014-05-31,"You have more than enough energy to finish what you start today; you may even feel as if you're at the top of your game. But something might be happening in your life now that you don't quite understand. Be careful as you move into the shadows, where it's challenging to see things in their true light. Don't let distractions pull you off track; if you stick with the concrete facts, you can effectively steer clear of the negativity or confusion that uncertainty brings. Keep it simple if you want to reach your destination on time."
gemini,2014-05-31,"Many of the situations in your life seem to be beyond your control now. It's as if circumstances are driving your car instead of you. But you can be the hero that saves the day if you honor your own feelings and embrace that which you don't fully understand. If this sounds like a contradiction, then you are already on your way to solving one of the current unsolvable mysteries of your life."
cancer,2014-05-31,"Unpleasant circumstances can force an issue between you and your partner -- a romantic companion, a family member or a coworker. Whoever it is, it might seem like your ideas are being stifled, but you won't idly sit this one out. You feel the need to defend your prerogative to speak on your own behalf. This is no time to be shy; make sure everyone knows where you stand. Expressing what's in your heart is less risky now than remaining silent."
leo,2014-05-31,"Strong desires can prompt you to spread your cards on the table in an attempt to attract what you want. But you might have missed a trick today, for your play doesn't necessarily bring you the results you were seeking, even if you get pretty close. Run your game plan through an extra round of analysis with someone you trust before putting it into motion. Reviewing all your options one last time is worth it when so much is at stake."
virgo,2014-05-31,"Although your feet are firmly planted on the ground, your feelings are being pulled in several directions. You can talk yourself into things you would normally dismiss as unrealistic. However, today you're willing to believe that anything is possible. Even if it is, don't try to convince yourself that you have super powers. Accept your limitations and you won't get in over your head. Fortunately, you can still ride to the rescue in your human form."
libra,2014-05-31,"Conflict may arrive at your doorstep today in the form of unrealistic demands. It may feel as if people are expecting you to do or say things that are just not part of your original agenda. Go ahead and surprise others with your decisive behavior, but don't waste valuable energy defending your right to choose how to spend your time. Just remember that acting for the good of all doesn't mean you always have to set your needs aside to please someone else."
scorpio,2014-05-31,"You may be pretty sure that your perceptions are right on target today and you're willing to go out on a limb to make your point. However, you're not interested in wasting your time lost in endless discussions about your plans. Swift action now speaks louder than philosophical debate that only delays the inevitable. Unfortunately, you still might have to manage a situation that stems from an unexpected response to your behavior. Address issues when they arise as efficiently as you can without taking responsibility for other people's reactions."
sagittarius,2014-05-31,"If you're in some type of sales or public relations work, you might as well go for the whole enchilada today. If you believe in what you're selling now, the sky is the limit and you can even bend reality in your favor. This is a wonderful opportunity to make substantial progress toward achieving your goals, but be careful not to abuse your power in the process. Misrepresentation of the truth for personal gain is frowned upon by the planets. Anything is possible as long as you play by the rules."
capricorn,2014-05-31,"You have your own personal agenda today, but you might not want to undertake a new path on your own. Thankfully, you're able to tease the truth out of a complex array of facts and fictions. But if you believe in fairy tales, you could find yourself struggling to return to reality later on. On the other hand, if you keep one foot on the ground, you're more likely to find someone to collaborate with on a dream project. Your success depends on your ability to keep it real."
aquarius,2014-05-31,"Even if the focus of your life is on your public image now, you have some very real concerns that you might be keeping to yourself. However, there's no need to hide your feelings from those you love. Once your erratic emotions are off your chest, you're ready to settle down and get to work. Although your disclosure might mess with other people's expectations, being truthful about your uncertainty ultimately contributes to making your relationships more stable."
pisces,2014-05-31,"Your physical stamina can pack quite a punch today. Although you have lots of energy, you're also acutely aware of your own limitations. The more you talk, the more everyone can see the weak spots in your grand plan. Save the speech for another day; big promises only land you into trouble now. Get busy while you have the momentum; lead by example and others will follow."
aries,2014-06-01,"You often prefer to charge ahead without exhibiting any signs of caution, but today you need to stop, listen and think about your actions. Don't be so quick to defend yourself or your plans. Instead, reconsider what you are doing now with an objective eye. If it's not working, make the necessary changes before moving on. This isn't about past failure; it's about getting it right in the present moment."
taurus,2014-06-01,"You might be questioning the value of your work today along with your contribution to your family or community. This self-reflection could be part of a healthy reevaluation process, but be careful not to judge yourself with impossibly high standards. Make positive changes at work that increase your efficiency over the next few weeks, but don't promise more than you can deliver. Minor adjustments today bring major improvements down the road."
gemini,2014-06-01,"Everything seems to be going your way today, but you can still give the wrong answer or misinterpret what you hear if you jump to erroneous conclusions. Although it's nearly a week until your key planet Mercury turns retrograde, he's already slowing down, confounding you with his mischievous antics. You could spend the day being frustrated at life's little ironies or laughing with the universe. The attitude you choose makes all the difference in the world."
cancer,2014-06-01,"A wealth of profound symbolic material is bubbling up from your subconscious today, yet you may not be so quick to tell anyone about it. Although you tend to keep your feelings to yourself even more now that the Moon is visiting your sign, you have much to gain by sharing your inner world. In fact, expressing your vulnerability may be the best way to grow closer to someone you trust. Believe it or not, it's okay to let others nurture your dreams for a change."
leo,2014-06-01,"Your ideas appear to have a life of their own and may even stumble over each other as they fight to be heard and appreciated. Your associates and friends expect a lot from you, but you don't have to try so hard to impress them. Set your priorities, slow your pace and start at the top of your list. You are a force to be reckoned with when your goal is within sight. There's no stopping you now once you have a practical plan in place."
virgo,2014-06-01,"It may be time to share an unsolvable problem you have been keeping to yourself. Running through the same analytical line of thinking on your own one more time won't necessarily bring you to a different conclusion. However, a close friend or associate might offer a new perspective that unlocks a viable solution. Carefully articulating your concerns starts the process, but make sure you listen closely to the feedback you receive to glean the most wisdom out of the conversation."
libra,2014-06-01,"Retreating into your safety zone is an intelligent strategy today if you are feeling emotionally vulnerable. But remember, encountering an obstacle doesn't mean that you have failed on any level. To the contrary, you're receiving a notice from the cosmos that you just reached beyond your normal grasp. Instead of running scared, consider what you can learn from the experience. Keep your wits about you and your sense of optimism close at hand as you begin to revise your plans for the weeks ahead."
scorpio,2014-06-01,"You're certain that knowledge is power, yet there may be more to this belief than is obvious at first glance. Unfortunately, you can't always persuade others to follow your dreams by simply giving them a map and minimum instructions. But mind games and power struggles won't help your cause, either. Instead, continue with your process of spiritual growth and let everyone else do the same. Self-exploration enables you to forge new ways of working with your allies to accomplish your goals."
sagittarius,2014-06-01,"Although others might believe that the gift of gab comes naturally to you, you may have a challenging time expressing what you mean now. Nevertheless, people aren't too surprised if you say something upsetting or controversial, for they expect you to speak your mind freely. You can be honest without offending anyone if you just think about your words before opening your mouth. However, if you don't stop to consider the impact of your message, you will soon be dealing with unintended consequences of premature communication."
capricorn,2014-06-01,Relationship dynamics may be confusing today and it's unclear what your best strategy should be to regain clarity. Perhaps you recently went overboard and said more than was necessary. You might have to pull back a bit now to reestablish a more sustainable balance of energy. Just don't retreat so far that you cut yourself off from your network of emotional support. The good news is you don't have to walk this path alone.
aquarius,2014-06-01,"You are easily irritated today by someone who has a perspective that's dramatically different from yours. You might try to avoid a confrontation, but end up getting into a disagreement anyway. Instead of waiting until you've been pushed into a corner, act preemptively by stating your position as succinctly as possible. The best way to handle a difficult interaction is to shift your attitude from having to win an argument to simply understanding the other point of view. Establishing common ground is the first step to a happy compromise."
pisces,2014-06-01,"The data stream that has been fueling your feelings tapers off now, leaving you uncertain about what to do next. Theoretically, you should be comfortable with the slower and more methodical flow of emotions; but instead you might feel dazed or confused by the sudden change in the relationship landscape. Sort out the new dynamics gradually. You have more time than you realize as long as you keep your heart open throughout the process."
aries,2014-06-02,"It's a breeze for you to accomplish a lot today now that the playful Leo Moon harmonizes with energetic Mars. You may be tempted to set aside your obligations to pursue pleasure, but it's probably not a good idea to trade your promises for immediate gratification. Don't try to shift the blame for your current dilemma onto anyone else. Just consider the consequences and do what makes the most sense in the long run. Find a creative way to have your cake and eat it too."
taurus,2014-06-02,"Although you can't completely avoid the weight of responsibility today, you are likely to be more concerned with expressing your feelings than doing your job. Your romantic heart is in direct conflict with your practical head, distracting you from finishing your chores. Even if you are motivated to push further ahead, you don't have to do anything drastic now. Allow the emotional tension to reach its crescendo and then subside before you swing into action."
gemini,2014-06-02,"Your coworkers or friends may keep you quite busy today, and that's just how you like it. You are at the top of your game, showing off your charm and wit as you fly from one activity to another. But strong desires are brewing just out of sight, so don't bother wasting your resources on trivial matters. Save some energy in reserve for when you will need it over the next few days. Setting a sustainable pace now improves your chances for success down the road."
cancer,2014-06-02,"You could be so sympathetic to people's emotions that sometimes it's tough to know how to respond. However, today you're more likely to immediately react to a difficult situation at work than to take a wait-and-see approach. Don't overcompensate with wildly impulsive behavior just to prove your point. Too much confidence leads to recklessness, which might create new problems faster than you can solve the old ones. Taking the time to listen to what others want enables you to discover a more lasting resolution."
leo,2014-06-02,"You appear to be an open book to everyone around you while the demonstrative Leo Moon lights up your 1st House of Personality. Although some of your peers may not recognize it, you're in touch with profound emotions that are still working their way to the surface. Your thoughts carry even more weight now because they haven't been expressed. Once you share what's on your mind, the tension should dissipate quickly. But there's no need to shock anyone with your colorful disclosure. Consider your audience before you proceed."
virgo,2014-06-02,"You don't want everyone to know your likes and dislikes, prompting you to keep your preferences quiet today. You can easily rationalize hiding your desires by attributing it to your unwillingness to hurt anyone's feelings. However, your predicament won't be fixed by simply withdrawing. Remaining silent about your wishes contributes to the problem and not the solution. Talk about your emotions with enough sensitivity that you don't push others away. No one can fulfill your needs if you don't take a chance and tell them what you want."
libra,2014-06-02,"You enjoy expressing your affection for your friends and colleagues, but you prefer doing so in an emotionally detached manner. However, staying cool becomes almost impossible once you start revealing your desires because others are likely to be more responsive than you anticipated. You might need to confront your own ambiguity today, especially if someone reacts with great intensity. Although you may be resistant to being vulnerable at first, you should feel better once everything is out on the table. Take a risk and open your heart."
scorpio,2014-06-02,"You could surprise yourself today with the speed and intensity of your reaction to an event that is outside of your control. Although you may say that you want to go with the flow, you still have a hard time being flexible now with the Moon's presence in fixed Leo. Luckily, most things should turn out okay if you are willing to step into unknown territory and courageously face the current issues. Remaining open to altering your plans offers you a lot more room for growth."
sagittarius,2014-06-02,"You may feel overjoyed if someone with lots of big ideas breezes into your world and blows your mind with an unexpected opportunity. However, you might also secretly wish you could escape the noise, but you likely won't get very far. No matter where you go now, ungrounded philosophical conversations seem to follow you around. Thankfully, you can learn something very valuable from these animated discussions. Even if you are overwhelmed with too many details today, new information continues to widen your horizons in a way that you truly enjoy."
capricorn,2014-06-02,"Nothing seems simple today. Although you plan on sticking to your agenda, you don't necessarily feel like following all the meanderings of a complex conversation. Uncharacteristically, you might prefer to jump around from one topic to another or slip off into your own daydreams where no one can find you. Don't judge yourself too harshly if you can't live up to the expectation of others. The tables are turned and this time you may be the one who's seeking the fun and resisting the work."
aquarius,2014-06-02,"Although you appear to be flexible today, it's more likely that your mind is made up and additional facts won't be a catalyst for change. Unfortunately, your rigidity can get you into serious trouble now. There's nothing to be gained by letting suppressed fears govern your behavior. Disclosing your current apprehension with a close friend or partner is the smartest way to dissipate the negative energy before it creates real problems. Shining the light of your awareness into the shadows of your subconscious is the first step on your journey of self-discovery."
pisces,2014-06-02,"You want to impress everyone with your exemplary work ethic today, but it may be a real struggle to walk your talk. Unfortunately, your immediate needs are in direct conflict with your distant goals, making it tough to know what to do next. Quiet your mind and listen to your own intuition instead of seeking answers from external sources. Ultimately, being true to yourself says more about your character than anything else."
aries,2014-06-03,You might believe you have all the ingredients necessary to whip up the perfect plan for a pet project today. You feel confident because your vision is clear and you know how to reach your destination. But your positive attitude may be covering up a sneaking suspicion that you're missing an important piece of the puzzle. Too much rigidity makes it impossible to create the future you want. Entertaining unknown scenarios now could change everything.
taurus,2014-06-03,"You can get bent out of shape today if you believe your extra effort isn't making things happen faster. You may even wonder why you're working so hard when no one else seems to care as much as you. Even if you're frustrated by the snail's pace at which everything appears to be moving, don't let your annoyance trigger an emotional meltdown. Take a deep breath and cultivate your patience. It's easier to settle into the current flow when you're not in such a rush."
gemini,2014-06-03,"Everything appears copacetic as your day begins to unfold according to your plans. However, something might distract you before you find your rhythm, making it nearly impossible to maintain steady progress now. Nevertheless, it's still a good idea to keep non-essential thoughts to yourself. Letting your fantasies run wild without sharing them can be quite amusing, but talking about them could land you in big trouble. Staying in touch with your own feelings may be all that's needed to balance the energy now."
cancer,2014-06-03,"It's a breeze to finish your work today if you already addressed the issues raised by last week's distractions, rather than just temporarily diverting them. But if similar topics resurface now, focus on constructive resolution and stick to the process until you know that the energy has played out. Retreating prematurely will just create more problems down the road. Hang in there; your persistence will win out in the end."
leo,2014-06-03,You may grow more theatrical in your personal expression now that the evocative Moon is ambling through your proud sign. You might even become so enchanted by your own intensity that you momentarily forget that you are just one of the players in a complex set of circumstances. Step out of the spotlight and ask questions about what you can do to broaden your overall perspective. Widening your scope of vision helps the energy flow more smoothly for everyone involved.
virgo,2014-06-03,"Handling your responsibilities quickly leads you in the right direction now. Obviously, you want to meet your obligations efficiently, but may be uncertain about the best approach. Remember, your emotional well-being is directly connected to your productivity today. Plan your day strategically and don't be afraid to make use of the people and resources that are at your disposal. Keeping an open line of communication is your secret weapon for success."
libra,2014-06-03,"You want to show your friends how much they mean to you now, but nearly everything you do feels contrived and somehow misses the mark. Falling short of your own expectations might lead you to try even harder. Forget about impressing others in your personal life today. Instead, just concentrate on doing your job to the best of your abilities. An unexpected reward may come your way as long as you get your work finished on time."
scorpio,2014-06-03,"Shifting gears and planning your next career move now may not be as easy as you wish. Fortunately, you feel strong enough to manage the pressures of change without letting anyone know that you are struggling with the transition. Nevertheless, revealing your vulnerability and admitting that you can't do everything by yourself can actually create opportunities for positive growth. Expressing your feelings sets the stage for others to offer you the heartwarming support you need."
sagittarius,2014-06-03,"You're dreaming of distant horizons now that the Moon is visiting your 9th House of Faraway Places. However, reaching your destination may require more than simply heading off in the right direction. Luckily, with a little extra effort today you can organize your life so it resonates with your long-term goals. Think small at first and tend the seeds of your ideas until they grow into a strategic action plan that guides you into the future."
capricorn,2014-06-03,"A relationship with a powerful person may have more impact on your future than you want to admit. However, this is not the best day to ignore a problem, for it won't just go away on its own now. Push your buried anger out into the open so it can't fester any longer in the dark. After the air is clear of judgment, everyone is likely to feel more optimistic about the future and willing to invest in your success."
aquarius,2014-06-03,"You seem to know what someone wants before anyone else does today, but you still might not be in the mood to drop everything and lose yourself in service. The Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions reflects your heightened sensitivity to the feelings of those around you. But don't be too self-critical if you just want to escape into your own world for a while. After all, replenishing your emotional vitality enables you to be more supportive of others."
pisces,2014-06-03,"You may be disheartened if you realize that you can't satisfy your craving for adventure now. The extroverted Leo Moon is occupying your 6th House of Habits, encouraging you to take a chance and break out of an old routine. However, something tells you that it's not quite time yet to step out of your comfort zone. Fortunately, you will be better prepared to make your move later on if you stop and focus on every little detail that confronts you today."
aries,2014-06-04,It really doesn't matter if you are eager to take a risk and make something outrageous happen; you won't likely get your crazy plans too far off the ground today. Unfulfilled promises weigh heavy on your mind until you handle your current obligations. But don't let frustration get the upper hand because having an emotional meltdown now won't improve the quality of your life or endear you to anyone else. Overcome your impatience and wait for a better moment to start something new.
taurus,2014-06-04,"Although you believe you can work within the current limitations being placed on you, you can't help but fantasize about your favorite escape anyhow. Of course you realize that rebellious behavior wont necessarily bring the results you want, but you're not sure you have enough control to keep things stable today. Nevertheless, even if blasting your way out of a rut sounds like a good idea, common sense should win out for now."
gemini,2014-06-04,"You have personal matters that demand your attention today, even if you're also pulled toward more public obligations. You might think that your job will offer you some respite from your domestic responsibilities, but you won't be able to avoid your family duties for too long. Just don't try to outsmart anyone by pretending to do your work when you're not. Be honest about your situation while handling your responsibilities the best you can. Put your integrity into action and the rest will fall into place."
cancer,2014-06-04,"You might become annoyed if someone at work pushes you too hard today. People may have inflated expectations, yet you know that there's only so much that one person can do in one day. Unfortunately, trouble arises if you don't establish clear limits. There's no need to complain about anything beyond your control because that only makes the situation worse. It's more constructive in the long run to let others know exactly what you can and cannot do. Setting healthy boundaries earns you respect and admiration from your peers, even if they resist at first."
leo,2014-06-04,"An unexpected out-of-pocket expense is more difficult to absorb if your current financial situation is unstable. But it doesn't make sense to get discouraged now, even if you don't see how you're going to balance your incoming funds with your outgoing cash. Although a longer-term solution may take conscious effort, the immediate problem is temporary and should ease with just a little effort on your part. Consider this a gentle reminder to save for a rainy day."
virgo,2014-06-04,"You may feel as if you're being bounced around emotionally today while the changeable Moon moves through your sign. You want nothing more than to focus on what is most useful; however, your day won't likely unfold according to your plans. Instead, you might have to revise your agenda several times to accommodate the shifting tides, which are apparently beyond your control. Letting go of your earlier expectations enables you to transform a challenging day into one that's filled with pleasant surprises."
libra,2014-06-04,"Your associates might not realize that you're having a tough time today because you're adept at hiding your concerns. Ironically, your doubts could be greatly eased by the simple act of sharing them with someone you respect. However, your fear of being criticized could be your biggest obstacle to letting your guard down. But remaining silent and engaging in endless analysis won't lead to a logical resolution. Although you may surprise others with your radical perspective, initiating an honest dialogue establishes a new level of trust."
scorpio,2014-06-04,"There are so many things happening in your life all at once now that you may not have time to create a sensible game plan. Figuring the details out on the fly might get you through the day unless someone questions your integrity, prompting you to defend your intentions. However, open conflict isn't a constructive course of action today so change your tactics and be less impulsive in your approach. Focusing on your goals and ignoring your detractors enables you to circumvent an unnecessary argument. Channel your passion into your work."
sagittarius,2014-06-04,"Although you're still interested in setting your work aside in favor of another enjoyable diversion, taking the time to play is harder to justify today. Your professional responsibilities may be so demanding now that you just can't get away with your planned escape. You might feel frustrated, but don't worry; the pressure won't last. Hunker down and do what's expected of you so you can feel free enough to relax later on. There's no shame in taking pride in a job well done."
capricorn,2014-06-04,"Your ambitious behavior might not pay off right away, but that shouldn't stop you from being extra conscientious about achieving your goals. It's not that people won't appreciate your contribution; it's just that they are so busy today that they may not stop to acknowledge your work. Don't waste your time worrying about being noticed. Your singular focus and unwavering patience earn you recognition in the long run."
aquarius,2014-06-04,"Financial institutions, speculative investments or working partnerships can create extra stress today and there might not be an obvious way around it. However, don't put off any business that needs to be handled right away. Procrastination is not your friend. Money management may not be a lot of fun, but taking care of complicated fiscal affairs now increases your sense of security and helps you feel more at ease."
pisces,2014-06-04,"You may run into trouble with someone who is critical of your decisions. Admittedly, you would be a lot more willing to acknowledge another person's authority if he or she actually deserves your respect. But it's challenging to acquiesce to anyone who assumes power without actually earning it. Don't be afraid to stand up for your convictions today. You will only have to face similar issues again if you back down now for the sake of convenience. Speak from your heart and hope for the best."
aries,2014-06-05,"Your fellow workers may be very critical of your actions today while the Moon visits your 6th House of Details. However, you aren't in the mood to change your behavior just to placate anyone else. Perhaps you're being judged unfairly, but it's still wise to consider how to address everyone's concerns before you just shut them out. This could be a significant opportunity to contribute more to the group process rather than complaining about others who don't appreciate what you do. Being a team player now is your key to success."
taurus,2014-06-05,"Although your thinking might be a bit scattered now, it's helpful that your friends who normally tempt you to leave your responsibilities are too busy to bother you. Ironically, you could actually finish your work because you are not as likely to be distracted by others today. But don't get lazy even if you are ahead of schedule. You can accomplish more than you expect if you simply keep moving at a steady pace."
gemini,2014-06-05,"A stroll down Memory Lane allows you to remember childhood events now with more clarity than usual, turning fantasies into a pleasant distraction from your regular routine. However, your little excursion into your personal history may reawaken complex emotions from the past. Analyze your feelings so you know which ones are significant enough to motivate action in the present moment. This cathartic process takes practice, but, fortunately, you can learn to keep up external appearances while you also attend to your journey within."
cancer,2014-06-05,"You may be extremely productive today if your new ideas reinforce your professional goals. The rational Virgo Moon's presence in your 3rd House of Communication empowers you to think your way through the noise of the day, elevating your confidence and signaling that you are on the right track. Thankfully, there isn't any hurry now, so step back and give your current plan plenty of time to solidify. Fine-tuning your strategy makes the difference between failure and success."
leo,2014-06-05,"Taking inventory of your recent accomplishments inspires you to raise your work to the next level without too much effort. Stabilizing your financial and social networks enables you to cultivate a higher degree of creativity now. Remember, you don't have to expend more energy to achieve success; gain efficiency and consistency by following a strategic plan. Work smarter, not harder."
virgo,2014-06-05,"On one hand, you almost always aspire toward quality in your work and in your relationships. Fortunately, sound data enables you to think clearly and make wise choices. On the other hand, the reflective Moon's visit to your sign emphasizes your subjective feelings, which can have you reconsidering a recent decision. Taking the time to listen to both your head and your heart leads to the best of both worlds."
libra,2014-06-05,"You still have another day to finish up old business before the Moon returns to your sign and initiates a brand new cycle. However, just meeting your obligations in a timely manner leaves you feeling unfulfilled. Walk on the wild side and be willing to sacrifice a little efficiency today for the possibility of pleasure. Don't rush into something new; instead, pay homage to your key planet Venus by incorporating elements of grace and beauty in all that you do now."
scorpio,2014-06-05,"You must find a harmonious balance between your perfect vision of the future and your current reality. The Moon is traveling through your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes, drawing your attention to all the potential magic of the day. But you mustn't lose sight of your position and what you have on your plate right now. Thankfully, you will know that you're on the correct path when you can hold your dreams in awareness even when you are awake."
sagittarius,2014-06-05,"Grand ideas and extravagant plans come naturally to you, but today's detail-oriented Virgo Moon in your 10th House of Career requires you to narrow your focus. However, no one can force you to change your habits; your motivation must come from within. Rather than gazing at every distant horizon, concentrate on the work directly in front of you. You might be surprised by how much joy a sense of accomplishment can bring."
capricorn,2014-06-05,"Everyone is seeking your advice today because it seems that you are an expert at planning events, managing projects or simply determining the best way to get a job done. Your mind is like a sharp knife, cutting through the myriad of details and enabling you to make crucial decisions about what is important and what is not. But it isn't healthy to become overly detached from your feelings. Add a bit of compassion to your process now, for it can make the difference between just going through the motions and stunning others with your sincerity."
aquarius,2014-06-05,"You might grow uncomfortable today if anyone brings up a touchy emotional issue that you cannot easily ignore. Ironically, your current attempts to sidestep a difficult discussion may actually take more out of you than just breathing deeply and jumping in. Even if you're overwhelmed by the complexity of emotions, listen to what others say and then speak from your heart. Luckily, you can emerge from this conflict with a renewed appreciation for life and a stronger connection with someone you love."
pisces,2014-06-05,"Unfortunately, your friends and partners may be less inclined to support your dreams and fantasies now, which can be more than a little disheartening for you. The Moon's activation of your 7th House of Partnerships shifts the focus away from you and puts it on those with whom you work and play. But don't blame others for your current feelings; instead, take some time and gently nurture those parts of yourself that remain unappreciated. Ultimately, you don't need outside approval to let your light shine."
aries,2014-06-06,"A sluggish feeling in the morning may create more delays on a project. You might be unmotivated if everything doesn't go your way now, but a minor setback can actually be a test to determine if you're ready to move on. Overcome your present discouragement by visualizing your ideal future. Fortunately, with a positive attitude you're able to gain momentum throughout the day. Don't quit too soon; instead, work extra hard to actualize your dreams."
taurus,2014-06-06,"Today could be quite gratifying as long as you set realistic expectations. You might need to scale back your plans if you reach too far, especially if it feels as if time is running out. Luckily, there may not be any significant surprises, allowing you to simply follow your agenda without any distractions. You know exactly what it takes to be successful, so get started before you waste any more time. Your singular focus and unwavering determination are key to your success now."
gemini,2014-06-06,"You think it's a smart tactic to withhold your true intentions today because you're worried that people won't support you if they know what you're really doing. However, there aren't many valid reasons to keep a secret now because everything finds its way out into the open anyhow. Asking for help improves your chances of reaching your goals in a timely manner. Giving others the benefit of the doubt motivates them to step up to the plate on your behalf."
cancer,2014-06-06,"Although you won't likely receive exactly what you want now, your ultimate fate is still in your hands. What happens next will be determined by your response to your disappointment. Complaining isn't useful; it only moves you further away from satisfaction. However, accepting each current moment without judging anyone can free you to make a significant breakthrough today. Don't get stuck in a previous failure; instead, embrace the future with a healthy dose of optimism."
leo,2014-06-06,"You might actually believe that you let someone down today, but you're probably judging yourself without having all the facts. Imagine what you can do in the present moment instead of worrying about what you should have done already. It's time to set your old dreams aside and create meaningful new ones that are built on a solid foundation, rather than on shifting sands. Others will admire your courage if you do the right thing and follow your heart."
virgo,2014-06-06,"It's often easier to be open and honest when there's something to criticize, rather than when everything is flowing along smoothly. However, your goals become more obtainable if you shift your attention from everyone else's behavior to your own. Get down to business and tackle your chores one at a time. Removing the barriers to your own success requires your full concentration; actions speak louder than words."
libra,2014-06-06,"It's admirable when you commit to live out your dreams in the real world, but you need to work harder than you imagined in order to make much progress. Even if pleasure seems elusive today, you can still recognize the gigantic difference that your attitude makes as you process your annoyance. What happens next is up to you; the power of positive thinking inspires you to manifest your visions. After all, you're the master of your own destiny."
scorpio,2014-06-06,"You pride yourself in taking a realistic approach to domestic issues now, making it nearly impossible for anyone to convince you to change your opinion. Although you're not likely to shift your thinking today, you're able to tell the difference between what you currently have and what you would want in an ideal world. Balancing reality and fantasy in your own unique way inspires you to make the best of both worlds."
sagittarius,2014-06-06,"You want to jump off the emotional roller-coaster today, but ending your ride prematurely isn't the best idea. It may take a few more weeks to achieve your current goals so hold on through all the ups and downs to earn the success you seek. But if you grow weary of all the excitement, just remind yourself that it's only a temporary distraction. Your perseverance goes a long way toward helping you reach your destination."
capricorn,2014-06-06,"Although you rarely have a problem with exercising self-discipline, a little tough love is exactly what you need now. However, the criticism softens into support once you demonstrate your willingness to work diligently to make your dreams come true. Nevertheless, stern Saturn ignores anything less than a total commitment, so establish your priorities and dedicate yourself fully to manifesting your highest potential."
aquarius,2014-06-06,"It might feel as if you're running out of time but this sense of urgency is just a symptom of the looming Mercury retrograde. If you haven't delivered on a promise, someone may appear to make an emotional retreat today. However, it's not too late to turn the tables in your favor. Instead of finding fault with others now, take responsibility for your role in the situation. Working to rebuild trust is wiser than continuing to test the limits of a relationship. Don't underestimate the positive impact a simple apology can make. As Yoda states, ""Do. Or do not. There is no try."""
pisces,2014-06-06,"Your illusions are bumping up against reality and you don't know what to think now that you can see the truth. You're no longer blindly optimistic, but it would be a mistake if you were to become cynical in the process. Ultimately, a middle-of-the-road approach is best when managing the logistics of your life. Cultivate a positive attitude without getting lost in worries about the future. Taking one methodical step at a time is the fastest way to realize your dreams."
aries,2014-06-07,"There's no need to be in a hurry today, trying to quickly mend everyone's feelings at home or on the job. Instead of believing you must fix everything that's broken, just listen to what others say without taking direct action yet. Even if you want to jump right in, let the energy settle down until you can see which way the prevailing winds are blowing. You can play the role of the proverbial superhero once you have a better sense of the emotional environment."
taurus,2014-06-07,"Although people seem to be pulling at you from different directions, making your life rather hectic, there really isn't much you can do to change your schedule today. Unfortunately, your social calendar may get even noisier over the days ahead, challenging you to meet your professional obligations. Instead of attempting to get all your work done right away, pace yourself so you can sustain your energy through this busy phase. Focus on long-term goals rather than short-term solutions for the best results."
gemini,2014-06-07,"You may be required to deal with important money matters over the weeks ahead, and the sooner you roll up your sleeves and start, the better the results. It's likely that you have already been thinking about your financial security, yet may have put off doing anything tangible about it. Don't let the day slip away without giving at least some attention to taking care of personal business. Today's decisive actions set the tone for the weeks ahead."
cancer,2014-06-07,"Your emotions seem more powerful today, making it challenging to face an important issue that is looming on your horizon. Although you have an opportunity to make something big happen now, you may still choose to remain silent. Don't waste time criticizing yourself for what you should have done or could have said. Accept that your disclosure will happen at the perfect moment. Trust in the wisdom of cosmic timing and your own intuition."
leo,2014-06-07,"You're less likely to be found in the spotlight today, especially since you could be searching for ways to remain out of sight. Your need for some downtime is currently more important for your soul than anything else now. Make use of Mercury's backtracking in your 12th House of Invisibility and schedule a short personal retreat as soon as possible. Temporarily withdrawing from the hustle and bustle might be all it takes to recharge your batteries."
virgo,2014-06-07,"A long-lost acquaintance may resurface in the days ahead, since Mercury turns retrograde in your 11th House of Social Networking. You could receive intriguing invitations for parties, yet you don't want to deal with the anxiety that might accompany these kinds of gatherings. Instead of turning into a total recluse, get out and socialize with your friends. Honoring your relationships within your community ultimately leads to good feelings all the way around."
libra,2014-06-07,"You have a ton of patience now in dealing with complex situations at work, allowing you to get involved without necessarily having to be in charge. It's relatively easy to delegate responsibilities because you understand the true nature of cooperation. Unfortunately, a taste of success is so exhilarating that you may be tempted to assume more authority. Be careful; being in control can give you a false sense of security. It takes a village to create lasting change."
scorpio,2014-06-07,"It feels as if you are luxuriously relaxing in a warm bath, but in truth you're actually being soothed by your own reassuring thoughts. You have a great capacity to create your reality now by simply focusing on the future and placing it in your mind's eye. However, don't expect anything to happen overnight; it could take several weeks to see real progress on matters of importance. Your unwavering faith is your ticket to positive transformation."
sagittarius,2014-06-07,"Normally, you prefer to dance around a tricky interaction or an unpleasant feeling with a laugh, but today you're ready to sink into the twilight zone of your passions. Mischievous Mercury is pulling you into unfamiliar waters as it turns retrograde in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. However, the messenger planet is in emotionally protective Cancer, encouraging you to explore your own subconscious world without talking about it every step of the way. You cannot rush this journey; the timing will unfold according to a plan greater than yours."
capricorn,2014-06-07,"Someone might try to upset your equilibrium today by provoking a strong emotional response that distracts you from being logical. The problem is that you rely on your common sense to navigate you through even the stickiest of relationship dilemmas and you become insecure when it disappears for a while. Don't bother trying to rationalize what's in your heart now; words only get in the way. If you come from a place of love, then clarity will arrive in the nick of time."
aquarius,2014-06-07,"Your recent attempt to shake up the regularity in your daily routine may not have worked out as expected. Now that Mercury is retrograding in your 6th House of Habits, you can revisit this goal of  behavior modification with greater success. Just remember that putting your new plans into action could take longer than you wish. Practice makes perfect; progress will likely jump forward by leaps and bounds after Mercury turns direct on July 1."
pisces,2014-06-07,"You are on a creative roll, but others may not see the results of your work for several weeks. Don't worry if your material isn't acknowledged yet; your talent will be appreciated when the time is right. For now, simply enjoy the vibrant action in the hidden realms of your fantasies without letting logistics get in your way. Focus on the dreams you want to manifest, for reality grows where your attention flows."
aries,2014-06-08,"You may choose to follow your heart today, even if you don't know where you will end up. You might be slightly uncomfortable with the idea of relinquishing some of your freedom, yet this seems to be a small price to pay for establishing a powerful connection with a special person. Remember that narrowing your options to gain something in return can actually be very satisfying in the long run."
taurus,2014-06-08,"Emotional fulfillment isn't only about feeling connected with someone you love; it's also about aligning yourself with a higher purpose today. Luckily, it's easy to find satisfaction now that your head and your heart are in tune with each other. You intuitively know what to do to attract wealth and to express love, so don't let self-doubt limit your options when the planets are working in your favor. Dream big and be ready to grab the brass ring when you get the chance."
gemini,2014-06-08,"Slowing down enough to sink into your emotions is challenging today, especially if you're afraid of what you might discover. But once you let the distractions fade away, you could be pulled into the dark recesses of your imagination. Unfortunately, a clever turn of phrase isn't sufficient to bring you back into the light. However, with the right amount of patience and persistence, your negativity can dissipate and you could return with treasures from your journey within."
cancer,2014-06-08,"You're willing to handle the intensity of someone else's fears today because you have recently wrestled with your own inner demons and won. It's not that you think you have all the answers; it's just that you're capable of witnessing this process for others without feeling threatened or afraid. Nevertheless, don't underestimate the commitment that is required; this is intense emotional work and your compassionate support will be greatly appreciated."
leo,2014-06-08,"Your persistent search for the truth may uncover important realizations that change your day for the better. But it's not easy to find an uplifting story in the midst of heavy energy today. You're sorting out your emotions now and could learn an important lesson along the way. You haven't chosen an easy journey, but exploring beneath the surface alters your perspective and gives you a brand new lease on life. Thankfully, your courageous heart knows no bounds."
virgo,2014-06-08,"Your emotions are your power source now, enabling you to take a minor setback in stride. If you have done your homework, you can fully concentrate your efforts on whatever issues arise. Luckily, this isn't about slipping into denial; in fact, it's your critical thinking that enables you to see through the camouflage and effectively cut to the chase. A positive attitude and a practical approach empower you to overcome even the stickiest dilemma."
libra,2014-06-08,"You are pulled into a complex emotional drama today that raises an old familiar issue. Thankfully, there are no threats buried in the present circumstances, yet they still remind you of a previous power struggle when you weren't in control of your feelings. Don't look back too long or your fears can prompt you to limit your current options. Instead, consider the myriad of possibilities; nearly anything you put your mind to now has the potential of becoming real."
scorpio,2014-06-08,"Your power comes from your wizardly ability to undergo a surprising metamorphosis without missing a step today. You are the legendary phoenix that arises from the ashes as Pluto harmonizes with magnetic Venus. Others might be afraid of such dynamic change, but you instinctively know that it's futile to resist these evolutionary waves. Being flexible enough to go with the cosmic flow now is a sign of strength, not weakness."
sagittarius,2014-06-08,"Although you might disagree about the truth of a story, it's pointless today to do battle over a simple difference of opinion. However, carefully explaining your beliefs enables you to separate them from the hard facts. Making this important distinction lessens your chance of getting into an unnecessary argument with someone over a topic where there can never be a clear winner. Taking the high road for the sake of harmony casts you in an admirable light."
capricorn,2014-06-08,"You won't likely be coerced into giving up your authority today, yet you could perform a bit of gentle persuasion yourself. You might use sheer stubbornness as a last-minute strategy now, but it's only because you believe you could lose too much if you take drastic action. Trying to defend your power is a waste of time; go out and express your creativity to mix up the energy, instead. Others may appreciate you making the first move but you have the most to gain from taking a chance."
aquarius,2014-06-08,"Anything you decide to keep to yourself now carries even more weight than what you choose to reveal. However, you don't have a permission slip to tell everything to everybody; there are many things better left unsaid. Just think through your motives for sharing and then select the best time to talk today. Your current communication can improve relationship dynamics if your intentions are clear. Knowing your audience is just as important as knowing what to say."
pisces,2014-06-08,"Your acute perceptions and rational perspective trigger a critical decision about your feelings today. But ironically, it might seem as if you're temporarily lost, wandering in the desert in search of an oasis. Even if you exhibit strength of conviction in your current choices, your lack of commitment could still be problematic now. A resolution made with your head is not as long-lasting as one made with your heart."
aries,2014-06-09,"Life becomes a bit more complex today because you cannot avoid your emotions with simple distractions. Your feelings are more persistent now, gnawing at your awareness until you stop and consider the issues that they raise. Although you might grow irritated because you prefer to be independent from your attachments, sinking into your current experience teaches you more than running off in search of the next great thing."
taurus,2014-06-09,"Relationships are in the spotlight as the mysterious Scorpio Moon haunts your 7th House of Others today. However, simplicity and security are still important with romantic Venus traveling through your practical sign. Nevertheless, you may be dissatisfied with what you have unless it touches you on a spiritual level. Although your attraction to physical pleasure is strong, don't underestimate your current desire for meaning. However, your search won't lead you anywhere significant unless you embark on your journey with an open heart."
gemini,2014-06-09,"You might enjoy making plans to escape today, but that doesn't mean you will actually go anywhere. It's just that dynamics at work have grown more complicated and there doesn't seem to be an easy way through the maze. The real world can require your physical presence, but not your full attention. Turning up the volume on your fantasies now allows you to explore other dimensions without even telling anyone that you have temporarily checked out. Luckily, your secret weapon is your natural ability to be in two places at once."
cancer,2014-06-09,"You're at your best when you are in touch with your emotions, even if something doesn't feel quite right today. You prefer to be aware of all the subtle intricacies of interpersonal dynamics. But being more sensitive now doesn't mean that you are willing to expose your vulnerability. Don't let anyone coerce you into revealing your secrets before you are ready. Trust your intuition; wait until you feel safe enough to share your heart."
leo,2014-06-09,"You could find yourself stuck in a social situation that you helped to create, but you probably didn't mean for it to last this long. Your feelings may be at odds with your outer world now and it doesn't seem as if circumstances will change anytime soon. Others might even pressure you to lighten up and enjoy yourself today, but you continue to resist their well-meaning intentions. Fortunately, your ability to imagine new possibilities is strong. What happens in the future often begins as a dream."
virgo,2014-06-09,"You are uncertain about how far to take a conversation today. Even if you're motivated to go deep, you don't want things at work to become too intense. Unfortunately, a simple interaction could morph into something more complicated, distracting you from your goals. Be as specific as possible when expressing what you need because a fuzzy message can lead to misinterpretation. Setting boundaries might be awkward now, but it will be better for everyone if you do. After all, others count on you to keep it real."
libra,2014-06-09,"Your emotional needs seem to be in direct conflict with your logical thoughts now, yet your feelings are too convincing to simply ignore. Nevertheless, you might not want to tell anyone your dreams because you're unsure of what you would do if your wishes were granted. It may be easier to live under the illusion that satisfaction is unattainable than to actually face the realization that it's within reach. Don't allow your self-doubt to get in the way of your happiness; success remains elusive until you believe in yourself."
scorpio,2014-06-09,"You know you can't just share everything you feel today because it's inappropriate to let everyone see through your protective walls. This can be a source of ongoing frustration, for you tend to subscribe to the all-or-nothing school of interactions where anything less than the whole truth is a lie. There's an important lesson hidden within the current dynamics, so try to understand the value of consciously limiting what you reveal in order to increase the impact of what you say."
sagittarius,2014-06-09,"You don't like feeling boxed in by a previous commitment, but you're true to your word and ultimately willing to turn down an invitation today so you can complete your work. Nevertheless, you might be annoyed at someone else's inflexibility that prevents you from being free to pursue your dreams. Don't let your frustration get in the way of your productivity. Honoring your obligations early in the day offers you a better chance to play later on."
capricorn,2014-06-09,"Fun and games may have to wait a few days because coworkers are making significant demands on your time. However, you don't know exactly how to respond since other people aren't communicating in a straightforward manner now. Nothing you say or do seems to encourage them to open up. Just remember that you can go anywhere you want in the privacy of your fantasies, but you must get serious and establish your priorities if you want to make your dreams a reality."
aquarius,2014-06-09,"You might not be able to express yourself as openly as you wish today because of someone who exerts authority over you. Although no one can easily extinguish your creative spirit these days, you're not happy about the restrictions. You don't like feeling caged and your inner wild animal longs for independence that now seems quite elusive. Don't give up; remember, you're the only one in control of your heart. Freedom is a lot closer than you think."
pisces,2014-06-09,"The horizons of your fantasies extend farther today with otherworldly Neptune in the planetary mix. However, you might realize that you're not free to explore as far as you can imagine, especially if other people's feelings are linked to yours in a very real manner. There is a high level of emotional interdependence now, making it wiser to keep some of your dreams private. There may be a better time to share your thoughts in a few days, but practicing patience is your smartest strategy for a while longer."
aries,2014-06-10,"You may be a bit emotionally scrambled today and could have a tricky time sorting out what you actually want. You know what's best for you, but it might not sound as enticing as something else you wish to do now. Be careful making long-term decisions because it's tempting to chase a mirage. Bring your thoughts down to earth sooner than later to minimize the potential of falling short of your dreams. Entertain your fantasies without feeling the urgency to act on any of them just yet."
taurus,2014-06-10,"You're often the practical one that others go to for a reality check. However, you might have a hard time distinguishing between fact and fancy today. Although you could begin your day acutely aware of what's going on, it's all too easy to slip farther away from the truth and back into a familiar land of fantasies. Unfortunately, you can't sustain your dreams unless they are well-grounded; save your leap of faith for another day once your clarity returns."
gemini,2014-06-10,"Although you may wake up feeling lighthearted; this is still one of those days that can drag you through the emotional waters of your murky imagination. However, this dilemma might appear more serious than it actually is because you stand to learn quite a bit about human nature if you are willing to keep an open mind. Being receptive to all the positive potential is wonderful, but acknowledging your practical limitations is the first step to manifesting your dreams."
cancer,2014-06-10,"Expansive ideas lure you into seeing life through a more optimistic lens now. Unfortunately, evading the reality of your responsibilities doesn't actually mean that you can get away with avoiding deadlines for long. Instead of sneaking around the edges today, stop to evaluate where you are and where you are going. It's easier to take the next step once you have your bearings. Just remember, finishing up your chores allows you to explore your options with less baggage."
leo,2014-06-10,"Making choices based on other people's expectations is hard work. Sometimes it's exhausting when everyone looks to you in order to figure it all out. But today you're eager to show your friends that you can be wildly creative, too. Experimenting with something you haven't ever tried before is exhilarating as long as you leave enough time to fulfill the promises that you made earlier. It's up to you to find the right balance between being responsible and having fun."
virgo,2014-06-10,Your friends and acquaintances aren't the best positive influence on your career life now because they may encourage you to expand your horizons and open your heart to deep mystical truths. Their advice would be great on any other day but you have a long list of chores that you must finish today. Don't let anyone pull you off course; just keep returning to the obligations that are right there on your plate until they are gone. Honoring your commitments is currently the real food for your soul.
libra,2014-06-10,"It's easy to imagine better ways to do your job now, but when you try to put one of your brilliant ideas into action, the logistics suddenly run amok. You're motivated to do the right thing, but are also inspired to express your creativity when pursuing your ambitions. Don't be fooled by your own enthusiasm today; take on less and reach your goals rather than inflating your expectations and coming up short later on."
scorpio,2014-06-10,"Your emotions are pulling you in one direction now as your intellect lures you down a completely different path. Unfortunately, your knowledge of which way is smarter isn't enough to make the right decision. You can't just choose one over the other, for there is more going on than meets the eye. Take a more spiritual approach by listening to your heart and saving your rationalizations for another day. Cultivating your creativity inspires you to make the right choice."
sagittarius,2014-06-10,"The good news is that your visions can be profound today, as long as you don't slip and fall into the abyss of the unknown. Expansive Jupiter opens your mind so wide now that you could temporarily lose touch with reality. But you can't just say yes to every invitation; there isn't enough time in the day. Ask your friends and associates for assistance; you'll be surprised at how quickly they unite to support your dreams. Letting others help you narrow your options and define your priorities is your smartest strategy."
capricorn,2014-06-10,"Your professional ambitions drive you to be recognized for what you do. But instead of standing out because of your leadership skills, you might be appreciated today simply for your positive attitude. Although you're not able to take charge in the manner you wish, your outlook on life is still inspirational. Don't let a few difficult moments convince you that your strategy isn't going as expected. Keep up the good work; whatever the process, tangible rewards are just around the next corner."
aquarius,2014-06-10,"Turning your goals into a workable plan can be challenging today. Once you actually start moving toward your current destination, you might misinterpret the signs and believe that you're heading in the wrong direction. You are traveling through some very tricky territory and it's easy to get confused. You're even tempted to react quickly and alter your approach. But it's wiser to hold your present course for a while longer. You may be happily surprised when the fog lifts and you realize you've been on the right track all along."
pisces,2014-06-10,"Although you feel wishy-washy at times, your exciting dreams of travel and adventure are currently not up for negotiation. You're quite certain of your goals today and will confidently share them with anyone who could possibly help your cause. Unfortunately, the more you say now, the less believable your story becomes, so it's a smart idea to save your explanations for another day. Sometimes silence really is golden once you've spoken your truth."
aries,2014-06-11,"Your restlessness could get the best of you as you dream about all the possibilities in your life now and the fiery Sagittarius Moon tempts you to extend your limits even further. You may even believe that the signs are telling you to blast ahead and grab every opportunity, even if you lack the energy to keep up with such a hectic schedule. Be smart and practice saying no or you might spread yourself so thin that you end up having no fun at all."
taurus,2014-06-11,"You may spend a lot of money on something you don't really need, but an impulsive purchase isn't necessarily a smart idea today. If you're afraid you'll lose your chance by letting the opportunity pass, you might act quickly and then later regret your momentary lack of fiscal discipline. However, your sense of urgency is an illusion and can prompt you to overreact. You can avoid buyer's remorse if you simply take extra time to weigh your options prior to opening your wallet."
gemini,2014-06-11,"No matter how enticing a social invitation sounds now, you might need some time to relax away from the noise of the crowd. However, everyone seems to be encouraging you to join in the action. Opportunities abound, but you don't have to live up to anyone's expectations other than your own. Rather than succumbing to peer pressure, listen to your inner voice and do what feels right. Spending time alone is tonic for your soul."
cancer,2014-06-11,"Your ambitious ideas about what you intend to accomplish at work today may not be very realistic. Remember, even your most sensible plans might need to be set aside if you're distracted by something more interesting than your responsibilities. It's not that you're feeling scattered; it's just that the enthusiastic Sagittarius Moon's visit to your 6th House of Employment means that professional boredom could set in. It's okay to explore new avenues of expression as long as you deliver on your promises first. Productivity isn't the only measure of success."
leo,2014-06-11,"You can't wait to socialize with your friends, even if you have plenty of work to do today. It's difficult to get the fun and games out of your mind no matter how intensely you focus on the tasks at hand. Acknowledging that you deserve some downtime is part of your solution now; the other part is cleverly scheduling your day to fit in both work and play. Once you have your reward in mind, you can finish your chores in record time."
virgo,2014-06-11,"You might feel as if you're at odds with yourself today because you can't find the right balance between too little and too much. Thankfully, you are naturally competent in handling a myriad of details. However, your current extravagance tempts you to commit to more than you manage, especially if you consciously skim over a crucial piece of information. Dreaming about every possibility now is healthy as long as you remember that your common sense is still your greatest asset."
libra,2014-06-11,"Your friends may believe that you are a bit imbalanced today, especially if your exuberance pushes you toward big thinking. Although everything may appear better than it actually is now, you could overcompensate by seeing potential problems everywhere you look. Keep in mind that the truth is somewhere in between the extremes and it's smarter to moderate your excitement rather than going overboard in either direction. It's easier to make adjustments along the way than waiting until it's too late."
scorpio,2014-06-11,"You may not be willing to let go of your financial concerns, even if you're more positive now about the future. The upbeat Sagittarius Moon shines her spotlight on your 2nd House of Possessions now and you recognize that your success depends upon consolidating recent gains. However, you could end up jeopardizing your progress if you try to bolt ahead too quickly. Cultivate your enthusiasm, but move forward cautiously until you build momentum that you can sustain for the long haul."
sagittarius,2014-06-11,"Your feelings are key to your happiness today as the evocative Moon returns to your inspirational sign. Unfortunately, you are tempted on occasion to override your emotions if they get in the way of a potentially exciting activity. Nevertheless, you're unable to ignore what your body tells you. Your moods are vital indicators of your overall well-being now, so pay extra careful attention to honoring what your heart needs."
capricorn,2014-06-11,"Oddly enough, you're quite talkative today, even though you might prefer being left to your own devices. You're not eager to engage in small talk now, making it wise to avoid social events and large crowds. Initiating meaningful one-on-one conversations allows you to connect on a deeper level with someone special. Although networking could help you achieve your goals, it's okay to save the superfluous words for another day."
aquarius,2014-06-11,"It's not easy to take your job seriously now, unless it involves interacting with your peers. You're buzzing with optimism as the Moon brightens your 11th House of Friends, firing up your social life. You long to be connected with your tribe, even if it's in a business rather than personal setting. Fortunately, you could receive the support and admiration of your coworkers if you deliver on your promises as expected. Going the extra mile pays demonstrates your willingness to be a team player."
pisces,2014-06-11,"Your inspiring vision of the future captures the imaginations of your colleagues today, leading you to assume a greater amount of authority. You might not want to be the boss, but others realize that you're one of the few people who intuitive know how all the puzzle pieces fit together. Don't turn down a leadership role if you are chosen by your peers. Stand up now and play your part; you can always step back with a sense of accomplishment later on."
aries,2014-06-12,"A concrete plan is not enough to find love and keep it alive. It's no secret that it requires hard work to make a solid relationship endure through the long haul. You may feel more isolated now, prompting you to reach out to someone you trust. Although your current communication may not ignite passion, it is still useful for building a firm foundation for the future. Don't be concerned if immediate satisfaction seems elusive today; there's a larger game playing out. Believe it or not, some things are worth the wait."
taurus,2014-06-12,"You're motivated by financial rewards or anticipating a romantic interlude only to hit the wall before fully engaging your motors. This may feel like a setback, but it doesn't necessarily mean defeat. Take extra time and test the waters before diving in. Exercising a little patience can prevent you from getting in over your head too quickly. Taskmaster Saturn is opposing your key planet Venus, demanding that you're sincere in your efforts. Thankfully, your persistence is an integral part of your success."
gemini,2014-06-12,A close friendship or love affair can hit a speed bump today as illusions give way to the stark reality of the situation. It's not that things are that bad; it's just that you need to address unresolved issues before you return to pursuing pleasure. Listening with an open mind now is just as important as speaking your piece. You stand to learn something constructive about yourself if you are secure enough to hear what's being said.  A change of attitude can turn an obstacle into an opportunity.
cancer,2014-06-12,"You may be doing better financially and professionally than in the romance department, but complications could still surface where you least expect them. The problem is that your feelings might not fit into your current workplace. You know there is a simple answer, but today you just have to deal with your own sense of limitations if resolution isn't yet in sight. Acknowledging your emotions is more productive now than trying to change anything in your environment. Keeping your heart open isn't always easy but it's the right thing to do."
leo,2014-06-12,"Gracefully accepting the restrictions being placed on you empowers you to make the best of your current dynamics. A radical approach to expressing your needs turns a tricky situation into a positive one, even if a black cloud appears above you to block the sunshine today. But grabbing an umbrella won't necessarily keep you dry on a day like this. Instead of shielding yourself from the storm, your lesson now is to learn how to sing in the rain. Ultimately, your attitude makes all the difference in the world."
virgo,2014-06-12,"At first, you may be overly idealistic about your professional aspirations, but current obligations prevent you from losing touch with reality. Even if you do get a chance to escape for a bit of recreation, you still might not enjoy hanging out with your friends or family as much as you wish. However, the stress you experience now can be channeled productively if you set realistic goals, make a plan and stick to it. Establishing a sustainable pace at work is your best route to success."
libra,2014-06-12,"You can be your own worst enemy today, although you could skillfully blame the current circumstances on someone else. Sobering Saturn hands a reality check to romantic Venus and your temporary resistance to experiencing pleasure might play out in the realm of relationships. If you need to pull back emotionally now, take full responsibility for your feelings; what you say influences others more than you know. But don't forget, stepping out of your comfort zone could lead to a lasting connection."
scorpio,2014-06-12,"Your resistance to an authority figure could create tension today, especially if you don't acknowledge your role in the stressful dynamics. Perhaps, in your eagerness, you overlooked a critical piece of the puzzle and you need a reminder to see the whole picture. Don't shoot the messenger; it's possible that others are being hard on you because they respect you enough to tell you the truth."
sagittarius,2014-06-12,"Although you have high hopes for your future, an interesting dilemma could complicate your agenda today. You truly want to make progress toward your goals, but your efforts might not be enough to change the current trajectory. However, you don't have to see this setback as a personal failure; it's not a reflection of your capabilities. Your character is being tested at this time; long-term solutions come from common sense and perspiration now rather than from inspiration."
capricorn,2014-06-12,"It might seem as if the reason for your current predicament is a lack of resources now, but it could also stem from an underlying fear of forming close emotional ties. Perhaps you have gone to extreme measures to keep your heart safe and are having a tough time integrating the expectations of others. Hold onto your long-term goals and trust your recent decisions. The blockages you face today will not outlive your dreams if you're willing to take a risk and let down your guard."
aquarius,2014-06-12,"Walls of resistance that have sprung up around you may not be an indication that you are on a wrong track. The problem could originate from an overdue attitude correction, instead. Someone might get on your case if he or she thinks you're not working hard enough. But don't worry too much about the judgment of others. Get serious, focus strictly on the business at hand and your efforts will likely be appreciated in the long run."
pisces,2014-06-12,"You may be singing the blues today, but this is no reason to slip into denial. It's just that you might believe you have to temporarily set your feelings aside in order to achieve your goals. However, if you do try to suppress your emotions, it's unlikely that you'll reach your destination any quicker -- and you won't enjoy yourself as much once you get there. No shortcuts for you now; do the work and the pleasure will follow."
aries,2014-06-13,"Your enterprising approach to life colors your day with optimism, yet you still have the good sense to meet reality head on. The Sagittarius Full Moon brightens your 9th House of Big Ideas, but circumstances don't make it easy to hold on to your ideals. Everything seems more complicated now than it should be, even if you have a plan in place. It's essential to remain open to the possibility that your desires will change over the days ahead. But don't let anyone rain on your parade; determination and perseverance are more important than ever."
taurus,2014-06-13,"You might be vacillating between having a good time and experiencing the depth of your feelings today. The Sagittarius Full Moon lands in your 8th House of Intimacy, reminding you to enjoy sensual delights without retreating from the fear of sharing too much. Your discomfort with intensity is based, at least partly, on your desire for simplicity. Sometimes the only way to recapture a less complicated existence is to go through a phase of increased complexity. Don't withdraw from your emotions, for this process will lead to the stability you seek."
gemini,2014-06-13,"Naturally, you are intrigued by a variety of interests and you love to flit from one clever thought to the next. But today's expansive Sagittarius Full Moon lights up your 7th House of Relationships, amplifying the emotions of those close to you. However, you might resist the flow of feelings and even doubt your desirability. Stop collecting data and start acting on what you already know to be true. It's time to get out of your head and into your heart."
cancer,2014-06-13,"You don't always express your desires to others -- even those you love and trust. Unfortunately, this overly cautious strategy minimizes your chances of being fully satisfied in a relationship. Your assumption that someone should just know what you need isn't the way it works in the real world. Today's outgoing Sagittarius Full Moon in your 6th House of Habits empowers you to step out of your comfort zone. You can improve your chances for fulfillment if you put your feelings out in the open. Honest communication in a relationship builds a solid foundation for continued growth."
leo,2014-06-13,"You are overdue for a little romance in your life, but you must meet your previous commitments first if you really want to enjoy yourself. The adventurous Sagittarius Full Moon highlights your 5th House of Play, emphasizing your current desire to open your heart and let someone in. Just be certain that you know exactly what you're getting yourself into before taking things to the next level. Making a list of the potential risks versus rewards can help you decide whether or not to move forward in the game of love."
virgo,2014-06-13,"You may feel stressed today, but the tension can push you into some very dynamic situations. Although you might not be as relaxed as you wish, the Sagittarius Full Moon falls in your 4th House of Security, prompting you to seek clarity in professional and personal relationships. Concerns about your career could dredge up old fears and emotional insecurities. Thankfully, they have less power once they are seen in the light of day. You have the power to transform negative patterns into positive actions once and for all."
libra,2014-06-13,"You could feel very far away from the harmonious interactions that you crave, but don't worry about what you might be missing now. The Sagittarius Full Moon spotlights your 3rd House of Communication, enabling you to express what you want from relationships. You're experiencing a higher level of intensity now, but don't try to light up the darkness too quickly or you may prevent the most powerful magic from coming to fruition. Channel your passion into creating a viable plan for the future. Controlled growth is more sustainable than a sudden breakthrough."
scorpio,2014-06-13,"Facing your fears can place you into a new relationship with your beliefs. You can't easily love others or expect them to love you if you don't fully love yourself. Thankfully, today's colorful Sagittarius Full Moon brings inspiration to your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, encouraging you to see yourself in a new light. You have the power to eliminate old tapes that are playing outmoded songs. Don't wait for a better time to dance to the music; create a new soundtrack for your life while the planets are working in your favor."
sagittarius,2014-06-13,"Your intensity can be a lot to handle today and others might tiptoe around you so they don't trigger your temper. Today's Full Moon occurs in your exuberant sign, prompting you to go the extra mile when making your point. You're not interested in being placated; instead, you want your partners and friends to understand your truth. Just remember that everyone doesn't think like you, and your opinions may not be perceived to be as important as you believe they are. You can be the life of the party if you turn off the rhetoric and tone down your volume just a notch."
capricorn,2014-06-13,"You have been relatively satisfied with your daily routine recently, but today you are less sure about your selected path in life as the Sagittarius Full Moon illuminates your 12th House of Destiny. Give yourself permission to go through the process of self-doubt, but recognize that this is just a temporary phase. Your task now is to gain an objective perspective on your current habits so that you can begin to eliminate the ones keeping you from achieving your highest potential."
aquarius,2014-06-13,"You have a deep understanding of the power of the collective and you can play your knowledge to your advantage now. The Sagittarius Moon shines in your 11th House of Social Networking, enabling you to intuitively know what the group needs to thrive. Using your charm helps you get what you want, but be careful about stirring up emotionally charged material. You might not even be aware of the psychological buttons you are pushing today. Remember, there's nothing wrong with keeping the energy light and easy, especially when things are going your way."
pisces,2014-06-13,"You're conflicted about whether or not you want to be in the spotlight now. The carefree Sagittarius Full Moon floods your 10th House of Status, allowing you to feel comfortable on stage or in a public arena. However, the Moon opposes the Sun in your 4th House of Home and Family, encouraging you to keep a lower profile. Even if you're working behind the scenes and you don't want the world to see your accomplishments, it's still time to own the power that you have rightfully earned."
aries,2014-06-14,"Giving your emotions enough time to settle down is a great idea in theory, even if it isn't an easy path to follow in practice. You may be moody today and fixing for a fight, especially if circumstances aren't going your way. However, you might be hard-pressed to find a sensible target for your aggression. Instead of losing your cool, take several deep breaths and chill out. Although physical exercise can reduce your stress, expressing your truth now is still essential to your overall well-being."
taurus,2014-06-14,"This seems like a great day for a quick getaway, but you might not have the chance to actually follow through with your plans. Even if you can't get out of town, go ahead and create small pockets of time for spiritual rejuvenation. Being alone for a while enables you to center your energy. Try taking a walk, sitting in meditation or practicing yoga. No matter how busy you are today, make space to listen to your own inner voice rather than succumbing to the stressful demands of others."
gemini,2014-06-14,"Relaxing doesn't usually come easy to you and today it's even harder if you're dealing with an extra layer of stress. Thankfully, you correctly sense that things are changing for the better, but the energy won't turn around overnight. You might feel as if others will be in your way for a while longer. In the meantime, don't vent your annoyance on innocent bystanders or ignore the dynamics that are triggering your current resentment. Avoid acting on extreme emotions; instead, create a middle path and try to stay on it the best you can."
cancer,2014-06-14,"Although you feel the positive energy coming from within your heart today, annoying distractions prevent you from being as happy-go-lucky as you like. Perhaps someone is placing unreasonable demands on you or trying to manipulate your emotions, drawing you into an unexpected argument. Ironically, you could make the best leader of all if you're simply willing to speak up and fight for your beliefs. Make a stand; your heart won't steer you wrong."
leo,2014-06-14,"Your passions are swimming through some very deep waters today and you might feel uncomfortable if others unwittingly jump into your emotional turmoil. Your confidence is a bit shaky now, but your actions could tell a very different story as you courageously roar your way through the day. Remember that false bravado won't make your certainty return any sooner; it only alienates you from those who want to help. Displaying your vulnerability can be a positive step toward developing greater intimacy."
virgo,2014-06-14,"Nothing is gained by pushing the river, for the water ultimately arrives at the sea in its own perfect time. The same now applies to your life; don't push others to react faster than they can, for it won't help your cause as you move into the next phase of your life. Instead, remain intellectually open and emotionally flexible. People are more willing to cooperate with you when they feel supported by your actions and encouraged by your words."
libra,2014-06-14,"It's nearly impossible to escape an intense emotional interaction with someone close to you as you confront the gulf between your thoughts and your feelings. Nevertheless, take a chance and open up to another person now, instead of accusing them of upsetting your day. But compromise isn't possible if you only look at things from one perspective. Avoid being too dependent on logic alone because you need both the objective and subjective sides of reality to round out your experience today."
scorpio,2014-06-14,"Social interactions might stir up your latent insecurities, adding another layer of drama to an already intense day. You may feel as if you are engaged in a battle that you must win, but actually your fears fuel the flames today. There's nothing to be gained from overreacting with unrestrained passion now as Mars and Pluto -- your two key planets -- duke it out. Seek ways to salve the open wounds rather than irritating them further. Consciously slowing down your own emotional roller coaster enables you to stop the ride before things get out of control."
sagittarius,2014-06-14,"You may feel a rush of adrenaline today, but the high won't last very long. Even if you believe that you have passed through the eye of the storm, there is still more turmoil heading your way. There are bigger issues developing on the horizon and you might just make the situation worse by bringing an unresolved matter to a premature conclusion. Let the energy take its own course without trying to control the outcome. Forewarned is forearmed."
capricorn,2014-06-14,"Your opinions are much stronger now that you're developing a fresh perspective on the events of the past few days. But your current view of reality may be distorted by your unexpressed emotions. You struggle between the thoughts in your head and the desires of your heart, leaving you unsure about which path to take. Lean on your friends for support today, instead of pushing them away. Trusting someone else is the first step to regaining your clarity and rediscovering your route to happiness."
aquarius,2014-06-14,"Fire up your intellect for a little bit of excitement now and break out of old routines wherever you go. Enjoy the show as you actively engage everyone around you to gain perspective on your own feelings. However, avoid any negotiations that require emotional detachment today, since it's difficult to separate your logical thoughts from your irrational needs. You are happiest now when your heart is fully engaged."
pisces,2014-06-14,"Your passions are so intense today that you're willing to take a risk in an email exchange or a real world conversation with someone you want to know better. Listen to your heart, even if you hear your fears trying to talk you out of expressing your desires. The first move may be hard to make but it's worth it in the end. Just remember to give others enough latitude so they can be comfortable to share whatever they feel, too."
aries,2014-06-15,"You may have just enough cool logic to make an effective plan, but your heated emotions might still get in the way of what you want to accomplish today. Even if you think you can override your desires, they just reappear in the form of a projection if you try to suppress them. Pay extra attention to the tone of your voice if you disagree with someone now; an aggressive nature could indicate you have unexpressed feelings that are working their way to the surface. A kinder and gentler approach to sharing your thoughts eases the pressure all the way around."
taurus,2014-06-15,"You have errands to run today and the sooner you get started, the better you will feel about your accomplishments. Unfortunately, some chores take longer than you expect, which could have a cascading effect on your schedule. Nevertheless, it's best to take your tasks one at a time without panicking and trying to do too much at once. Keep in mind this might not be the best time to start a new project. Creating closure is more important now than planning your next move."
gemini,2014-06-15,"Although you wish you could do whatever you want today, you don't have the luxury of following your heart's desire. You might be happier if you didn't have so many obligations to fulfill, but there are plenty of chores demanding your attention. Get serious about practicing self-discipline because everything you do now sets the tone for the rest of the month. Making progress is easy if you can cleverly turn your work into play."
cancer,2014-06-15,"You tend to be hesitant about personal disclosure, yet you're still willing to work closely with others in pursuit of your goals. Meanwhile, your coworkers may be impressed by your emotional warmth today, even if you are feeling more reserved than they know. Although it's wise to keep healthy boundaries, don't go overboard in hiding your vulnerability. Let down your guard; surprisingly, your peers can be more supportive than you expect."
leo,2014-06-15,"Friends and associates seem emotionally detached today, putting you back in touch with old fears of abandonment. But it's crucial to separate your fantasies that are based upon painful memories from what's actually happening in the present moment. Even if your feelings have been recently agitated by someone you love, don't take it personally now if current relationship dynamics require a bit of a cooling-off period. Having enough room to breathe might be just what the doctor ordered for everyone involved."
virgo,2014-06-15,"Even if you have an ambitious plan to mount a carefully choreographed attack on several projects all at once, your day may take a sharp turn into unknown territory. Taking a methodical approach to getting things done is a smart idea at first, but you might grow bored with doing everything the same old way. Add some excitement to your day by trying something completely new. But don't wait until it's too late; take action now while you still have time to savor the experience."
libra,2014-06-15,"You may feel the heaviness lifting today as the main source of your tension is temporarily removed. You're eager to take one more shot at affecting significant change at home or in your career, but a serious issue on your agenda isn't going away so fast. Thankfully, you have been granted an extension to a deadline, giving you additional time to sort out your priorities. Don't waste this opportunity or you'll be sorry you did when the stress returns down the road."
scorpio,2014-06-15,"Acknowledging the gulf between your new found freedom and unfulfilled commitments may leave you feeling uneasy. You're caught in the middle of a large-scale tug-of-war with conflicting situations vying for your attention. But it's not an all-or-nothing game; you can't just pick one side over the other. Instead, balance the opposing forces as well as you can, trusting that the stress will eventually settle back down once you roll up your sleeves and willingly address the unresolved issues."
sagittarius,2014-06-15,"If you're trying to get a handle on your life by making plans for the future, it's time to be practical and put one single idea into motion today. Don't worry about reaching your destination immediately since it could be a long distance from where you are currently standing. For now, just take one tiny piece of the puzzle and fit it into your present life. The larger pieces will fall into place later on if you have faith in yourself and trust in the process."
capricorn,2014-06-15,You're receiving mixed messages from the cosmos today as you attempt to build on your recent accomplishments. But yesterday's project may need to be set aside for a while as older unfinished business cycles back through your life. You can't move ahead with your current goals until you tighten up the loose ends that are beginning to fray. Creating sensible priorities now is the first step toward putting your life back in order.
aquarius,2014-06-15,"Managing your personal and professional relationships is crucial now, because you can't reach your goals without having a reliable support system in place. The Moon's return to your eclectic sign is a cosmic reminder that you have to do things your own way, but you cannot just ignore the wishes of your friends and co-workers. The healthiest strategy is to creatively balance your non-conformist tendencies with your innate need to be a part of a larger community. The good news is you don't have to sacrifice your individuality to be an integral member of the team."
pisces,2014-06-15,"Although your dreams successfully mix the past, present and future, you regain your sense of reality once you awaken. There's nothing wrong with visualizing what's ahead as long as you continue to participate in the real world. Thankfully, the Moon's current visit to your 12th House of Soul Consciousness helps you recognize the power of now. Yesterday and tomorrow do not exist; they are constructs of the human mind. In the meantime, it all comes down to cultivating faith. Believing is seeing."
aries,2014-06-16,"Reexamining the most important relationships in your life is a smart idea today. Even if you think that all is harmonious, you may be looking at life through a Pollyanna lens. Instead of falling back on your natural confidence now, stop and check in with those most significant to you. Simply ask others how they feel about your connection and then listen closely to what they tell you. You might be quite surprised by what you hear, but you can make important improvements if you take what you learn to heart."
taurus,2014-06-16,"You might feel less freedom of movement today because you have so many tasks to complete for work. You could even be willing to take a foolish chance just to shake things up. Luckily, you're capable of moderating your emotional expression once you have a specific goal in mind. Giving yourself permission to fantasize about your escape enables you to continue on the same path until your current restlessness dissipates. Remember, there's no need to turn your life upside down in pursuit of a pipe dream; there's joy to be found in your everyday surroundings."
gemini,2014-06-16,"You can't wait to jump in and learn as much as you can about something new today. Fortunately, you could absorb the basics of a difficult discipline or a technical skill quite quickly and are eager to show others how clever you are. But an impressive performance isn't enough, so consider how to take your brilliant ideas and transform them into something that's actually real. Make the best of this moment and manifest your dreams."
cancer,2014-06-16,"You could be feeling disappointed or regretful today and it may be challenging to settle your thoughts. Your worries weigh heavy on in your mind, making it hard to filter out the extraneous noise. But don't be too self-judgmental; it's natural to be fearful when so much is unknown about your future. The best thing you can do now is to pay attention to your heart's desire while you continue experiencing the unfolding mysteries of your life. Forgiveness is the first step to moving on."
leo,2014-06-16,"People around you may be acting strangely today as the quirky Aquarius Moon travels through your 7th House of Others. But some of the weird behavior that you observe might be more reflective of your own desire to do something out of the box. Claim your power by telling others what you want, instead of projecting your need for independence and unconventionality onto them. Let your true colors shine through."
virgo,2014-06-16,"It may be socially awkward to share your strong feelings for someone today, but you could end up regretting your actions if you let fear prevent you from expressing what's in your heart. You're being pulled in two directions now and no matter what you do, you might wish you took the other course. Thankfully, just knowing that there is no single correct path enables you to be more accepting of the outcome. You don't have to force a final decision yet; trust your instincts to tell you when the time is right."
libra,2014-06-16,"You would like to believe that all is well in the kingdom and that everyone is doing fine. However, this fantasy may not be the entire story today as negativity from a recent interaction leaks over into current events. Although you're the one who usually plays the role of peacemaker, it currently falls on you to stir up a bit of trouble. Don't worry about what others think. It's your job now to act as the heavyweight and talk about those subjects that everyone else is avoiding. It's better to address the issues now than receiving an unpleasant reality check down the road."
scorpio,2014-06-16,"You feel optimistic about your role in the world right now even if your place doesn't seem overly important in the big scheme of things. Thankfully, you can still see the positive impact that you have on others on a day-to-day basis. Remember, success comes in many shapes and sizes. Fame and fortune are on one end of the spectrum while personal meaning and spiritual growth are on the other. Don't judge yourself by the expectations of others; instead, pick your own path and follow your heart."
sagittarius,2014-06-16,"So many activities sound like fun today that it's difficult to decide how to spend your leisure time. You love the idea of playing with your friends; however, the Moon's dynamic square to stern Saturn could put the brakes on your social plans. Fortunately, you can get ahead of the responsibility curve with more effective long-term planning. Return to pursuing pleasure later; for now, it's time to get serious about your future and commit to achieving your goals."
capricorn,2014-06-16,"Money matters may be taking up more of your time these days, but new opportunities for growth and happiness make it challenging to concentrate on the material world alone. Nevertheless, professional responsibilities are calling, and you can't say no today. Being preoccupied with your personal life doesn't make following a career path any easier. Avoid making any major financial decisions until the current distractions pass. Take care of business but leave enough wiggle room to change your mind."
aquarius,2014-06-16,"Weird thoughts are exploding in your brain today, challenging you to figure out exactly what to do today. You want to take each and every idea and run with it, but you cannot possibly finish everything you start now. Be careful, for you could initiate action on enough projects to keep you busy for a very long time. However, don't stress if you still have lots of loose ends by the end of the day. You still have time over the next couple of weeks -- during Mercury's retrograde phase -- to wrap up incomplete business."
pisces,2014-06-16,"You may be feeling uncomfortable as you face a predicament in your personal life. Although you sense that something is wrong, you can't quite put your finger on it. At first there seems to be no quick way out of your current circumstances. However, you have superpowers now that allow you to pull one of your magic disappearing acts. Just don't try to do too much all at once. Keep in mind that everything doesn't have to happen overnight; any positive changes you make, however small, helps your cause."
aries,2014-06-17,"Your thoughts are spinning around like hamsters on a wheel, making it nearly impossible to get any traction. You can't figure out what you're doing wrong when Mercury retrogrades back into jittery Gemini. Instead of trying to make anything special happen, it's best to enjoy the speed at which your ideas seem to run around in your head, even if you don't gain much progress now. Accept the present circumstances as they are until the ride slows down enough to let you jump off. Inspiration is currently more important than productivity."
taurus,2014-06-17,"Even if you seem to be calm, cool and collected to your friends at work, communication issues might surface if anyone jumps to quick conclusions about you today. Beneath your mellow veneer, you could be a complicated bundle of nerves, yet you most likely will keep your insecurities to yourself now. Instead of trying to quiet your thoughts, allow yourself to be entertained by them without having to say anything at all. Let others think what they want; the pressure dissipates once you commit to being true to yourself."
gemini,2014-06-17,"You can't find the off-switch for your brain today and too much mental activity can be exhausting. But setting a moderate pace in the morning keeps the creativity flowing all day long. Nevertheless, you still might notice a midday shift in the content of your thoughts when the Moon slips into surreal Pisces. Don't try to control your stream of consciousness; let it drift without any interference. Your best ideas come to you now when you're lost in fantasies. Your imagination holds the key to your future success."
cancer,2014-06-17,"You might feel very reclusive today while the rest of the world appears to be in frenetic motion. You know something momentous  is about to happen and can't help but wonder if you should spend more time in preparation. Nevertheless, the super sensitive Pisces Moon reminds you that it is wiser to wait a few days before pushing your agenda ahead, even if you're restless now. Don't worry about being judged by others; trust your intuition and follow your heart."
leo,2014-06-17,"You're anxious to begin something new today, but your impatience may have you missing an important piece of the puzzle. Fortunately, you can navigate the many variations between smooth success and risky business if you aren't in such a hurry. An exciting ride to an unknown place is in front of you, so don't ruin it by failing to take the time to consider the consequences of your actions. A little advanced planning doesn't have to spoil the fun."
virgo,2014-06-17,"Talking about your feelings before you conduct your careful analysis of the facts may be more problematic than constructive today. You could forget to consider how someone might react to your bold ideas, only to be surprised with the speed at which the emotional landscape changes. It's awkward at first to push through the nervous tension, but once you have a game plan in place, speaking from the heart can move things in the right direction a lot faster than you expect."
libra,2014-06-17,"Attempting to keep to yourself to get your chores done probably won't work today. You're likely to be drawn out of your escape mode before you can fully disappear. It's quite a challenge to focus on your responsibilities when there are so many lovely distractions occurring throughout the day. Engaging in fascinating conversations with creative people is much more fun than the drudgery of your daily routine. Paradoxically, you might accomplish more when you're still plugged into the world around you. Find a way to balance business with pleasure for the best results."
scorpio,2014-06-17,"You may be experiencing emotional dissonance today as you attempt to reconcile your desire to be compassionate with your annoyance of others at work. Unfortunately, your associates might not be holding up their end of the deal, yet you still want to encourage everyone to contribute as best as he or she can. You are perceptive enough to see the most efficient way to perform a task and you have no problem assuming authority to get the job done. Keep in mind that you cannot control others; ironically, you can find peace by changing your expectations, instead."
sagittarius,2014-06-17,"You can cleverly invent many ways to avoid your obligations today as if you still have a lingering case of spring fever. However, pursuing pleasure is difficult because your mundane responsibilities won't just disappear on their own. Nevertheless, you still might be able to talk your way into a sweet situation by capitalizing on your current charm. Just don't push your luck too far or you could run into bigger problems later when trying to complete your unfinished work."
capricorn,2014-06-17,"Although you might find yourself recycling yesterday's ideas, the best ones will be even better today. Fortunately, there's a cooperative connection between your head and your heart now, so it's easier to gain clarity on your dreams. But don't worry too much about being practical; there will be plenty of opportunity for that later on. Nevertheless, it's wise to write down your thoughts as they occur without pushing your agenda on anyone else. Develop your plans but wait until the logistics make sense before you put them into action."
aquarius,2014-06-17,"It's great to see everything click into place today -- especially when you are packing so much life into a short amount of time. But don't add too many new activities to your schedule or you'll suddenly be overbooked before you know it. Make a conscious choice to lessen your load by moving an appointment or two to another day when you may have more flexibility. Ultimately, allowing room for the unexpected gives you space to breathe when you need it the most."
pisces,2014-06-17,"Integrating all the changes that seem to occur daily is quite a monumental task. If you have been secretly hoping for the pace to slow down, you may temporarily get your wish. Although you won't necessarily have total control over the specific timeline, everything will flow smoother now if you are less demanding of yourself and others. Simply by acknowledging that everyone deserves a break helps to lighten the atmosphere for all involved. Being kind never hurt anyone."
aries,2014-06-18,"You're extremely confident about your life now, but someone might say something that tugs on your conscience. Although you may not have any reasons to feel guilty, you dislike being misunderstood. Naturally, you want to clarify your position before moving on, so don't put off important communication for a later date. Attend to any unresolved issues as quickly as you can, so you are ready for the action-packed times ahead."
taurus,2014-06-18,"Positive feedback from your friends and colleagues strengthens your feelings and lifts your spirits today. Luckily, your key planet Venus receives an emotional boost from generous Jupiter, encouraging you to feel even better about yourself and those you love. However, this is no time to stand on ceremony or harbor false pride; willingly accept recognition and support from others when it's offered, even if you didn't ask for it. Don't resist the inevitable; it's your turn to shine."
gemini,2014-06-18,"It seems as if you're on an energetic roll now. Or, maybe, you think you should be preparing for something really big that's just around the next corner. You can sense change is in the air, even if worries or fears linger at the edge of your awareness. Today's thoughts shape tomorrow's destiny, so visualize the most amazing possibilities in front of you. Tying up loose ends from your past helps to prevent anything from standing in the way of your future."
cancer,2014-06-18,"Even if your life seems to be unfolding as planned, you still aren't sure that you should trust any good news you hear today. Unfortunately, you might also learn something that raises your concern. You may overcompensate by gathering all the information you can find to justify your positive perspective. However, you really don't need any more data; just make a choice and then take a few healthy steps in the direction you want to go. Follow your heart and don't look back."
leo,2014-06-18,"Your friends and associates ride to your rescue just in the nick of time, even if you committed to more than you can possibly deliver now. Fortunately, they bring you more than good cheer and emotional support; your allies are also willing to volunteer a fair amount of hard work. Don't be greedy about personal profit or recognition since it's karmically crucial to share the rewards with those who contribute to your success. In the meantime, showing your appreciation makes everyone feel like part of the team."
virgo,2014-06-18,"Working extra hard to put everything in order might be a lost cause today, especially if other people seem to be preoccupied with their own dreams. It sounds like a practical idea to prioritize your goals and then make a list of the steps needed to reach them. Unfortunately, concrete plans aren't all that useful because so much seems to be occurring at once, leaving little time for detailed analysis. Let go and trust your intuition; acting on your feelings will bring you as much success now as any other strategy."
libra,2014-06-18,"You can see the positive in almost every situation today, even on the job, as aesthetically pleasing Venus harmonizes with propitious Jupiter in your 10th House of Career. You might be considered for a promotion or, at least, acknowledged for your hard work. Your optimism is on the rise now, along with your income potential. Just don't be presumptuous and expect too much too soon. Nevertheless, set sail with your ambitions; rest assured that the winds of positive change are blowing in your direction."
scorpio,2014-06-18,"You could miss an unexpected opportunity to share an amazing experience with a close friend today if you overreact to what is said. There is little doubt that this is a strange day, but your morning apprehension need not detract from the beauty that you perceive around you. Instead of seeking depth and intensity now, keep the mood light and easy so you can relax and enjoy yourself. Ultimately, the potential for pleasure abounds if you release your fears and open your heart."
sagittarius,2014-06-18,"Instead of escaping from your daily routine, you prefer exploring alternatives to make your job more fun -- and that could include other people. Although everyone around you seems to be submerged in their own worlds, you wish they had more time for you. Thankfully, beneficent Jupiter is supporting resourceful Venus in your 6th House of Work, enabling you to enjoy meeting your obligations rather than avoiding them. Don't worry about anyone else; honoring your commitments ultimately brings its own kind of quiet satisfaction."
capricorn,2014-06-18,"You may be up for a raise or, perhaps, you simply receive an appreciative thanks from someone at work as lucky Jupiter harmonizes with lovely Venus in your 2nd House of Money today. Naturally, a boost in your salary is wonderful, but a heartfelt acknowledgment from your boss is validating, too. However, you need to come to terms with the simple fact that your contribution is of considerable value. Don't be shy about accepting praise now; displaying too much doubt can cause you to miss a chance to bask in the limelight and take pride in your work."
aquarius,2014-06-18,"You believe your aim is true today and you're right on target; nevertheless, your unflagging optimism may seem overwhelming to everyone else. Although you are the epitome of the power of positive thinking now, someone might try to rain on your parade. There's no need to give away your authority. Being strong and sensitive in your approach enables you to make room for others who are struggling to hold their position, too."
pisces,2014-06-18,"You could be lost in a hazy dream world, so it's wise to pinch yourself a few times during the day just to remind yourself that you're actually awake. Although you probably have good cause for your rosy outlook, it's important to maintain a clear sense of reality now or you might set yourself up for disappointment later on. Avoiding extremes is a challenging task today unless you have someone in your life that you trust enough to use as a sounding board. Asking for advice is one thing, but following it is another."
aries,2014-06-19,"Worrying about all the possible negative paths a relationship could take is a waste of your energy today, yet you might not be able to simply turn off the noise in your head. This may feel like a very familiar theme and chances are that you are here again only because you've been here before. Realizing how your present condition is vastly different from the past one can help you move beyond your fears and release you from the vicious cycle. Awareness of your personal history frees you from having to repeat it."
taurus,2014-06-19,"If someone approaches you with a big idea today, don't close down before you give it a fair shake. Obviously you're not interested in chasing windmills, but you could inadvertently say no to an innovative plan just because you were recently burned by another grandiose scheme. Remain open-minded so you can weigh what you hear on its own merits and then act accordingly. Don't look a gift horse in the mouth."
gemini,2014-06-19,"Keeping your thoughts quiet might feel safer than sharing them, but the isolation you manifest today may be completely unnecessary. The real problem isn't what you are thinking, but how you communicate your ideas now. Don't attempt to make anyone else responsible for your feelings or expect someone to solve your dilemma. Others won't be able to fix your problem, but they can listen and be supportive of your process. There's no need to prove anything by carrying your burden alone."
cancer,2014-06-19,"You might attempt to take total responsibility for a misunderstanding, but somehow your good intentions still could get muddled. Others may misinterpret your words today, even if you think you're being very clear when explaining your motives. The more you say, the more entangled it all becomes now. Quit trying so hard to justify your actions; a simple apology should suffice as long as your heart is in the right place."
leo,2014-06-19,"You may as well put in extra effort this morning, for it could be your best chance today to get some real work done. Your new plan of attack might be an excellent one, but it's still highly likely that you'll run into more obstacles later in the day. Don't be self-critical if you fall short of your own expectations now. Get plenty of rest tonight; tomorrow is a brand new day."
virgo,2014-06-19,"You are capable of secretly holding onto an old wound for too long, even after you've forgiven everyone involved and allegedly moved on. But even if you can detach from your personal pain, it's not necessarily the smartest strategy for happy living. You have an opportunity to create change now; yet it might require that you look back one more time. Once you have relearned your lesson and passed the test, you will finally get to take things to the next level. You can't embrace your future until you have fully dealt with your past."
libra,2014-06-19,"You could lose your patience very quickly today if you believe that someone is trying to pull the wool over your eyes. But even if you don't know exactly what kind of tricks others are up to now, you can clearly tell the difference between fact and fiction. Trust your inner voice more than anyone else's advice; your intuition won't lead you wrong as long as you maintain a modicum of objectivity along the way."
scorpio,2014-06-19,"This is a transition day for you, so finish up your current projects so you can be ready for an interesting new opportunity. The sparks of excitement may already be flying in your mind, but you can't make your enthusiasm last longer by exerting control over all the variables in your environment. Your best move now is to temporarily let go of your previous agenda and simply be as spontaneous as possible. The real magic comes from living in the present moment rather than engineering your future."
sagittarius,2014-06-19,"You wish you could take it easy today so you have the chance to integrate recent breakthroughs into your creative process. However, you probably won't get the peace and quiet you seek, even if your morning starts out slowly. You may be your own worst enemy now as you wrestle with emotional ghosts from your past. Fortunately, you can end an unrewarding pattern by talking about your concerns with an understanding friend. Working through your feelings is a more productive use of your time in the long run."
capricorn,2014-06-19,"It seems as if the clock is ticking and there's not much time left to untangle a couple of loose ends; unfortunately, you might have to leave some things unfinished before moving on to what's next. Don't fret about incomplete projects since you may have time over the next few weeks to revisit what's been left undone. For now, just do the best job you can without being too much of a critic when judging your own accomplishments. Practicing compassion includes being gentle with yourself."
aquarius,2014-06-19,"Your day has a split personality -- coming in like a lamb and going out like a lion. A roar of energy occurs midday when the Moon marches into feisty Aries, reminding you of your warrior nature. You may decide early on to adopt a spiritual approach and not force your ideas onto others. However your laid-back demeanor only lasts so long; when you decide it's time to make your move, at least do so with kindness and awareness. An act of courage doesn't have to be delivered at the tip of a sword."
pisces,2014-06-19,"Your upbeat manner just might be your clever tactic of covering a growing insecurity. However, others probably won't even notice that you're faking your way through the day. Examine your motives behind your false optimism later. Believe it or not, it's best to go ahead and share your feelings now, resigning yourself to dealing with the consequences as they unfold. Playing your cards too close to your chest may be worse than not playing them at all."
aries,2014-06-20,"You're itching to take a risk today, prompting you to turn things upside down to make your point, if necessary. Prepare for the pace to pick up, for your life might feel as if it's in a heightened state of emergency. Be ready to interact with anyone who crosses your path, for it is your current sense of urgency that assures your success. Just remember that everything is cyclical; the energy will settle down next week. Make the most of this intensity while it lasts."
taurus,2014-06-20,"Your day begins calmly enough, but by evening you may have stepped all the way out to the edge of your comfort zone. Thankfully, you could be offered an opportunity to find your way back home quite soon, but for now you must remain as flexible as possible. The roller coaster is twisting and turning on its tracks and your most important job is to hang on until it stops. Once you get over your fear of the uncertainty, you might enjoy yourself more than you can imagine. Embrace the surprises along the way."
gemini,2014-06-20,"Expecting the unexpected is as paradoxical as your entire day. Wildly eccentric Uranus electrifies your key planet Mercury, destabilizing your assumptions. It may even feel as if the ground upon which you stand won't support you. You can regain your stability by swiftly adapting to those things you cannot change or preemptively changing those things you can. Either way, firm up your foundation before adding more complexity to your life."
cancer,2014-06-20,"You might be overwhelmed by the busyness of your life as you unsuccessfully attempt to find comfort in all the noise. Although you aren't going to solve your problems overnight, you still could benefit by getting them out into the open. Buried issues can shatter through the resistance today. If you are seeking change, don't wait for a better moment; this could be it."
leo,2014-06-20,"You may wake up on the wrong side of the bed today because you have so many things to do. Oddly enough, the steadiest of routines could be the first ones to unravel. Longstanding emotional tension brewing beneath the surface is now the source of crisis. Most likely there won't be one single major conflict, but rather a series of problems requiring your undivided attention. For best results, maintain your focus and take care of each issue as it arises. Keeping your sense of humor close at hand just might save the day."
virgo,2014-06-20,"Your hectic schedule is just one indicator of your vibrant mental state these days, yet the lively pace might not settle down as soon as you wish. You might secretly worry that your life is spinning out of control -- and your best strategy is to let the chips fall as they may. Attempts to regain control can just lead to more frustration now. Seek creative ways to express your unique individuality instead of trying to conform to the norm. Be true to yourself and the reach for the stars."
libra,2014-06-20,"The good times aren't necessarily over but there is too much work to be done and you can't ignore your responsibilities any longer. However, even with the best of intentions, you won't be able to fulfill all your commitments today. The loose ends are like the mythical many-headed Hydra who would grow two more heads each time one was cut off. Complexity could be unraveling as fast as you are simplifying it. Try not to get too stressed out by all the drama. You can always put everything back in its place tomorrow."
scorpio,2014-06-20,"Fortunately, you can experience the pleasurable benefits of some of your favorite things today, including exploring the unknowable mysteries of life. But resolving your current dilemma isn't as critical as you think. Instead of exhausting yourself attempting to emerge as the hero or heroine, admit you don't have an exclusive on the truth. There's no need to uncover the ultimate answer now. Instead, be receptive to little flashes of awareness along the way to discovering the truth."
sagittarius,2014-06-20,"The world seems kinder to you today as your spirit soars with expectations outside of the ordinary. Still, your positive thoughts may be challenged by a flow of surprising twists and turns, which can be difficult if you are too rigid in your thinking. However, the good can become even better if you remain open to the flurry of changes. Remember, it's just not as important to be right as it is to be adaptable to new perspectives. Flexibility is your friend."
capricorn,2014-06-20,"You may need to jumpstart your plans today, but then the momentum builds quickly and you can end up spending much of the day engaging in creative activities. If you have been working overtime chasing your dreams, you deserve the chance to pursue whatever makes you happy. Go for it; break out of your current routine and surrender to the joy of the moment."
aquarius,2014-06-20,"As the day unfolds, you might become less and less comfortable about something that you realize cannot be easily changed. You may feel strongly about what you see as a potential conflict between your values and what you now want to do. Go ahead and explore new avenues of self-expression today, even if they don't fit into your pre-established notions of who you are. Healthy experimentation leads to personal growth."
pisces,2014-06-20,"You're experiencing a whirlwind of activity in your life but your imagination is soaring, enabling you to have an amazing time now without necessarily finding pleasure or peace. Nevertheless, you still must play your part in the current drama. Make a conscious effort to slow down later in the day. Feed your senses with inspirational music that soothes the soul and good food that fuels the body. Spend time in nature or soak in a hot tub; whatever you do, be nice to yourself."
aries,2014-06-21,"You may feel as if reality is taking control of the wheel and gently applying pressure to the brakes now that the Sun has shifted into cautious Cancer. Even if you have ambitious goals in sight, your head is saying one thing but your gut instincts are telling you something else. There's no need to share your internal conflict yet; keep your thoughts to yourself for a while longer. Use these next few weeks to practice listening to your heart."
taurus,2014-06-21,"Normally, you have more than your fair share of common sense, but for the moment you're cruising under the influence of subconscious drives. Fantasies may be growing out of control and you could even convince yourself that they are real today. Your current progress might have you feeling overly optimistic, but the sooner you face the facts, the better. You can reach your destination, but it won't be as easy as it now seems. Fortunately, your determination increases over the weekend, empowering you to overcome nearly any obstacle in your path."
gemini,2014-06-21,"Your energy is operating on full tilt today, just as you like it. The biggest problem is that you may be heading toward a wall, even if you don't see it yet. Unless you begin to slow down in order to get a solid grip on the road, you might be rudely awakened as you deal with the situation ahead. Luckily, demonstrating just a bit of restraint now goes a long way toward avoiding immovable objects and accomplishing your dreams. Keep your eyes wide open and be ready to stop at a moment's notice."
cancer,2014-06-21,"Your current dilemma is one you have encountered many times before. When conflict builds, do you quietly hold your feelings within and go with the external flow? Or, should you bring your needs up to the surface where you face the possibility of rejection? Although balance is key, it's a sensible strategy to ride your emotions through the intensity of a midday crescendo before making any major decisions about what to share. Keep in mind that whatever you choose to disclose today will have a powerful impact on your relationships."
leo,2014-06-21,"Impulsively expressing your feelings today can land you into a bit of emotional hot water. If you tell it like it is, you could easily shock someone you love, triggering an immediate backlash. But if you hold steady to your convictions, the results can ultimately be quite satisfying for everyone involved. Nevertheless, silence is not your friend now; take a risk and walk on the wild side."
virgo,2014-06-21,"When the emotional waters get too deep, you Virgos like to fall back onto your strong analytical prowess to find your way back to solid ground. However, you may have to trust the feelings in the pit of your stomach because you don't have time to run everything through your logic tubes today. You really don't need words now; you only need your intuition and a bit of common sense."
libra,2014-06-21,"Wearing your heart on your sleeve only takes you so far today; you must also be ready for an unexpected conflict to arise. Although you are often the Champion of Nice, there's no reason to waste your energy trying to be diplomatic now. Even if you thrive on making others feel at ease, it's not currently about being gracious. Push past the infatuation stage where you give your power away to others, and then push even further beyond your dreams. It's time to get real and make your move."
scorpio,2014-06-21,"Circumstances might feel uncertain on the romantic front now, and it's up to you to create balance between your craving for immediate pleasure and your need for long-term stability. Thankfully, you can have it both ways, but you must proceed with caution. Go ahead and pursue your heart's desire, but remember that your current actions will have significant consequences. Consider the extremes prior to taking a more moderate course."
sagittarius,2014-06-21,"Unexpected events create more intensity and drama in relationships than you need. But don't let the negative possibilities prevent you from fully engaging with someone you love; the more you try to avoid the issues today, the crazier things become. Beneath the veneer of normalcy, there are profound realizations to be had. Embracing the uncertainty now makes it much easier for you down the road."
capricorn,2014-06-21,"It's crucial to gain a better handle on what you need from other people now -- and to clarify exactly what you may or may not be able to get at this moment. One thing is for sure: your relationships are undergoing a powerful metamorphosis. Don't waste your time struggling to maintain the status quo. Instead of standing in your own way of progress, be willing to explore the possibilities of your new reality."
aquarius,2014-06-21,"Normally, you have enough emotional detachment to focus on the present moment and visualize future opportunities. However, now you're required to reassess your relationship with the past, especially if it uncharacteristically holds on to you with a grip of steel. Don't be afraid to look back into your history in order to process these memories one last time. Even if this sentimental journey takes a few days or longer, it is worth it in the end. Clear the air so you can once again be swept up into the exciting whirlwind of what's to come."
pisces,2014-06-21,"The time to hesitate is through; you must take a stand for what you want. But don't be careless in your actions since your passionate defense could go too far today, provoking a surprising battle for control. Don't play the role of a victim because it won't help you get any closer to happiness. Instead, let others know what you need without compromising your integrity. Summon the courage to speak from your heart."
aries,2014-06-22,"Even if everyone is cheering you on today, you still must rely on your own determination if you want to finish what you start. Your day might begin rather slowly and it could feel like you need to move faster to catch the wave. Perhaps you should just let this one wash over you and not do anything about it at all. Instead of trying to be productive, give yourself a personal holiday and take the day off."
taurus,2014-06-22,"You may be self-conscious about your appearance today. Wearing something that boosts your self-esteem can certainly help you get the day off to a proper start, but remember that it's not just about looking good. Your beauty extends beneath the skin, and connecting with your inner self enables you to fully shine your light. Expressing your heart offers you the best chance to get what you need."
gemini,2014-06-22,"Finish up as much old business as possible today since you may want to start something completely new tomorrow. Obtaining closure on a project or a relationship issue might require that you stick to the work at hand, even if your natural tendency is to move on. Tenacity pays off now if your intentions are honorable. Showing up with integrity and demonstrating your persistence inspires others to join in your cause."
cancer,2014-06-22,"Others stand by you now and even come to your aid if you need it. It's not that you are necessarily in trouble; it's just that you feel more secure knowing that you can rely on your allies to ride to your rescue. If possible, plan a social activity with your family or a small group of friends. Something as simple as going out to brunch with the ones you love can be just the right thing to put a perfect spin on your day."
leo,2014-06-22,"The spotlight is shining on you whether or not you want to be the main attraction today. Your ability to see things through to completion can now hold you in good stead with your peers, for they are relying on your sense of duty and generous nature. You have what it takes as long as you don't lose sight of your purpose. Don't try to garner extra attention by making your role in the events of the day bigger than it is; just give your best performance and take a bow."
virgo,2014-06-22,"Others may fantasize of far-off places as their means of personal escape, but you envision your adventure with a more realistic attitude. This pragmatic perspective actually might allow you to take the trip of your dreams. Since the Moon is in your 9th House of Big Ideas, you can also travel in your mind. Grab every opportunity available to learn something new about a culture or place you wish to visit. Imagination is the breeding ground for reality."
libra,2014-06-22,"A matter of intrigue might be so alluring that you become compulsive about figuring it all out. You have a practical sense about you today, but you still can't quit until you find the missing piece of the puzzle. You are determined to solve the mystery now, but it's wise to check in with reality to make sure you aren't sliding off into the world of illusion and fantasy. Dreams feed your soul as long as you know the difference between when you're dreaming and when you're awake."
scorpio,2014-06-22,"Although you sometimes love the complexity of life, now you are searching for simpler pleasures. There's nothing complicated about spending time with the ones you love or appreciating a satisfying meal, a hot bath and restful sleep. However, if fulfilling your desires were really that straightforward for you, life would be too easy. Nevertheless, the little things can be just enough to make you smile today."
sagittarius,2014-06-22,"Pay attention to health issues, even if you are currently feeling fine. You can make simple improvements to your lifestyle that have subtle, yet long-lasting consequences. If you are thinking about a new exercise program, this is the right time to start. If you want to make changes to your diet, now is better than later. These don't need to be major modifications, for even small positive adjustments have a significant impact on your life over the long run."
capricorn,2014-06-22,"If your thoughts are drifting toward love, it's probably about practical considerations versus emotional issues. Even if you're romantically inclined, your mind is preoccupied with the real world now. Think about how you can be the best partner or lover possible. Do everything that's within your power to make the most of your current connection with someone special. Taking the time to express your true feelings is the first step to cultivating intimacy."
aquarius,2014-06-22,"Your imagination is soaring high above the real world today. Memories of your childhood flood into awareness, bringing with them a sense of nostalgia. You often have a fairly matter-of-fact outlook on your past, but now things are a bit softer and more diffused. Enjoy the flights of fancy, but don't forget to return to your current responsibilities when needed."
pisces,2014-06-22,"You might find yourself with another hectic day on your hands. Your calendar doesn't seem to give you any breathing room and you could feel like a stage magician who is juggling one too many balls. A radical solution is to just postpone one or two appointments today, so everything doesn't come crashing down around you. Paring back extraneous activities early in the day restores the calm and eases your busy mind."
aries,2014-06-23,"Even if you can envision your ideal life, the road from here to there isn't very straightforward now. You're drawn toward multiple possibilities with a variety of wonderful paths branching out from this present moment, and you are ready to eagerly embark on any one of them. Nevertheless, something real or imagined is in your way and you must overcome your current fears about the future before you are given the green light. Slowing down and processing your feelings today helps to lessen the resistance and increases your chances for success."
taurus,2014-06-23,"You may be sad to say goodbye to your key planet Venus as she moves from your sensual sign into airy Gemini. But all is not lost, for the love planet moves into your 2nd House of Self-Worth, boosting your popularity and improving your financial situation. Use your charm to attract people who are naturally fun to be around, rather than those who bring unnecessary drama. Just don't get carried away with your playful manner now because stability in relationships brings you the most satisfaction."
gemini,2014-06-23,"You need to exercise a bit of self-restraint because someone who enters your life might appear too good to be true. Magnetic Venus dances into your flirtatious sign today, offering you the possibility of love and prosperity. Just remember, she doesn't arrive with a guarantee; you must earn whatever you receive. A little common sense goes a long way now to keep you grounded; without it you might quickly discover that you have been fooled by your own illusions. All that glitters is not gold."
cancer,2014-06-23,"It might feel as if a heavy burden is lifting from your shoulders today. The sky is growing bluer and the birds are singing happy songs. However, your sunny attitude may have very little or even nothing to do with external circumstances. A reconnection with your higher self could be all you need to alter the appearance of your outside world. The power of a spiritual orientation can chase away the dark clouds now and add more joy to your world."
leo,2014-06-23,"Although you might not be fully satisfied with your current lot in life, you could be so distracted from the present moment that you don't even notice something's missing. You can move from one fantastic event or fascinating person to the next, without stopping to think about the important things that truly matter. A persuasive person could talk you into nearly anything unless you suddenly come to your senses. Remember, you can't avoid a critical lesson, so wake up and face reality now before it's too late. After all, you're the master of your own fate."
virgo,2014-06-23,"You could be pleased with how a relationship is developing, but you're still reluctant to share your feelings. You don't want to reveal too much because you may be fearful of how others will respond. However, you might be surprised with your sense of relief when you don't have to control all the variables in your environment. Love ebbs and flows with the tides of emotions now, so just let the currents carry you back and forth until they eventually settle down. Surrendering to the universe allows magic to happen."
libra,2014-06-23,"Although you could be tied in knots with unexpressed anger, you may appear quiet and accommodating if you're uncomfortable with a current situation. However, if you feel emotionally safe, you could just as easily ramble on endlessly, sharing whatever thoughts cross your mind. Either way, you might still be withholding something significant. The good news is it's not up to anyone else to decide what you say and when you say it. Trust your instincts and you will know when it's time to tell all."
scorpio,2014-06-23,"At first, everything seems to be in order today; your emotions are giving you signals to go ahead. But the sudden appearance of an obstacle could elicit a fearful reaction that reminds you of a similar experience from your past. However, there's no reason to believe that a repeat occurrence is inevitable. Remain focused on current events and don't let a hurtful memory stand between you and the potential joy of the present moment."
sagittarius,2014-06-23,"You may take on too many tasks today, only to feel frustrated that you didn't finish everything you started. Although your self-judgment can be overly harsh now, others probably only notice what you did, rather than what was left undone. Don't waste energy over analyzing your behavior; instead, enjoy the variety of activities that fill your day. Sometimes the most significant experiences are the transient ones that have no apparent tangible value at all."
capricorn,2014-06-23,"You could be somewhat stressed today because you have so many things to accomplish that you don't even know where to begin. The truth is that it really doesn't matter which item you cross off your list first; you simply need to jump in and do something. In addition, it's less important to gain closure around any one issue than it is to stir up lots of excitement, even if this is normally out of character for you. You can always refocus your energy in a few days after the dust has settled back down."
aquarius,2014-06-23,"Taking your work seriously is nearly impossible when there are so many lovely distractions around you. Intriguing possibilities for fun and games pop up everywhere you look today, even if you don't act on your desires. Nevertheless, those pesky responsibilities aren't going away on their own. The sooner you attend to them the more time you have left over for pleasurable pursuits. Luckily, following your bliss can be its own reward."
pisces,2014-06-23,"You might be tempted to seek approval from others who are equally as passionate about your interests, but today the recognition may come from your closest friends and family. You appreciate the support being offered, but there is still an edginess to your emotions that you don't understand. It's challenging to trust the signs enough to slow down and show your vulnerability. Nevertheless, the most direct way to improve the quality of your life now is to face your fear of rejection rather than running from it. Sharing your feelings is a great place to start."
aries,2014-06-24,"It's not always easy to take someone else's feelings into consideration when making a decision because expressing your independent nature is part of being a pioneering Aries. Your patience may be at an all-time low while electric Uranus opposes warrior Mars in your 7th House of Companions, complicating relationship dynamics even more. Thankfully, you have the option of tempering your approach when telling others what you need. Speak from your heart, listen with compassion, and don't compromise your truth."
taurus,2014-06-24,"A social injustice at work might make you hot under the collar today, but losing your temper won't fix anything. Instead of stirring up more trouble, explain what's bothering you without placing blame on anyone else. Seek answers based upon establishing common ground rather than fanning the flames of discord. Even if helping to mediate the conflict takes extra effort on your part, it will be worth it in the long run. Cultivating harmony earns you more respect than you know."
gemini,2014-06-24,"You are at the top of your verbal game now that the evocative Moon is back in your witty sign. Unfortunately, your humor could pack more of a punch than you realize, especially if you are withholding your feelings because you don't want to upset your friends or coworkers. Nevertheless, you can still shine your light brightly as long as you remember not to take your sarcasm too far. Ultimately, being kind trumps being funny almost every time."
cancer,2014-06-24,"Unexpected changes at work could be destabilizing if you're trying to cling to the safety of the past. However, the status quo isn't as secure as you might think and the more you worry now, the tougher the transition will be. Thankfully, you have the power to influence your future in a positive manner by playing through the various scenarios in your head. Instead of focusing on what you need to let go, think about what you're making room for in the days ahead. Be ready to embrace the opportunity when it knocks on your door."
leo,2014-06-24,"You might think that anything is possible today, inspiring you to be overly optimistic about your plans. Luckily, you're partly right; there's a great deal of potential in your immediate future and it's up to you to figure out how to best manifest your dreams. However, stretching reality too far can create a backlash and leave you wondering how you lost your way. Set your goals high and reach for the stars; just don't lose your footing while your imagination is soaring above the clouds."
virgo,2014-06-24,"Keeping your mind on work is tricky today because there are so many other fascinating ways to fill your time. In fact, you might provoke an argument with an associate just because your current priorities are so different. Even if you're tempted to go to the mat to make your case, it's not wise to force an issue now. Instead of copping an attitude and trying to justify your actions, take the high road and happily follow through on your commitments without creating any drama. Meeting your obligations swiftly frees you to explore your interests later on."
libra,2014-06-24,"You're not so likely to compromise in order to keep the peace today, creating additional stress in your personal life. Communication is complicated by buried tensions that may be starting to surface now. However, it's not a good idea to suppress your feelings, even if they don't meet other people's expectations. You have an opportunity to revitalize a relationship by addressing a difficult topic in a rational manner instead of waiting until the energy grows out of control. There's no need to be afraid of change, especially if it improves the quality of your life."
scorpio,2014-06-24,"You're searching for new and exciting ways to express your creative nature. Fortunately, you don't have to throw the baby out with the bathwater; you can make small yet meaningful changes that revitalize both your work and play. However, suppressed needs will likely work their way out into the open today with or without your permission. You might be surprised if someone loses his or her temper just when you thought you had things under control. Instead of waiting for the lightning to hit, make a preemptive strike and demonstrate your brilliance for all to see."
sagittarius,2014-06-24,"Others look to you to be the life of the party and, fortunately, you're more than willing to fulfill their expectations. You're not eager to slow down and relax today, but overdoing the play can be exhausting. Enjoyment is not an all-or-nothing proposition; you can adjust the magnitude of your experience now. Let the good times roll, but keep your hand on the volume control. Setting a sustainable pace allows your fun to last a lot longer."
capricorn,2014-06-24,"Changes on the home front require your undivided attention today, especially if you recently swept an unresolved problem under the rug. You wish you could sidestep a direct confrontation because you're afraid of what you might say once you open the door to your feelings. However, if you have been quietly putting up with an unsatisfactory situation, this is your chance to finally clear the air. Even if you unearth buried feelings that exacerbate your discomfort, everyone will likely feel better once all the issues are out on the table."
aquarius,2014-06-24,"Although you're innately attracted to the weird and wonderful side of life, things may be getting a bit strange these days even for you. You might feel anxious if those daily routines that you rely on are less than stable now. However, you are being given a chance to improve your day-to-day habits. Instead of trying to maintain the status quo, practice being more flexible than ever. If you're willing to roll with the waves for the sake of change, they can take you on a most amazing ride of transformation."
pisces,2014-06-24,"A sudden change in finances might create extra stress today, whether it's from an unexpected expense or a shift in income. Although you could experience a windfall, it's more likely that the material world is challenging you in some way. Perhaps you should let go of a few possessions you no longer need. Or, maybe, it's time to restructure an old debt. In any event, the tension is a symptom of your evolving relationship with money. Rather than worrying about what may be lost, maximize the positive long-term benefits by remaining open to the current opportunities."
aries,2014-06-25,"Provoking an argument to resolve a difference of opinions isn't a wise move unless you have exhausted all other options. Instead of picking a fight, turn the tables and demonstrate how helpful you can be today. Cooperation is your smartest strategy now; it's certainly better than wasting energy in unnecessary conflict. Trying to prove that you're right won't solve anything; take the high road and use a disagreement as an opportunity to evolve."
taurus,2014-06-25,"You might have to deal with a difficult person today and, luckily, you have the necessary skills to safely protect your boundaries. However, winning a border skirmish isn't enough; you must also behave in a kind and supportive manner. Oddly enough, your apparent nemesis may not be a real adversary now unless you push him or her into the role by escalating a minor conflict into a major crisis. Putting things in a healthy perspective before you defend your position goes a long way toward keeping the peace."
gemini,2014-06-25,"You aren't interested in adhering to social conventions now, but you also don't want to be left out of the action. You may claim you're willing to have a heartfelt discussion with a close friend or loved one, yet you prefer to keep the conversation on the light side as long as possible. Although exploring your feelings might reveal your innate discomfort with emotional vulnerability, it could also bring a deeper sense of intimacy. Take a risk and let others know what you want; it's healthier to face your fears now rather than ignoring them."
cancer,2014-06-25,"A recent misunderstanding over who is in charge raises intense issues today that might provoke extreme feelings. Fortunately, you can tap into an inner clarity that allows you to express your frustration without shifting blame to anyone else. Seeking your personal truth could lead you back to your own emotional center, but even the most amazing revelations won't have much significance unless you find the courage to be vulnerable now. Don't worry too much about the wrong things; sharing your heart with a trusted friend is safer than you think."
leo,2014-06-25,"You are quick to overreact today if a lingering disagreement about plans for an upcoming trip remains unresolved. Focusing on the dynamics now rather than the details can turn the whole situation into a bigger deal than you intend. But suppressing your feelings isn't a useful tactic, either. If you hold back your emotions because you think it's safer to stay quiet, the unexpressed energy acts like a lightning rod. Wait for an appropriate moment to calmly share your concerns and hope that others will do the same."
virgo,2014-06-25,"Telling someone how you feel today is more complicated than you expect, especially if you're worried that your disclosure might be a catalyst that triggers unpleasant memories. Nevertheless, you may not be able to relax until you open up and express what's in your heart. Be careful; revealing your inner process might elicit a backlash of powerful emotions, but the lessons you learn now could make your journey entirely worthwhile."
libra,2014-06-25,"You know that delivering on your promises is critical today or others will judge you rather harshly. You may be obsessed with following through on your commitments, and might work extra hard to fulfill your responsibilities now. Don't let anyone hook you with an emotional drama that isn't your direct concern. If you diligently stay on track, you could accomplish all you set out to do, and with a little luck still have time to relax."
scorpio,2014-06-25,"You may lose control of your schedule today as others place additional requirements on your time. Perhaps you are seeking more independence in your job, but your everyday routine has grown so demanding that you feel stuck with no way out. Trying to force a solution won't bring satisfaction now and might just annoy everyone around you. Stay aware of your feelings, but wait until the intensity settles before you initiate action you can't undo. Count to ten to save yourself from regret."
sagittarius,2014-06-25,"You think you know exactly how to regain control over a complex situation, but you may be feeling uncharacteristically insecure. Don't overcompensate by pretending that everything is sunshine and roses. Although you wish you were having more fun, these aren't necessarily carefree days. Nevertheless, your inner child is itching to come out and play, and might even throw a temper tantrum to have its way. Thankfully, with a bit of conscious effort you should be able to find less disruptive ways to express your creativity."
capricorn,2014-06-25,"It's nearly impossible to prevent you from accomplishing your objectives no matter how tired you are feeling today. There's an inexhaustible supply of energy on reserve now waiting to be tapped, so keep plodding through your tasks, one at a time. Additionally, you are blessed with an extra dose of unwavering determination. Even if you must fight to defend your beliefs, set your goals high and then do whatever it takes to reach them."
aquarius,2014-06-25,"You must be brutally honest with yourself today or you might face a dark night of the soul. But instead of reacting with fear or denial, shine the light of your awareness on your buried concerns. Keep in mind that current events may challenge the usefulness of an agenda that has already served its purpose. Rather than rushing to make a new list of things to do, spend your time now seeking the source of your emotional angst and reprioritizing your goals."
pisces,2014-06-25,"Your defensive shields are up and you may be cruising for an argument today since you are already pushing against the will of others. Unfortunately, you could feel excluded from the group process, even if you are normally an integral part of the team. Although your inclination is to withdraw if you don't think your services are wanted, you can't escape your current responsibilities. If your frustration morphs into anger, you might ruffle some feathers. Nevertheless, it's still wise to give peace a chance."
aries,2014-06-26,"You may be worried that you're running out of time and you still have an important decision to make. Nevertheless, it's probably smarter to wait a day or two before taking any drastic measures. Don't overreact; it's not the best time to rush ahead just to show everyone how well you can handle a crisis at work. Nothing will be gained by trying to inspire others with your courage. Instead of mustering up false bravado, honor your emotions without trying to prove anything."
taurus,2014-06-26,"No matter how much work you have on your plate, others might not realize how busy you actually are. Fortunately, you're not seeking recognition now, so working quietly behind the scenes suits your style. However, it's not that you're purposefully trying to avoid the spotlight either; you just don't want to waste energy playing to a crowd. In any event, there's nothing wrong with graciously accepting acknowledgement for your valuable contribution. A little appreciation will do your heart good."
gemini,2014-06-26,"Your moods fluctuate wildly today; each time you make up your mind something happens and your feelings shift again. However, you could be worried with how others interpret your instability now; nevertheless, you don't have the ability to change their perceptions. Wait to share your opinions until your emotions settle down and your clarity returns. Rather than attempting to fix something that is out of your control, concentrate on remaining true to your core values, instead."
cancer,2014-06-26,"Hiding your feelings today may not be as easy as you think. The evocative Moon's return to your sign this afternoon can fill you with pride or raise fears that you prefer to avoid. In either case, be ready to go on a bumpy ride. Just remember, it's best to manage your moods as they change or they will just get in the way of the next emotional cycle that starts with tomorrow's New Moon. Let go of your old expectations; maintaining an open mind helps you discover a new direction for the month ahead."
leo,2014-06-26,"You have secret permission from the cosmos to keep to yourself today because you could benefit from some quiet time to listen to your heart. It can be challenging to hear your own voice if you're always busy running around for everyone else. It's not your fault if people are pushing you to perform. Instead of feeling like a dancing bear in a circus, do what's best for you now. Others will forgive your current need for privacy when you return with a new and improved attitude."
virgo,2014-06-26,"You could confuse others at work with your scattered energy today and inadvertently distract them from their chores. Although your intentions are good, you're not interested in establishing an agenda for anyone else. But before you claim that you don't want the extra responsibility now, consider the practicalities involved in the trade-off. It may be smarter to negotiate for what you want than to just walk away and miss out on the chance to make a difference."
libra,2014-06-26,"Your natural concern for the well-being of others at work is one of the things that makes you such a valuable team player. However, you might set yourself up for disappointment today if you spread yourself too thin by taking care of everyone else. Try weaving an invisible protective web around you so you don't get pulled off track from your personal goals. Your current feelings of scarcity can dampen your enthusiasm and impede your progress. It may feel like a stretch to change your attitude now, but you certainly have the power to do it. Counting your blessings is a great place to start."
scorpio,2014-06-26,"You realize you must focus on the present moment instead of holding onto an old dream that stands in the way of your happiness. If someone questions your life strategy today, avoid falling into the trap of feeling like you must defend your long-term goals. However, keep in mind that clinging to your past or dreaming about the future doesn't leave you with much time for now. As Einstein wrote, ninety-nine percent of genius is knowing what's important."
sagittarius,2014-06-26,"It seems like everyone wants to spend time with you now because you know how to kick up your heels and have fun while still remaining emotionally available. However, you can avoid the stress of being in such high demand today by redirecting the subject of a conversation away from your feelings and onto the concerns of others. Your cleverness allows you to skip through the day, but be careful that you don't sacrifice the needs of your heart in the process."
capricorn,2014-06-26,"You prefer others to be forthright and to say exactly what's on their minds; otherwise your imagination transforms the unknown into something worse than the simple truth. You aren't very pleased if a friend or partner holds out on you now. Unfortunately, your desire to know another person's feelings could drive your own emotions deeper into hiding. Relax your intense curiosity today; an indirect approach may be the perfect catalyst to trigger a necessary conversation. Too much looking often blinds the eye that seeks but never finds."
aquarius,2014-06-26,"Your desire for an intellectual debate may be thwarted today as other people's feelings keep cycling back into the discussion. You might steer the topics away from subjective biases. But your attempts to modify the natural flow of the conversation could anger someone, eliciting the very same emotional outbreak you wish to avoid. Instead, allow the dialogue to meander on its own without imposing your agenda. The wisdom of the cosmos shines the brightest now when you're not trying to be in control."
pisces,2014-06-26,"If you think a coworker is attempting to take unfair advantage of your kindness, your swift response today could catch him or her off guard. Sometimes you can be forgiving to a fault, but you might overreact now if you feel pushed too far. Don't be afraid of engaging in a power struggle if necessary; just keep in mind that your compassion is still your most effective weapon. Taking the high road earns you the most respect in the end."
aries,2014-06-27,"If a relationship with a friend or family member is energetically stuck, you may want to get off to a new beginning today. Unfortunately, the cautious Cancer New Moon in your 4th House of Emotional Security makes you uncertain about how to best move forward at all. In fact, there's a voice within suggesting that you shouldn't start anything now, for you could create more problems than you intend. Don't let fear stop you from sharing your goals. Even if you must take things slowly, it's time to look ahead and get ready for what's next in your life."
taurus,2014-06-27,"You think you have important things to say, yet after careful consideration you might decide that you are better off listening to others than blabbering away about your own stuff. The nurturing Cancer New Moon falls in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, prompting you to spend much of the day amongst family and friends without feeling the need to go venturing far from home. Even if you must go to work, don't waste time taking on extra activities. Conserving your energy while you can puts you in a better position to pursue your dreams in the days ahead."
gemini,2014-06-27,"Although you crave peace and quiet today, there are some commitments you won't be able to avoid. Nevertheless, the Cancer New Moon occurs in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, reminding you to create some time to be alone now, no matter what it takes. However, being by yourself is not the same as being lonely; it's about reconnecting with your inner self, which often gets crowded out by all the noise and activity you manifest in your life. Taking a few steps back is like hitting the reset button and giving yourself a fresh start."
cancer,2014-06-27,"You can't ignore your needs today, even if you choose not to share what you want with anyone else. The New Moon in your self-protective sign encourages you to pull your energy in and keep your feelings all to yourself. Unfortunately, satisfaction will remain elusive unless you take a chance and talk about your desires. Knowing when to push past your fear of rejection is a sign of intelligence. Pick someone you can trust and open your heart a little at a time."
leo,2014-06-27,"You have a lot of hidden feelings brewing beneath the surface today. You are often quite upfront, telling it like it is. However the introspective Cancer New Moon intensifies your 12th House of Secrecy, making you less likely now to share what's in your heart. Nevertheless, you still must honor what is happening within. It's not necessary to act on every emotion, but don't push them away either, even if they complicate your life for a while. The only way out is to go within."
virgo,2014-06-27,"Getting together with your friends to share your dreams sounds like a sweet idea now, but previous commitments may hold you back even though you don't want to say no. Perhaps the Cancer New Moon's presence in your 11th House of Community means there's just too many activities today and something has to give. Thankfully, you don't have to discuss all the complications of your schedule with anyone else. Wait and see how the day develops and participate only if you have time. A little less structure and a bit more flexibility will do you good."
libra,2014-06-27,"You secretly would love to crawl into the security of your own private world today and luxuriate in the notion that you don't have to go anywhere or see anyone. However, reality may not let you off the hook without a good fight. You might be called on to take responsibility for others now that the Cancer New Moon washes into your 10th House of Career, and you begrudgingly rise to the occasion. Oddly enough, if you play your cards right you can assume a leadership role while still feeling safe within your own shell."
scorpio,2014-06-27,"Your emotions draw you into uncharted realms as the watery Cancer New Moon floods your 9th House of Big Ideas, whether or not you are ready for the next adventure.

Perhaps you are being sucked into an emotional drama now that the Cancer New Moon influences your 8th House of Intimacy. Nevertheless, there's not an easy way to circumvent the tension. Sure, there's always the next flight to Antarctica, but what would you do once you got there? Forget your ideas about the Great Escape. Sink into your feelings with the assurance that your positive attitude will return and you'll be back to your buoyant self soon enough."
capricorn,2014-06-27,"You are experiencing a personal high tide of emotions that pull at your most fundamental relationships now that the sensitive Cancer New Moon lands in your 7th House of Others. You Mountains Goats are quite comfortable when striving for stability, but you don't feel as sure-footed when the waters rise. Keep in mind that it's perfectly safe to let your feet leave the ground. Swim through the swirl of feelings without clinging to any one desire along the way. Adaptability is now your key to happiness."
aquarius,2014-06-27,"You can sense the energetic shift as the Cancer New Moon in your 6th House of Daily Routine distracts you from your high-flying thoughts and drops you into a pool of messy details. No matter how hard you try to separate out the different strands of emotions, they are tightly interwoven to create a complex tapestry. You may feel as if this emotional fabric is too heavy for use, but it lightens up dramatically when you wear it as if it were your own."
pisces,2014-06-27,"A fresh start with respect to love can be highly energizing, but this is not a ticket to leave a current relationship that may be going through a stressful period. Instead, today's nurturing Cancer New Moon activates your 5th House of Spontaneity, infusing your new feelings into an existing partnership to foster a deeper intimacy. However, if you aren't romantically involved, take this opportunity to pursue creative interests, instead. No matter where you channel your passion, it's crucial to move tentatively for the longest-lasting results."
aries,2014-06-28,"Although you have plenty of errands to run, you still may feel like staying home and hiding out today. The self-protective Cancer Moon asks you to soften your aggressive stance and show more sensitivity to those around you.

Thankfully, there's no need to act like a superhero; it's really okay to be human after all."
taurus,2014-06-28,"Hanging out with friends and family sounds like such a good idea today that you might want to invite even more people to join in the fun. You may think socializing with others can help you stabilize your own shifting feelings. This tactic could work as long as you don't get distracted by endless gossip and meaningless chatter. Remember to pay attention to your emotions, even if they are making you anxious. Your heart is trying to send you a message; being with those you love allows you to be your authentic self."
gemini,2014-06-28,"You might not be able to shake off your nervous energy today and your lack of self-control is quite bothersome. You want to make your point, but wonder if you can stand up for your beliefs in the face of opposition. Although your inner voice is telling you to let it go, think again before going silent.

What you don't say today, you could regret tomorrow."
cancer,2014-06-28,"Your feelings tend to run quite a bit deeper than others might realize. Nevertheless, you're at home in your own depths, even if you're having difficulty communicating your emotions to anyone else. Don't worry about other people's expectations. Start slowly and share something easy; then work up to more challenging material later in the day. Be gentle with yourself; getting the ball rolling is enough for now."
leo,2014-06-28,"Be careful about pushing your beliefs on others today or you may end up provoking an unnecessary argument. However, if you choose to keep your desires to yourself, it certainly doesn't mean you are lacking in emotions.

A little self-reflection will do you a world of good."
virgo,2014-06-28,"You could feel a bit detached from everyone else today, as if your emotional connections are not very strong. At first, maybe you thought that your intentions were understood, yet you suddenly retreat when you realize that your message was misinterpreted. Keep in mind that it's common for misunderstandings to occur when you talk about ideas that are beyond the description of language. Don't take things too personally; your key planet Mercury is playing the role of the trickster now, and it's best to laugh your way through it. Your sense of humor is your secret weapon."
libra,2014-06-28,"Your feelings are unusually intense today, yet you may choose not to say a word about your internal drama. You might want to show someone special that you care, but prefer to express it through actions instead of words. However, this doesn't mean you can't keep all channels of communication wide open. Just continue to follow your heart, even if it seems awkward at first. Let your passion fuel your momentum to create a memorable moment."
scorpio,2014-06-28,"You're in a contemplative mood today as you reflect on your current conditions and re-evaluate your future plans. However, the watery Cancer Moon can overload you with whirlpools of powerful emotions, intensified now by your key planet Mars. Nevertheless, even if you try to be practical, your heart isn't listening to your logic. Don't try to force your feelings into a box; just let them play out on their own accord and allow the cards to fall where they may."
sagittarius,2014-06-28,"You Archers aren't typically interested in directing your aim at the inner worlds of emotions. Your intent may be fiery, but your bowstring is currently heavy with the worries of the Cancer Moon. Although you like to point your arrows toward lofty ideas and engage in philosophical debate, you won't be able to think your way out of this one. Give up the struggle; for once, your feelings just need to be felt."
capricorn,2014-06-28,"Your current circumstances grow more complex as the day progresses. You could be lured into a heated interaction with a friend or family member whose feelings are at odds with yours. This irresolvable difference of opinions is frustrating, for the most sensible solution seems so clear to you. Why can't others set aside their emotional baggage so you can move on with your day? This dilemma might not have an immediate solution. Thankfully, you have another option: you can simply smile and walk away."
aquarius,2014-06-28,You could be feeling so uncharacteristically moody today that your irrational emotions blur the clarity of your perceptions. But fate lurks in the shadows and might spring upon an unsuspecting moment to suddenly transform everything. Don't sweat what you can't change; this cosmic surprise can work to your advantage if you roll with the waves and stop thinking that you need to be in control. Set logic aside and let your imagination soar.
pisces,2014-06-28,"Your emotional desires are strong today, motivating you to engage in playful romance in order to get what you want. You often realize that rational thinking doesn't make sense out of everything, but it's particularly challenging now to leap into the unknown. Nevertheless, you cannot talk your way to satisfaction. You just have to trust the universe and jump in with your heart wide open. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
aries,2014-06-29,"It appears you're eager to take a risk to get what you want, but behind your optimistic veneer you might have more self-doubt today than anyone realizes. Luckily, once you finally climb out on a limb, you suddenly realize that things will be okay. Build your strategy on proven facts alone and not faulty assumptions based on unrealistic dreams. Having a pragmatic plan in place can make the difference between failure and success."
taurus,2014-06-29,"Don't initiate action too quickly today because the truth is elusive and by tomorrow you might want to base your plan on an entirely different set of parameters. The Moon's visit to your 4th House of Home and Family reminds you of all your unfinished domestic chores. Nevertheless, your key planet Venus titillates you with romantic visions now, tempting you to drop everything for the possibility of finding love or fortune. However, your integrity is at stake so it's prudent to set aside transient fantasies; real satisfaction requires patience and persistence."
gemini,2014-06-29,"You may be anxious today because there are so many things you want to do, yet you have trouble prioritizing your projects. Usually, you're quite comfortable dividing your time over several tasks at once but now, the closer you get to making up your mind the more uncertain you become. Thankfully, your confusion should dissipate once you choose to postpone a big decision. Waiting until the fog lifts enables you to see your options in a clear light."
cancer,2014-06-29,"Your imagination is hyperactive today, but even those closest to you might not realize how much is going on behind your calm demeanor. Unfortunately, your current lack of clarity can land you in a heap of trouble if you jump to an incorrect conclusion. Don't rely on your logic alone since you're able to bend reality in your favor now. Ask someone you trust to give you their honest perspective. Although a reality check may not change your mind, it's still helpful to get a second opinion for safety's sake."
leo,2014-06-29,"There's nothing wrong with your decision-making skills today, yet you could still upset the apple cart if you act on an impulse instead of taking a more rational approach. Your fascination with someone special or an intriguing idea may have you wandering around in circles. However, exercising some self-restraint is wise while you consider the consequences of immediately pursuing your desires. If your plan makes sense, waiting a little while longer won't reduce your chances to find satisfaction."
virgo,2014-06-29,"You do your best work when you filter out extraneous data before making any important decisions. But the Moon's shift into your 12th House of Destiny prompts you to take things even more seriously; you want to thoroughly understand both sides of a current issue before heading off in the wrong direction. You're more inclined to spend additional time to distinguish fact from fiction once you accept that fantasies can now appear real. However, exploring your imagination also offers benefits as long as you remember when to return to earth."
libra,2014-06-29,"Your need for pleasure leads you into a complicated set of circumstances today without an exit strategy in place. You are fascinated by the possibilities when your key planet Venus squares magical Neptune, but things may turn out very different than you expect. You don't have enough reasons to avoid the complexity because the delicious potential is so sweet. Unfortunately, you could find yourself in deeper emotional waters than you planned. Every now and then, sinking into your feelings is good for your soul."
scorpio,2014-06-29,"You are inspired by the notion of putting on a show today as the dramatic Leo Moon moves through your 10th House of Public Status. However, it's nearly impossible to prevent your mind from wandering with two planets dancing in whimsical Gemini.

Fortunately, you can enjoy the present moment more thoroughly if you understand how it contributes to the ultimate satisfaction of reaching your goals."
sagittarius,2014-06-29,"Follow through with your promises today because others are counting on your performance. You want to take your job seriously, yet it's all too easy to misinterpret what is expected from you if you mix up the details. Write your instructions down and then double-check that you heard them correctly. This extra step might seem like overcompensation to someone else, but your meticulous approach now saves you from wasting valuable time and energy. Getting it right the first time makes you the hero of the day."
capricorn,2014-06-29,"Even if you're on a creative streak, it's still a challenge to find an outlet for your best ideas. Unfortunately, your actions might not have the results you want, leaving you feeling discouraged about your dreams. But it's not wise to give up now since your clouds of illusion will start to dissipate later in the day, offering you a clearer vision of the future. Happily, as long as you focus on your goals, your unwavering determination and hard work will eventually pay off."
aquarius,2014-06-29,"You may reconsider recent relationship choices today, especially if you suddenly discover an option that is potentially more enjoyable. However, you could make a foolish decision because you're viewing the future through Neptune's rose-colored glasses now. Although you might be sure about your desire to change direction, it's wiser to let the energy settle down overnight. Don't fall into the trap of chasing bright lights and shiny objects. You can always take a more radical approach to life once you see things in the light of a new day."
pisces,2014-06-29,"You might build your expectations for the day around unrealistic fantasies as sweet Venus aligns with your key planet idealistic Neptune. Oddly enough, sharing relatively insignificant chores with a close friend or significant other could be all it takes to rekindle relationship magic today. Although you can be very obstinate in your unwillingness to compromise now, you don't want to be alone. Choosing your battles carefully minimizes your need to sacrifice what is ultimately most important to you."
aries,2014-06-30,"You're feeling lucky today and are capable of turning almost any situation into a good time. Paradoxically, you don't even have to do anything special; just showing up seems to make everyone smile. The biggest danger can come from being overconfident now since your positive attitude can't cure everything. Thankfully, acknowledging your limitations and focusing on the things you can change inspires others to do the same."
taurus,2014-06-30,"You might prefer to live a simple life these days, yet you really don't want to give up on your long-term goals. Unfortunately, you could tire yourself out attempting to determine the best path to follow. You don't enjoy being pulled simultaneously in different directions because it makes it tough to go along with the flow. Stand back from the pressure of the current circumstances so you can reconnect with your own voice before committing to any one choice."
gemini,2014-06-30,"You're feeling an uneasy tension between your anticipation of what's next and your desire to hold onto the past. You may be moving faster today, but still can't keep up with all the changes in your life. Nonetheless, you might be okay with the uncertainty even if you're a bit overwhelmed. Retreating from the chaos is the smartest thing you can do now. You'll be more effective in the long run if you hang tight for a few days before pushing your agenda ahead again. The waiting is the hardest part."
cancer,2014-06-30,"You may experience the proverbial calm before the storm today, yet your fear of the unknown might feel more ominous than anything that's happening in the present moment. This weekend could mark a turning point, and your recent efforts finally start to bear fruit. Be practical and prepare for the next round of change that is on the horizon. Instead of letting worry discourage you, cultivate a positive attitude by starting from a place of love."
leo,2014-06-30,"Your life grows more complicated now that you can see the whole truth, especially if someone is trying to hide it from you. Your overactive intuition makes it nearly impossible to currently engage in any form of superficial interactions. You're not interested in what others think of your ideas today; your truths aren't up for negotiation. But there's no need to act self-righteously since it's easier to gain support from your friends if you acknowledge that there are several viable ways to look at the same situation. Pride goes before a fall."
virgo,2014-06-30,"Acting with brilliance may be a lot simpler than you think today. Even if you're under pressure to perform, there's no need to jump through any hoops just to demonstrate your reliability. All you're required to do now is to show up with your common sense intact. Let your intelligence shine through, but don't try to solve every little problem that pops up. Do what you do best; set priorities and get busy crossing things off your list."
libra,2014-06-30,"You might not have reached your destination yet, but you are, nonetheless, at the end of a road. Your current position is challenging because your sense of falling short may leave you feeling frustrated today. Thankfully, you can ease the tension now by simply changing your perspective. The emotional landscape has already started to shift; there will be plenty of time to reach your goals once the path in front of you clears again."
scorpio,2014-06-30,"You could run out of patience today when you encounter nearly anything that isn't already on your radar. You are easily distracted if something alluring catches your eye. However, you may grow annoyed with yourself if you succumb to following your whim instead of your schedule. Paradoxically, you still might wonder what you missed if you keep yourself on track. In the long run, it's more important to explore new territory than wasting time worrying about which route to choose."
sagittarius,2014-06-30,"Although you truly believe you have an inexhaustible supply of energy, it's not smart to take on more than you can manage. Your enthusiasm, even when supported by unrelenting determination, doesn't mean you're invincible. Unfortunately, seeking guidance from others won't likely produce the clarity you seek now; you must make decisions about what you can and can't do on your own. If you overextend yourself today, you'll likely run into trouble next week. Save your strength for when you will need it most."
capricorn,2014-06-30,"You may be expected to manage a complex issue today that involves a financial transaction. Or you might just be feeling pressure from the lack of clarity in a business relationship. Either way, resolution could be delayed because you need more information. Nevertheless, you are still tempted to make an impulsive choice before your time runs out. Don't give in to the expectations of others; wait until later in the week when you have more data at your disposal. Ultimately, you're the one who must live with your decision."
aquarius,2014-06-30,"A friend might express his or her feelings in a manner that catches you completely off guard today, complicating your relationship dynamics. You prefer to keep everything casual and on a rational basis because the energy is simpler to handle. But you can't go back to the way things once were unless you choose a path of denial. Unfortunately, avoiding issues only makes them more difficult to manage. You can try downplaying the drama, but actively engaging in a constructive dialogue is the only way to reduce the complexity."
pisces,2014-06-30,"Distinguishing the separate threads of truth is challenging now, for the thoughts have already been woven with a believable blend of fact and fiction. This complex tapestry entangles your imagination if you overanalyze the situation. Be careful, for your current false sense of certainty allows you to make a decision based on an incorrect assumption. Instead of forcing the issue today, just appreciate each moment as it occurs. It should be easier to sort everything out in a few days."
aries,2014-07-01,"You were caught in a crossfire of conflicting interests last month as Mercury retrograded in your 3rd House of Communication, home territory for the messenger planet. Your life has been very busy and you are still fighting against a mental undertow. As the tide begins to change, you can start to see all kinds of enterprising possibilities roll out before your eyes. Don't wait any longer; launch your ship of ideas into the seas of commerce. Your next journey starts now."
taurus,2014-07-01,"You have been intensely focused on business matters, but progress might be slower than you prefer. Fortunately, if you did your homework, things begin to fall into place now. The work you have done behind the scenes finally has a chance to pay off. Although significant changes may not happen overnight, you can still feel the potential blowing in the wind. The sky is the limit; spread your wings and get ready to fly."
gemini,2014-07-01,"You want to travel -- either in the outer world or within your imagination -- but a weird string of circumstances has come between you and your desires. However, you need mental stimulation more than anything else now. You have reached a saturation point in your current process and must find new ways to revitalize your thinking if you're to make progress toward manifesting your dreams. Pack your bags and hang on to your hat; the universe may be about to grant you your wish."
cancer,2014-07-01,"No matter what is already on your schedule today, you're tempted to just stay home and bury your head in the sand. You're in a contemplative mood and are hesitant to share your thoughts. Your retreat period could last longer than you expect yet the additional time gives you another chance to overcome your fears and gain new spiritual awareness. Don't worry about being isolated since it's only a temporary situation. Trust your instincts; you'll know when it's time to put your ideas, however unformed, out into the open for everyone to see."
leo,2014-07-01,"Social demands during the past few weeks have required more of your time than you prefer. However, your attitude begins to change now that interactive Mercury turns direct in your 11th House of Community. Although working within an organization or group might still feel restrictive, you're more willing to engage in a collective effort. Don't give in to the temptation to strike out on your own; you have a wonderful opportunity to learn a lot about yourself today if you're willing to collaborate with others."
virgo,2014-07-01,"Although career decisions continue to be in the foreground, you might have seen your share of roadblocks while your key planet Mercury retrograded back into your 10th House of Profession. Now you are standing at an important crossroad, although it may feel more like a deja vu. Stop and review the events of last month one more time before choosing your next direction. Make new and improved plans based upon your current analysis of the big picture rather than fixating on any one single moment in time."
libra,2014-07-01,"The lure of adventure has been on your mind, but thankfully, there is more than one way to travel to new lands. Learning expands your mind in a way that is similar to taking a trip. Conveniently, you don't even have to leave the comforts of home to make the most of this cosmic energy. You may have felt like circumstances prevented you from satisfying your current wanderlust, but this is your time to embark on a new journey into uncharted metaphysical realms. Embrace the mystery with an eager spirit and an open mind."
scorpio,2014-07-01,"You may spend lots of time these days thinking about subjects that are not normal concerns for most people. You're naturally quite comfortable delving into the mysteries of sex, death and the meaning of life. However, recently you haven't known what to do with your thoughts because they don't seem to fit in with the current topics of conversation. Test the waters by sharing some of your less controversial ideas with someone you trust. But don't go too far out on a limb; start slowly at first and build momentum. It's more fun if others willingly come along for the ride."
sagittarius,2014-07-01,"Conversations within your individual relationships may have been turned inside out during the past month, creating misunderstandings and leading to confusion. It is now time to revisit these unresolved issues and sort out the truth once and for all. Surprisingly, talks that were previously impossible can now happen without further complications. Remember, it's not only about sharing your point of view; it's also about actively listening to the feedback you receive from others. Healthy communication is a two-way street."
capricorn,2014-07-01,"Paying attention to the details of your everyday routine has grown increasingly difficult while trickster Mercury retrograded through your 6th House of Health and Work. In fact, you may have faced one too many complications when trying to maintain consistency in your daily habits. Instead of wasting time analyzing the past, focus on the specific issues at hand and start to set things right. Demonstrate the power of now by making a decision that can improve your life."
aquarius,2014-07-01,"You might feel as if your self-expression has been blocked during the past few weeks, but the tables are about to be turned. Don't worry too much about your recent lack of progress; instead, restart your creative engines and visualize the alternatives ahead. If romance is on your mind, don't hesitate to share what's in your heart. Let love overcome any lingering fears of rejection; you'll never know what might happen unless you're willing to take a chance."
pisces,2014-07-01,"You may have recently gone on a sentimental journey back through your childhood. Mercury's retrograde into your 4th House of Roots might have even inspired you to revisit your family home or place of birth. Fortunately, you can learn much about your current life by re-evaluating your relationship with your family of origin. But dwelling in the past offers diminishing returns; bring your new perspective back to the present moment where it can positively impact your life."
aries,2014-07-02,"Your anxiety level rises today if you can't figure out a way to complete everything that you promised. Naturally, it's not a good idea to blame anyone else for things that are ultimately your responsibility. Fortunately, you are able to approach your dilemma in a mature manner now, gently sharing your current concerns with those involved instead of dwelling on the mistakes of the past. Focusing on what needs to be done in the present moment elicits cooperation instead of conflict."
taurus,2014-07-02,"The idea of revealing what's actually on your mind might be enough to increase your insecurity today, because you may be afraid that the reaction you'll receive won't be in your favor. However, if you only share some of your emotions, you could set up a situation where you inadvertently alienate a close friend or lover. Your attempt to withhold parts of your story is more transparent than you realize. It is better to simply get everything off your chest now and then deal with whatever fallout occurs. Honesty is the best policy."
gemini,2014-07-02,"You're not thrilled about needing to withhold your desires as the cautious Virgo Moon squares sensual Venus in your sign today. Unfortunately, emotional suppression only makes matters worse; it's healthier to acknowledge potential problems before they manifest. And, if your current plans aren't adequate enough to do the job, work on improving them now -- and not after the fact. There's no time like the present to create the positive change you want to see in your world."
cancer,2014-07-02,"You have an exciting opportunity to get a glimpse of your future -- but you may need to let go of an immediate goal before you can move forward. However, shifting your course shouldn't be considered a failure now since your current trajectory might not be the best way to reach your destination, even if it seems like a direct route. Forget about your preconceived conclusions and draw a new map that's based on today's incoming data instead of yesterday's news. You are the captain of your own destiny."
leo,2014-07-02,"Your work week might not be going exactly as planned, but everything could turn out fine as long as you don't try to control too many of the variables. Paradoxically, the more you resist change now, the harder it is for you to adapt. Set your short-term goals aside for a few days and dream about the distant future while you respond to the current circumstances the best you can. Thankfully, you don't have to sacrifice any important values or slip into denial just to avoid getting lost in self-doubt."
virgo,2014-07-02,"Although you can put your best foot forward now by acting more confidently than you feel, you realize that your workmates expect even more out of you. The reflective Moon's visit to your perfectionist sign raises worries as you try to balance your feelings with your current objectives at work. Don't be afraid to acknowledge your limitations. Your honesty is refreshing to others and motivates them to support your cause. Expressing your vulnerability cultivates an atmosphere of mutual respect."
libra,2014-07-02,"Your role at work is slowly but profoundly transforming as others begin to acknowledge your authority. You might have had to struggle recently to get your opinion heard, but now your astute perspective is in high demand. However, micromanaging your world may temporarily bring your success to a halt. Keep in mind that it's not important to be on top as long as you have your hand in co-creating the changes that are unfolding. Sharing the power allows you to share the success."
scorpio,2014-07-02,"Relationships aren't as complicated as they appear, even if your feelings are more intense than others can handle today. You are willing to work on your communication style, but you want to be noticed for your good intentions and extra effort. Unfortunately, painful memories may cloud your mind, making it harder to hear the positive feedback you receive. Don''t let old emotional tapes drown out any praise that comes your way now. Turning down your volume just a notch creates a more harmonious tone to your interpersonal dynamics."
sagittarius,2014-07-02,"Separating fact from fiction may be a tricky endeavor if someone says one thing but means something else. Nevertheless, you're willing to roll with the incoming waves for the sake of convenience. Although your new goals may not be fully grounded in reality now, they can still inspire you to break through old limitations. However, it might seem as if your current work duties are delaying your long-term success. Don't make any significant changes just yet; fulfilling your immediate responsibilities helps your progress more than you realize."
capricorn,2014-07-02,"You are at a fork in the road and your professional objectives could prompt a minor crisis today, requiring you to choose which route to take. Fortunately, you're not restrained by someone else's arbitrary rules, allowing you to find solutions where others have already failed. Ironically, accepting new responsibilities now might stand between you and success. Ultimately, your ability to remain detached from the outcome is what gives you the winning strategy."
aquarius,2014-07-02,"You might openly disagree with someone at work today, assuming that a heated argument is needed in order to shift the energy. However, conflict won't likely bring you any closer to the truth, and it could even add to the existing animosity. You can be highly productive now as long as you aren't distracted by a petty disagreement. Instead of letting yourself get hooked by your emotions, rise above any differences of opinion and commit to working for the highest cause."
pisces,2014-07-02,"You may appear lost in dreamland today as the shimmering Moon opposes surreal Neptune in your intuitive sign. Surprisingly, you're more pragmatic now than others realize since the exacting Virgo Moon sharpens your senses. Don't get sidetracked by what anyone else might be thinking; they will soon recognize the usefulness of your ideas as your plans take shape over the days ahead. In the meantime, let your imagination be your guide."
aries,2014-07-03,"You're energetically charged and may feel as if you have your act together today. However, you could face tough opposition as if someone is trying to stop your plan from ever seeing the light of day. Nevertheless, don't waste your precious resources by engaging in an unnecessary battle. Instead, plan carefully and save yourself for the main event."
taurus,2014-07-03,"You are eager to take advantage of an opportunity at work because you can see the potential in this moment. However, you might overlook an important piece of the puzzle in your exuberance. The plot thickens throughout the day and you could end up in a power struggle with your ideas going up against someone who is holding all the cards. You may be tempted to give up once the odds are not in your favor. Nevertheless, things are not as they appear. Change is imminent and compromise is inevitable; you still may get what you want."
gemini,2014-07-03,"Your intentions are clear; you prefer to avoid an unpleasant meltdown that might occur if you expressed your hidden feelings. You are often adept at sidestepping sticky issues, but it appears that you must face them head on now. Don't waste too much energy resisting; even direct engagement isn't your first choice, an intense interaction today can release stuck energy that otherwise would have remained in your way. Show your courage and don't back down."
cancer,2014-07-03,"You might be the impulsive one in your group today, but you won't make any friends by just going off on some tangent. You're better off taking several deep breaths and thinking about the source of your current sense of urgency. You may encounter strong resistance to your ideas, so don't fret if you can't change anyone's mind right away. Rely on the strength of the Crab and use your pincers to hold on to your current position. Be patient; the opposition will tire."
leo,2014-07-03,"Others may be giving their best performances today just to get you to change your mind. However, you will likely remain unconvinced. You're fairly certain you know what's best and there is little anyone can do to make you reconsider your position. Even if their argument involves facts, you might require a few days for new facts to impact your thinking. Just remember that your rigidity can backfire on you. If you soften your stance, you'll still get much of what you want."
virgo,2014-07-03,"You are in a long-term process of having one shell after another peeled off you, like the layers of an onion. Now, another veil is being lifted and you are nearer to the ever-elusive truth. Resist the temptation to think that you are close enough to grab it at any cost. The more desperate you are to reach your goals now, the farther you appear to be from your final destination."
libra,2014-07-03,"Your ideas have great impact on others at work today, but your influence doesn't come without paying a price. You're quite impassioned about your beliefs and are willing to do battle to defend them. You can be quite convincing now, but not if your colleagues think you're trying to beat them down with your persistence, rather than just relying on the substance of your ideas. Put your thoughts out there; the best ones will be embraced."
scorpio,2014-07-03,"Your beliefs and values continue to undergo dramatic evolutions in a slow-moving and long-term process. Today, someone may come along with an intellectual flashlight to illuminate these changes for you. It can be difficult, but highly empowering, to actually realize how much you've transformed. You may feel somewhat nostalgic, but mostly you are resigned to completing the transition in order to maximize your chances of finding happiness."
sagittarius,2014-07-03,"Typically, you Archers are exceptionally good at comprehending the big picture. You tend to see your life projected onto a wide screen. However, you need to put blinders on today so you can narrow your focus and pay your respects to the details. You may want to rebel because concentrating isn't as much fun as opening up. Nevertheless, it's just what the doctor has prescribed."
capricorn,2014-07-03,"If you recently built a strong foundation at work, you may be ready to make substantial changes and take things to the next level. If you have been slowly getting more worked up over a dysfunctional situation, a little crisis might come to a head now. You are fed up with the irresolvable tension and are tempted to take drastic action to relieve the situation. Nevertheless, it's wise to move forward cautiously so you don't inadvertently stir up a hornet's nest."
aquarius,2014-07-03,"You are energetically bumping into people today and there seems to be no easy way out of the conflict. But is this a problem between you and them, or is it really an internal struggle between two parts of yourself? If this is an inner dynamic, you'd better think twice before pushing the situation to red alert. Compromise will work, but only if you are aware of your own inconsistency."
pisces,2014-07-03,"You have grown weary of all the talk; it's time for concrete action. However, the difficulty is that you may be hesitant to fully feeling your own power. Don't hold back, only to explode onto the scene with your newly found direction. Instead, move steadily with determination and conviction. If you are willing to lose a few battles along the way, you greatly increase your chances of winning the war."
aries,2014-07-04,"You won't likely hesitate to state your position today, even if it means your popularity might sink. In fact, you gain a strange sort of pleasure now when you stand alone. It's not that you're interested in fighting a losing battle; it's just that you are attracted to the adrenaline rush you get from feeling independent. Thankfully, you can enjoy the thrill of being alive without starting a war of words. Find a worthy opponent and then surprise everyone by establishing common ground."
taurus,2014-07-04,"Your words don't convey exactly what you're feeling today, even if you think everyone is receiving your message as intended. Oddly enough, your positive attitude could prevent you from seeing things in their true light. Facing reality may temporarily upset your sense of well-being, but discovering the truth is ultimately better than fearing the unknown. You might be unexpectedly pleased with what you learn especially as your self-esteem grows in the process."
gemini,2014-07-04,"You naively believe everything will improve if you just say what's on your mind today. But Mercury's smooth trine to the Moon's karmic North Node can't guarantee a positive outcome since you're not in control of other people's reactions. A confrontation won't solve anything now, so wait until the energy settles down before striving for resolution. Instead of trying to prove your point of view is the right one, simply acknowledge the different perspectives and move on."
cancer,2014-07-04,"You're inclined to put your new plan into motion now, but your ideas may be at odds with nearly everyone else's. Nevertheless, you believe your opportunity will be lost if you don't initiate action right away. You might talk yourself into withdrawing into the security of your shell because feeling vulnerable makes you nervous. Trust your intuition; protect what is yours without letting irrational fears influence your choice. Nothing ventured; nothing gained."
leo,2014-07-04,"A close examination of your feelings might reveal suppressed anger, although you may do your best to avoid focusing on negativity today. Even your dearest friends might not be aware of your emotional turmoil since you could easily disguise your inner process by putting on a happy face. However, unresolved tensions resurface if someone tries to manipulate you. Express your hurt or disappointment with kindness to avoid any lingering conflict. Being more transparent with your thoughts helps to clear the air."
virgo,2014-07-04,"You may be driven toward getting your own way now, yet it might be a challenge to stand up to a powerful person who has a different idea in mind for you. Your vehement response when defending your position could surprise even you, especially if you try to stick to your plan at any cost. Unexpected twists and turns require you to set aside your previous agenda so you can fully concentrate on the road ahead of you. Remember, flexibility is your secret weapon in today's encounter with change."
libra,2014-07-04,"Distinguishing between what is public and what is private in your life could be tricky today. You may be very passionate about a new idea, yet still shy away from any potential conflict. If you still end up in an argument, avoid making statements about your own personal beliefs or habits that are better kept to yourself. Too much information might escalate a civil discussion into a debate you can never win. It is better now to err on the side of discretion; politely make your point and then retreat to let everyone else come to their senses."
scorpio,2014-07-04,"Irrational passions are aroused as the Sun opposes your key planet Pluto today. You might work yourself into an agitated state if something goes wrong, but expressing your extreme feelings is not a simple matter now. Unfortunately, denial won't solve your problems, either. The way out of this delicate situation is simply to accept the fact that multiple points of view can exist simultaneously. Happily, yours is not the only solution, even if that's how it seems at first."
sagittarius,2014-07-04,"You might precipitate an emotional meltdown if you try to play the role of a wise philosopher today. Assuming a spiritual position could just be another clever attempt to circumvent your feelings. Paradoxically, you will feel much better if you can get out of your head now long enough to express what's in your heart. Those around you will breathe a sigh of relief too, especially if they're tired of you pretending like everything is okay. Allowing others to see your weak spot isn't as scary as you think."
capricorn,2014-07-04,"Once a topic is brought out into the light, everything may appear as if it's beyond your control. Ultimately, you want to have the final say in each and every matter, even if it seems like you're asking for too much today. However, you could be pleasantly surprised by what happens if you have enough faith to loosen your grip on the steering wheel. Letting someone else run the show increases your power in the long run while also enabling you to make tangible progress toward your goals."
aquarius,2014-07-04,"You could dream up an entirely new way to say the same old thing today, but this isn't just some kind of parlor trick. Inspiration can strike at any moment so make a special effort to communicate now, especially if you have been trying to convey an important message to someone you admire. Even if you aren't getting through at first, your charming persistence ultimately pays off. Your originality is impossible to resist."
pisces,2014-07-04,"Step back and take a fresh look at where you find pleasure in your life. Even if you don't have much time for relaxation today, schedule a few enjoyable activities over the weekend. Do whatever you can to meet your obligations but don't let anyone place a guilt trip on you. No one will have a valid reason to obstruct your progress if you continue to act with integrity. Although you have plenty of work in front of you, squeezing in some fun cultivates a healthy and happy balance in your life."
aries,2014-07-05,"You are driven to talk about what you want because you recognize your goals may not be the same as others. You might feel as if you are getting the short end of the stick, but nevertheless it's best to downplay your personal desires. Although you Rams are often concerned with issues of self-determination, today's Libra Moon asks you to honor the needs of others, too. Don't succumb to the illusion of urgency; you have more time than you realize. Ultimately, your patience will be rewarded if you step up to support the ones you love."
taurus,2014-07-05,"You wake up eager to finish some projects now that the Moon visits your practical 6th House of Logistics. Although it's the weekend, you still might get bogged down with the details and have trouble putting your work aside. It's okay to withdraw for a while if you feel like you are on information overload. Don't worry about what is left undone; others are not likely as concerned about your accomplishments as you are now. All work and no play is not a sound strategy to achieve happiness."
gemini,2014-07-05,"Even if you typically thrive on lots of social interaction, you can still get thrown off course when the noise level gets too loud. Unfortunately, it may seem as if you can't find the volume control today and there is little you can do to tone down the annoying interference. Remember that even if it seems otherwise, the current static is internal and not external. Participating in activities that soothe your soul goes a long way to improve your mood. Everyone needs to escape from the demands of the real world now and then."
cancer,2014-07-05,"You have a variety of possible paths to follow today, yet it's nearly impossible to see where each one leads. Even if you think that a practical decision will set your day right, a midday surprise might turn your plans inside out anyhow. Don't give in to your fears by acting in an emotionally conservative manner. Ironically, your safest choices now are the most radical ones. Take a risk; you might feel surprisingly exhilarated if you try something totally out of your comfort zone."
leo,2014-07-05,"Your actions speak louder than words on most days, but might fall short today. You prefer to talk about your emotions, although it may not be easy to start an overdue discussion with a loved one about a difficult subject now. Even if you have a disagreement, you will still feel relieved after the dust settles. There's no time like the present; just jump into the conversation before you lose your nerve. Be courageous and don't stop roaring until your message is heard."
virgo,2014-07-05,"Your analytical powers are operating on a highly efficient level today, but it still may be impossible to tease out the most useful information from the rest of the noise. There might be too much data for you to discern which bits are the important ones. Nevertheless, stick with your task the best you can. Everything will likely make a lot more sense later tomorrow once the stress begins to subside and your clarity returns."
libra,2014-07-05,"Emotional issues have moved to the forefront of your life now that the evocative Moon is joining passionate Mars in your sign. Don't fight the lunar tides by trying to resist your volatile feelings, even if old memories surface and temporarily make you angry. This is your chance to get in touch with your heart so you can better understand what you need in your current relationships. You don't have to act on every changing mood as long as you let the energy rise and fall without rational interference. You can't always control circumstances but you can choose how to respond."
scorpio,2014-07-05,"You could feel as if your nerves are on edge today and may even lose control of your temper before you know it. Thankfully, the chance of this outburst happening now is not as great as it seems, for the planetary turmoil is not significant enough to create major stress. However, if there is already frustration building, current annoyances can produce a trigger reaction that acts as a catalyst. But without a preexisting cause, you might just feel a bit bent out of shape. Consider your options and make sure an issue is worth the drama before unleashing your emotions."
sagittarius,2014-07-05,"Making up your mind with respect to a group activity may cause you extra worry today. You want to participate in the fun, yet you could feel as if your energies would be better placed somewhere else now. Your choice probably won't matter in the long run as much as you expect. You will likely remain ambivalent about your decision either way so you might as well follow your bliss."
capricorn,2014-07-05,"Something could be gnawing at your confidence today and working harder doesn't seem to make it go away. You might have a bone to pick with someone and you want to clear the air; however, current circumstances could make it quite inconvenient to stir up unresolved issues. Even if you're tempted to blow everything out into the open now, you can improve your chances for a mutually beneficial outcome by waiting until the emotional intensity passes before sharing your feelings. Timing is everything."
aquarius,2014-07-05,"You might have misjudged the size of a job and now must face the consequences of your error. Maybe your expectations are blown out of proportion as you look forward to turning work into play. Whatever the situation, you're not going to get out of it, even if you feel like making a mad dash for the exit when no one is looking. Resign yourself to doing what you said you would. Being the responsible one in the group casts you in a favorable light. Happily, the level of satisfaction you experience later on will make your extra efforts worthwhile."
pisces,2014-07-05,"You may approach your feelings in an overly logical manner today, even though this isn't your natural style. Normally, you just jump in and swim in the emotional waters without too much analysis. However, your mind is working overtime now as you try to sort out what's really going on inside your heart. Don't fight this process because it's not just mental gymnastics; you really stand to benefit from your current intellectual exercise. A little objectivity will do you a world of good."
aries,2014-07-06,"You may need to be reminded to talk about your feelings today, although you might resist this friendly advice at first. Nevertheless, time is running out and the window of opportunity could be closing before you know it. It's crucial to speak your personal truth now. Keep in mind that you're not responsible for how others react to your message; you are merely responsible for delivering it with as much compassion and awareness as possible."
taurus,2014-07-06,"A day of total rest sounds good at first, but too much relaxation leads to boredom rather than satisfaction. There is a variety of things you want to do, but for some reason it's difficult to get motivated. Don't be too self-critical if you don't accomplish a lot now; just do what makes you feel the most comfortable. Sometimes an easygoing weekend spent in the pursuit of simple pleasures is exactly what you need to get back on track."
gemini,2014-07-06,"You are at a critical turning point and might be ready to explore the source of the tension in your life. This emotional journey can be particularly significant if you have recently avoided acknowledging stressful dynamics within an intimate relationship. The sensory overload from the past few days may subside enough for you to uncover what's beneath the surface noise now. Bringing hidden issues into the open sets the stage for inevitable transformation. The sooner you start the dialogue, the more positive the outcome."
cancer,2014-07-06,"You grow less interested in planning for your future and more concerned with achieving immediate satisfaction as the day wears on. Although you may be in touch with your desires, people might think you are hiding something important. However, worrying about anyone else's judgment is a total waste of energy. Listen to your heart and encourage others to do the same."
leo,2014-07-06,"You are full of big ideas about how to make your dreams come true today. You really want to experience pleasure, but you can end up missing out on a good time if you reach too far and fall short of your expectations. Instead of overinflating your hopes, change your attitude and be grateful for what you have. Happiness comes from counting your blessings rather than always longing for more."
virgo,2014-07-06,"Operating with self-restraint feels all too familiar these days. Even if the situation at work is beginning to turn around now, you thought you would be farther along than you actually are. The timing of progress is like the tides; they shift according to their own rhythm and not yours. Talking about your situation with someone you respect helps you to prepare for the upcoming transitions. In the meantime, entertain all options without attaching singular importance to any one of them."
libra,2014-07-06,"Someone may come into your life to help you manage your finances today, but you might see the offer as a potential threat. This doesn't mean that anyone is going to wave a magic wand and simply make your problems disappear; instead, you must learn how to value yourself so that others recognize your worth, too. Remain open to different points of view. Your perspective can undergo fundamental change if you take to heart what's being said now -- and this is exactly what the doctor ordered."
scorpio,2014-07-06,"Clean up old emotional business while there is still time, for your life is about to change for the better. Stick to your regular routine until the real action begins; paying attention to the details can make or break the success of what is to come. Focus on what needs to be done today without worrying about the future. Setting clear priorities now enables you to make room for the next wave of exciting opportunities to arrive."
sagittarius,2014-07-06,"There are serious issues that require your attention now, but you may have a difficult time concentrating on any one of them for too long. It's not that your mind is wandering; it's just that you prefer to think about lighter, more enjoyable matters. But it's not a good idea to escape into your daydreams until you process what is on your plate of reality. Take time to deal with whatever remains unexpressed in your relationships before drifting back into your fantasy world."
capricorn,2014-07-06,"Speaking honestly about what's on your mind today might not seem like a plausible option since you don't want to stir up any unpleasant feelings. You've been dealing with disruptive energy for weeks, but only in minor dosages. However, your anger will be less problematic in the long run if you can express it with kindness. Remember, a good conversation has two points of view. Giving others a chance to share their sides of the story, too, helps to establish common ground."
aquarius,2014-07-06,"Although you're willing to try old things in new ways, you don't know yet which approach will work best for you. Thankfully, nearly everything you do now seems to be propitiously timed. However, the end results could be even better if you continue to build momentum while clever Mercury is activating  your 5th House of Self-Expression until July 13. Don't give up if you encounter any obstacles to your progress; your resilience is formidable, so keep trying until you succeed."
pisces,2014-07-06,"The water energy is flowing freely again and you Fish are among those who can intuitively sense the elemental shifts. However, it's not just about blindly following your instincts. You actually feel better now if you exert some self-control to prove that you're not at the whim of changeable emotions. Making prudent choices is easier today if you stay in touch with your immediate goals instead of being distracted by all the possible paths to pleasure. You can't always get what you want, but you can get what you need."
aries,2014-07-07,"Life is complicated when you feel one thing but end up doing something else. Although your head is in conflict with your heart today, this stressful condition isn't as bad as it sounds. There's no easy way to satisfy both sides of the equation, but then again, who says that you have to now? Taking other people's feelings into consideration can help you make a decision as long as you remember to keep your own needs within your awareness, too. It may be impossible to please everyone, but your efforts won't go unnoticed."
taurus,2014-07-07,"You're motivated by internal forces today and you need to be even more responsible than usual -- especially when revealing your feelings. Something is pulling your heart into deeper and more passionate waters, and you want to share this memorable experience in order to capture the magic of the moment. However, the more you talk about it, the more difficult it is to define. Remaining silent might just be your key to satisfaction. Sometimes the most meaningful experiences can't be expressed in words."
gemini,2014-07-07,"You may be anticipating a deep and powerful wave of emotions, but it's not quite yet washing upon the shores of your consciousness. Nevertheless, something big is brewing out there in the greater cosmos -- and it's heading your way. Your moods can come and go today, but the sinking sensation that you need to face a significant issue will be around for a while. Take your time and be open to an important life lesson. It's never too late to learn a new trick."
cancer,2014-07-07,"One of your greatest strengths is the gentle control you exert on your environment in order to make it safer for those you love. This nurturing instinct is a natural inclination for Cancers, and you can create a hard outer shell large enough to contain your family and loved ones. You are taking this role of responsibility quite seriously now, but your altruistic concerns may not be fully appreciated today. Quiet persistence is your best course of action; let your heart be your guide."
leo,2014-07-07,"You are a champion when it comes to demonstrating your appreciation and love, but logistics are standing in your way now. Perhaps the timing isn't just right or maybe the object of your affection isn't within listening range. It's even possible that he or she doesn't know you exist. Take whatever frustrations you experience in stride, for they will quickly pass as long as you maintain your composure. Your sense of humor is your saving grace."
virgo,2014-07-07,A solution to your current problems may be discovered in how you relate to other people. It could feel like friends and associates are holding you back for some unknown reason. Or it's possible that you have social obligations you prefer to skip. Your resentment can backfire if you don't tell people exactly what you need. Others can't be held responsible for your unhappiness if they don't know what you want. Taking a risk and sharing your feelings fosters the cooperation that you crave.
libra,2014-07-07,"You might feel the resistance as you share your desires with someone you trust today. Unfortunately, there's not a lot you can do to clear the obstacles from your path. Whatever -- or whoever -- is blocking your progress now, it's not significant enough to confront it directly.  If you make a big deal out of the issue, the tension could drain more energy from you than if you just let the situation pass. The less attention you give the negativity, the less it rattles your cage. Focusing on what you can change is your recipe for success."
scorpio,2014-07-07,"The idea of starting a project today may sound better than actually doing anything about it. Ultimately, you must honor your values, for they are critically important to your success. Maintaining integrity with your beliefs can now have the greatest impact on your current situation. However, if you choose to follow your own path, you might temporarily feel out on a limb alone. Thankfully, pursuing your heart's desire empowers you to reclaim your abandoned priorities and strive to actualize your potential."
sagittarius,2014-07-07,"It's nearly impossible for you to be sad about much of anything now, but this doesn't mean you can't also be serious about what's going on in your life. Actually, your current tendency toward being overly responsible may curtail the more pleasurable activities you had originally planned for today. But don't waste any energy thinking about the fun you might be missing. Believe it or not, the satisfaction you derive from a job well done will outlast the transient pleasure of a good time."
capricorn,2014-07-07,"A partner or an associate may deliver a reality check today -- and if you are receptive to the message, there's a lot you can gain from what you hear. However, if someone is hypercritical, take their words with a grain of salt. It's not that you should ignore the truth or deny the facts. There's no reason to spiral down to the depths of self-doubt, either. Instead, consider the advice as a gift from the universe; use what's valid and then throw out the rest. Your willingness to improve your strategy now bodes well for your future success."
aquarius,2014-07-07,"You may feel suddenly excluded from a group that has been an important part of your life recently. Many Aquarians have mixed emotions with respect to social dynamics, anyhow. Ideally, you want to be an integral part of the community, but you also have a strong desire to establish your own separate identity. However, you might have personal issues that currently demand your attention. Thankfully, once you straighten out your affairs, you can jump back into the action with a clear conscience and an undivided focus."
pisces,2014-07-07,"Unfortunately, this is not a day made for daydreaming. You may find yourself being pulled back into the mundane world every time you drift off into one of your lovely reveries. Although you want to express your creativity, real needs require real attention. However, this still can be a wonderful day unless you try to sidestep your responsibilities. If you commit to fulfilling your obligations first, then all should go as smoothly as can be expected. Your hard work pays off in more ways than you know."
aries,2014-07-08,"Someone may be overbearing in ways that make you uncomfortable today, yet it's difficult to confront the situation without creating additional turmoil. Nevertheless, things aren't better left unsaid now. Playing by the rules doesn't ensure satisfaction. Be courageous and speak your mind; don't let others limit your choices. If you are careful not to push too hard or too fast, you can bend reality in your favor. Just remember that with power comes responsibility."
taurus,2014-07-08,"Others might be so dramatic today that your first inclination is to turn around and run. But don't retreat so fast because you can learn plenty about your relationships if you are open to the issues at hand. However, you must push past your fear of change; you could be a lot happier once you reach the other side of a much-needed discussion. It's not as scary as it seems at first."
gemini,2014-07-08,"A variety of relationship issues could be jostling for your attention now, yet personal demands and faulty assumptions get in the way of your career path. There is a potential conflict brewing between your needs and the expectations of others. Don't let your desire to be your authentic self interfere with your productivity. It's up to you to figure out how to do your job without sacrificing your independence. Knowing the difference between what's important and what's not makes all the difference in the world."
cancer,2014-07-08,"Your inspiration motivates you to take the lead, especially at work, but it's hard to know how assertive you should be now. Thankfully, you might see the big picture from vantage points that often elude you. Don't ignore important details, but remember that you may not be able to micromanage your plan. You could be a fountain of ingenuity today, but try not to go crazy in your desire to be unconventional. Find a way to fit your radical ideas into a practical container."
leo,2014-07-08,"Your excitement is building yet someone might think you're coming on a bit too strong. It's fine to feel optimistic about the current circumstances, but there is a thin line between cultivating a positive attitude and being in denial. If you are overly enthusiastic about the possibilities, consider the fact that you could be hiding the truth from yourself. Give your plans more time to develop; trust your instincts to know when it's safe to bring them out into the open."
virgo,2014-07-08,"A radical change of direction could be your best strategy today to handle an unexpected outburst from a close friend or partner. You can't control the behavior of others, but at least you can positively impact your immediate future by carefully contemplating your response. Narrow thinking isn't useful now; nitpicking won't bring satisfaction or happiness. Instead, meet someone halfway in order to demonstrate your willingness to keep an open mind."
libra,2014-07-08,"Your schedule might change dramatically today as simple tasks become mired in details. Your tendency may be to try to do everything as you originally planned, yet it is more efficient to choose what is most critical and focus your attention solely on that now. Don't get overly vested in maintaining the status quo; letting go of control clears the way for something better to enter your life. Paradoxically, your natural grace and flexibility leads to greater stability."
scorpio,2014-07-08,"Although your emotional needs may be off the charts now, you still might be able to find satisfaction. The key to your current success lies in the unconventional approach you take to expressing your feelings. Others enjoy your frankness and originality today. In fact, even those who previously opposed your efforts could be converted by your brilliant style, especially if you back your performance up with substance."
sagittarius,2014-07-08,"Your fantasies could easily overtake reality today if you let them. Your secrets may isolate you from others, so it's critical that you untangle your inner world enough to express your thoughts clearly. If it seems as if someone is undermining your efforts, don't waste time playing the blame game. Instead, search deep within to see what you are hiding from the rest of the world. If you can bring the truth out into the open, then the resistance might dissipate as quickly as it came."
capricorn,2014-07-08,"Your friends distract you from your work today, and although you could easily enjoy yourself, it's not wise to let your responsibilities slide. Take time to address your current obligations before slipping out for a long and lazy lunch. Even if you choose to slightly bend a rule or two now, don't bend the truth in order to justify your actions. Pushing the envelope is perfectly acceptable as long as your words don't lose their integrity."
aquarius,2014-07-08,"The emotional intensity you are experiencing at work can take a lot out of you now, but the rewards are potentially great. Don't put up obstacles by imagining all the things that might go wrong; instead, jump in with a positive attitude. Keep your eyes on your ultimate destination. If you are unrelenting in your belief of your own success, then you will continue to get closer to reaching it day by day."
pisces,2014-07-08,"You may daydream of escaping a humdrum existence today. Your imaginative wanderings can point you in the right direction and lead you to successfully break out of your current cycle of boredom. Happily, your routines will likely change for the better without a lot of effort on your part. Don't force any issues because you could alienate others with your passionate persuasion now. Instead, just set your course and take the first steps of your journey while the planets are favoring your actions."
aries,2014-07-09,"You may jump out of bed raring to go today, but your enthusiasm for life fades into weariness as the day progresses. Fortunately, you're able to pull through and do whatever must be done, even if you lack some of your regular vim and vigor. Don't fret about your shortage of energy now. Keep plowing through your work and you will be justly rewarded. Showing up is half the battle."
taurus,2014-07-09,"You're confident enough about your stability now that you can listen to what others are saying without fear of being swept up into their turbulent storms. Even if your emotions are charged with passion today, they are probably well grounded. Don't refrain from sharing your feelings; no matter what you might encounter, you are certainly capable of holding your own position while still meeting someone else halfway."
gemini,2014-07-09,"Although you may have an exciting event on your calendar today, your commitments at work might keep you from your plans. You tend to indulge in your share of social activities; however, consider saving the fun and games for another day, no matter how much you want to pursue pleasure. Ironically, a pragmatic approach to scheduling your time is more satisfying now than a few passing hours of recreation."
cancer,2014-07-09,"Serious feelings about love and romance can dominate your thoughts today. It's not that you're singing the blues; instead, you're oddly empowered by a sense of realism that settles over your life now. You have a clear idea of what you want and a workable plan for obtaining it. On the other hand, it's possible that you're quite satisfied with the dynamics of your current relationships. Either way, don't let other people's expectations pull you away from what you already know to be true. Follow your heart and the rest will fall into place."
leo,2014-07-09,"Things have started to shift energetically since yesterday and others may not realize how inwardly-directed your thought process is now. You are quite adept at keeping up outer appearances, but you might not reveal how entangled you are with your own feelings. If you are split between your inner and outer worlds, don't be distracted by external events. Trust your intuition to lead you in the right direction."
virgo,2014-07-09,"This is a very emotional time because you have a detailed picture of what you want to convey to someone near and dear to you. However, you are also feeling uncertain of the response you might receive and wonder if it would be wiser and kinder to keep some of your desires to yourself. Although it may seem like an all-or-nothing proposition, you can test the waters by sharing just a little bit at first. Step in the shallow end and then wait until you get a reaction before deciding whether or not to dive in deeper."
libra,2014-07-09,"You can significantly improve the dynamics of an ongoing conflict with someone at work today by making use of your natural gift for diplomacy. In fact, once you begin a true dialogue, the previous disagreement might suddenly seem like a trivial matter. Thankfully, it's easy to find common ground now because both parties appear more willing to forgive and forget than to squabble over who's right. Just don't sweep a difficult topic under the rug or you might miss out on a very liberating conversation."
scorpio,2014-07-09,"Slow and steady is definitely the best course of action as you seek support for your innovative plan today. Unfortunately, you might feel the need to push against whatever resistance you may receive from others. It seems as if now is the time to state your case, but this sense of urgency is an illusion. There's no reason to panic; you have all the tools you need to build solid foundations. Acting with integrity is more important than rushing ahead to prove your point."
sagittarius,2014-07-09,"You may currently be in the midst of an existential dilemma. Although everything appears to be in order and you believe that the time for taking initiative is now, something is still amiss. You can't shake the feeling that your intended actions seem destined to fail. Timing is everything and you can waste valuable resources pushing against an immovable force if you try to make something happen. Patience is an admirable virtue, but your philosophical outlook could save the day."
capricorn,2014-07-09,"Your biggest concern today is trying to determine the best way to reach your goals. Your battle plans have been drawn and you're moving closer and closer toward executing your strategy. However, your sixth sense is telling you to wait a bit longer. You might be more fortunate if you postpone a major move but, in the meantime, do something that solidifies your intentions. Small, steady actions today greatly improve your chances for long-term success."
aquarius,2014-07-09,"You are in a unique position to make the most of your current situation at work, but you must step up to the plate and take the initiative. Nevertheless, you wonder if you can make the first move without upsetting your coworkers with your bold behavior. You don't want to appear like you're making a power play, since your overly ambitious nature could inadvertently offend others today. Explain your motives in detail to gain trust from your peers. If your presentation is successful, they might even want to be a part of your plan."
pisces,2014-07-09,"You intuitively sense that the wild roller coaster ride of life is finally beginning to slow down, even if you still feel on an emotional edge today. You can't just jump off yet, but you can see an escape route out of a difficult situation that has pushed and pulled you long enough. Don't worry if you have to give up something in the negotiation process to get what you want. Make sure you have your priorities in order and be crystal clear when sharing them with others. Your transparency allows those closest to you to understand your true intentions."
aries,2014-07-10,"Positive feelings linger as if you're under a magic spell, and yet you realize your optimism can't last forever. Your return to earth might be abrupt if your self-confidence begins to wane. You may think letting others know what's on your mind will fix your problems, but sharing too much creates more trouble than it solves. Discretion is advised today or you could needlessly hurt the feelings of someone you like. If you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all."
taurus,2014-07-10,"You feel like being on your own today, but there may be too many demands on your time to completely withdraw. Unfortunately, satisfaction is elusive regardless of your schedule. If you are home alone, you can't keep your mind off everything you want to do. And if you are out with friends or family, you just long for some peace and quiet. In any event, don't fall into the trap of blaming your dissatisfaction on anyone else. Graciously accepting the current circumstances frees you up to enjoy yourself in ways you can't yet imagine."
gemini,2014-07-10,"Close friends may be the source of your dilemma du jour, especially if they have an obvious agenda that differs from yours. Social activities can play an important role in the upcoming weekend, but you might grow bored with the agreed-upon schedule. Don't get roped into doing anything you cannot easily change. Staying aware of your ever-changing needs helps prevent awkward tension from developing later on. Treat others with the same respect you would want in return."
cancer,2014-07-10,"Rather than taking charge for any sort of group activity today, you would prefer that everyone shares in the responsibilities. You really don't have much patience now, and everything seem to take longer than it should. Although you may feel the need to enthusiastically hurry others along, take a radical approach and slow down your pace, instead. You may be surprised at how well it works out if you let go of your expectations and simply go along with the flow."
leo,2014-07-10,"You are so eager for a vacation now you can already visualize every aspect to it. Unfortunately, your schedule might prohibit you from taking an extended trip; luckily, a quick weekend getaway should be enough to alleviate the pressure. Don't worry if you haven't made any concrete plans yet. Even a spontaneous day trip could be exactly what you need to recharge your batteries and get your motor running."
virgo,2014-07-10,"A dramatically different approach to how you handle conflict with a partner might be enough to alter a difficult relationship dynamic. But don't expect to suddenly make any gains now without some sort of uncomfortable confrontation. Opening your heart is the first step to demonstrating your trust. Once you put your feelings out into the open, others will be able to engage authentically and this can make all the difference in the world."
libra,2014-07-10,"An interpersonal conflict that's been quietly brewing for several days might suddenly explode on to the scene today. Even if you believe you have an airtight case, keep in mind that someone else might think the exact same thing. Luckily, reality can support multiple points of view, so don't turn this into a fight to the finish. Instead, cultivate harmony by discovering a solution that allows everyone to be a winner."
scorpio,2014-07-10,"Finding new ways to do the same old things brightens your day with much-needed fun and excitement. But just because you have an inventive idea doesn't mean you can turn it into reality overnight. Rather than trying to take on too much and change everything at once, just make a minor modification to your routine and see where it leads. A small adjustment has a greater positive impact than you realize."
sagittarius,2014-07-10,"Although you want to play today, someone's unspoken agenda can still pull on your heartstrings, making it nearly impossible to just go off and have fun. If you choose to ignore other people's feelings, you might end up feeling so guilty that you can't enjoy yourself. Don't be in such a hurry to escape an awkward situation. Lending a supportive shoulder gives you the opportunity to be the kind of friend you would want to have in your corner."
capricorn,2014-07-10,"Staying at home today may not be as relaxing as you wish since the day is chock full of distractions, no matter what you do. Even if you try to block out all the noise, you still might be pulled into the day's events, so why fight it? By involving yourself voluntarily, you will end up feeling more connected to everyone around you. You can manage your time more successfully and ultimately feel better about yourself by simply taking a proactive approach."
aquarius,2014-07-10,"Your day may seem like one little personal crisis after another if you try to spend it in solitude; others will likely be more involved with your business than you wish. But even if you are left alone for a while, you won't be able to completely relax now, for there are work-related tasks to do and errands to run. Although you believe you know what's best for you today, practicing flexibility encourages others to cooperate with your plans. Going along with the crowd has its rewards if you're willing to be a team player."
pisces,2014-07-10,"A bit of retail therapy might elevate your mood today, but this temporary improvement is merely a symptom of a deeper issue. Your values are changing and you're eager to surround yourself with material objects that reflect your new outlook on life. Be honest with yourself and acknowledge your impulse to spend money; however, avoid future regret by making certain that your purchases are more practical than frivolous. Money can't buy you love."
aries,2014-07-11,"You are so set on achieving your goals today that you might not even slow down if someone purposefully obstructs your progress. Unfortunately, direct confrontation isn't the best way to respond to resistance. Although you may be obsessive about your desires now, it makes more sense to take it easy while you come up with a plan of attack. Instead of depleting your energy by pushing the river, relax now while you have the chance."
taurus,2014-07-11,"Your stubborn behavior could serve you well if you're traveling on your desired course, but it can land you in big trouble if you've wandered off track. Nevertheless, you might need a little help from your friends to steer you in the right direction, even if you believe you already know the best way. Don't resist sensible advice from a trustworthy colleague; remain open to all the good ideas you hear. You may receive the most valuable pearls of wisdom from a totally unexpected source."
gemini,2014-07-11,"You may feel awkwardly restrained by circumstances beyond your control today, since you don't have much leeway to express your creativity. You're being challenged to limit your thinking to fit your ideas into the constraints of the day. Even if it seems as if others are putting you in a box, focusing your attention on a narrow spectrum of possibilities now might help you be more effective than you ever imagined."
cancer,2014-07-11,"Someone could get on your nerves today if he or she has an itinerary that doesn't necessarily match up with your own. You quickly lose your cool when others just assume that you will put your agenda on the back burner to assist their cause. Although you may choose to bury your true feelings and be a team player, this tactic won't bring satisfaction in the long run. Common sense rules now, so support the best plan no matter who thought of it first."
leo,2014-07-11,"Holding on to unresolved feelings can complicate relationship dynamics today. In the big scheme of things you know that it's best to adapt to change and just move on, but clinging to the past might be your way of maintaining some semblance of control now. It's healthier to acknowledge your emotions without obsessing about them. Ironically, adopting a more philosophical attitude puts you back in the driver's seat before you know it."
virgo,2014-07-11,"You might be dreaming about a spiritual journey that's for your steps alone. Even if you're exploring ways to reclaim your power, current circumstances may not support your plan at first. But don't attempt to manipulate others to act in your favor. Your strength returns naturally as you rediscover your metaphysical center of gravity. Realign with your core values and exhibit the highest integrity possible in all that you do."
libra,2014-07-11,"You might be annoyed with yourself now if you didn't already let someone know exactly how you're feeling. Thankfully, you can gain clarity in a way that previously eluded you. Don't question your analytical capabilities even if you find it difficult to integrate all the data at your fingertips. Plotting your next move is a waste of energy today; staying in the present moment and observing your emotions has the most  positive impact on your future."
scorpio,2014-07-11,"You may be in a position now to receive emotional support that's long overdue. Don't try to sidestep change, whether or not others come forward to offer personal assistance today. Although you could feel pressure to perform, it still seems as if your world is becoming a friendlier place. You might need to delay handling an unresolved relationship issue, but there's no reason to continue worrying about it. Instead, concentrate on keeping your balance as the big waves of transformation wash through your life."
sagittarius,2014-07-11,"It hasn't been all that easy to fully relax lately because so many different avenues seem to lead to fun and adventure. You are relieved that your schedule isn't as hectic today because there may be a few serious issues that need your undivided attention. Unfortunately, you might be missing some relevant information, but you're willing to dig around for it. Nevertheless, everyone -- including you -- requires a bit of downtime, so accept any peace and quiet as a gift from the cosmos. Counting your blessings is a wonderful way to remember what's most important."
capricorn,2014-07-11,"You might be feeling content now that both feet are firmly planted on stable ground. However, you are already wondering when to take your next step and exactly where you're going. Although you may be experiencing a bout of uncharacteristic self-doubt today, it won't last long if you are committed to your goals. Nevertheless, you can sink into your emotions while the Moon travels through your sign. You can't afford to get lazy; do your planning right away instead of waiting until you're in the middle of the next storm."
aquarius,2014-07-11,"Trusting your mind over relying on your heart is often appropriate when making decisions; however, the tables are turning now. You're drawn to the idea of intimacy and may be willing to overlook the facts for an opportunity to intensify a relationship. You've been thinking about pushing past your resistance for a while, but powerful emotions can still leave you feeling uncomfortable. Remember, although you aren't required to share you secrets all at once, there's no time like the present moment to start turning fantasies into reality."
pisces,2014-07-11,"It's wise to involve others in your planning process today, since group participation makes your day more enjoyable and efficient at the same time. Don't allow old fears of failure to sabotage your current dreams by filling you with doubt before you even start. Your friends and coworkers may enter the picture with important keys to your future, and if you don't welcome their presence with open arms, you'll never know what might be possible. Have faith; anything can happen."
aries,2014-07-12,"Your self-doubt makes it tough to stay positive today as you consider your place in the world. You might grow annoyed if everything doesn't go your way now that the ambitious Capricorn Full Moon rattles your 10th House of Responsibility. The good news is that you can be close to people who have goals that are very different from yours. Reconsidering your assumptions is healthy as long as you don't mistrust your own logic, even if your choices are not what others expect."
taurus,2014-07-12,"Your current caution may be justifiable today because it's crucial to send the right message when you finally reveal what's on your mind. But hesitating too long isn't a good idea or you might miss your chance to influence the thinking of those around you. The calculating Capricorn Full Moon stirs your 9th House of Adventure, conjuring up dreams of exotic travel. However, keep in mind that your plans will continue to evolve. Nevertheless, the sooner you start engineering your future, the better."
gemini,2014-07-12,"Saying yes to friends could be a really smart move today if you don't inflate your expectations so high that you end up being disappointed. Meanwhile, chatty Mercury and charming Venus are in your fickle sign, making it easy to skirt around uncomfortable subjects. Thankfully, the dutiful Capricorn Full Moon brightens your 8th House of Deep Sharing, requiring you to overcome your resistance and tackle a difficult issue. Choose your topic carefully; consider all the consequences before attempting to reach for the stars. The best relationships are built on a foundation of give and take."
cancer,2014-07-12,"Interpersonal dynamics may be stretched to the breaking point as today's Capricorn Full Moon intensifies your 7th House of Companions. Unfortunately, your emotions aren't as rational as you think, so don't assume that a current disagreement is troublesome unless you know all the details. Your satisfaction isn't as dependent on the reactions of others as you might believe. Create a safe haven within your own mind, where your feelings are determined more by your attitude than by events in the outer world. Meaningful conversations are possible when you come from a place of love."
leo,2014-07-12,"You have lots to complete before you can begin the more relaxing part of the weekend -- and the quicker you jump into your chores, the sooner you finish them. Nevertheless, the conscientious Capricorn Full Moon lands in your 6th House of Details, suggesting that you should focus on the little things rather than on the bigger picture. Wrap up all the loose ends first; then you will feel guilt free about moving on to something that is more fun."
virgo,2014-07-12,"You could be on such a tight schedule that it's challenging to get in touch with your creativity. Thankfully, your busyness works in your favor now because your overall efficiency is at its peak when you don't have time to get lost in your thoughts. Today's Capricorn Full Moon activates your 5th House of Self-Expression, inspiring you to follow your heart. Don't take everything so seriously; enjoying your journey enables you to remain connected to your muse, even when you're focusing on the mundane tasks at hand. Whistle while you work."
libra,2014-07-12,"You are driven to push past the surface and get to the bottom of a complex situation as today's determined Capricorn Full Moon illuminates your 4th House of Roots. You might be too unsettled to share your fears with anyone else, but you could discover that the situation changes for the better once you shine the light of awareness onto your concerns. Don't delay; a significant discussion now may shift your perspective in a positive direction faster than you can imagine. Confession is good for the soul."
scorpio,2014-07-12,"You are acutely aware of how your feelings affect your attempts to be objective. You may believe that you're considering all the facts, yet you still might fall prey to your illusion of reality instead of accepting the actual truth. Fortunately, today's earthy Capricorn Full Moon lights up your 3rd House of Communication, prompting you to tell everyone what you need. But steer away from idle chatter or trivial discussions. Don't suffer any fools; cut to the chase and maintain your integrity at all costs."
sagittarius,2014-07-12,Spending money frivolously now is not wise because the serious Capricorn Full Moon floods your 2nd House of Possessions with heightened subjectivity. You could develop an emotional attachment to nearly any object that is currently on your radar. A purchase today may be based less on logic and more on a whim. Avoid buyer's remorse by waiting a few days before acquiring something you really don't need. Re-evaluate your priorities and create a sensible budget that can carry you these tricky times.
capricorn,2014-07-12,"You may feel anxious today if you get caught up in a drama that you would normally avoid. Today's Full Moon in your pragmatic sign symbolizes an existential crisis as your emotions collide with your ambitions. Your desire to succeed is formidable now, making it nearly impossible to establish a clear perspective on what you want. Don't make any demands on others until you can objectively clarify what you truly need. In the meantime, explore your feelings and figure out where you want to go."
aquarius,2014-07-12,"Shaking off a confusing dream is difficult today, even after you are fully awake, because the Capricorn Moon disturbs your 12th House of Soul Consciousness. However, forgetting your vision is futile now, so contemplate the message that's being sent from your subconscious, instead. Don't be concerned if it eludes logic; simply replaying the images in your mind can be enough to alter your perspective. Your imagination holds the keys to the buried treasures within."
pisces,2014-07-12,"You truly appreciate having supportive friends on your side and you're eager to express your gratitude. The ambitious Capricorn Full Moon shines in your 11th House of Social Networking, encouraging you to connect with others who share your values. Nevertheless, there's so much going on in your head now that you just want to be left alone with your own thoughts. Even if your calendar is already booked, find a way to create a bit of quiet time to indulge in the peace of solitude."
aries,2014-07-13,"You're so popular with your friends that it might be a challenge to find time to be by yourself today. You may be swept up in a series of events where you lose your individuality, becoming just another face in the crowd and feeling lost in the group process. The bottom line is that the more you participate and express your opinions now, the better the outcome. You have something special to offer and others are counting on you to show up and put your best foot forward."
taurus,2014-07-13,"Although your drive to establish your role in the community is unstoppable now, you may still be confused as to the best way to proceed. You want to share your feelings with others, but you can also choose to remain quiet if it seems like the timing is wrong. Unfortunately, postponing communication cuts you off emotionally from those closest to you. Meanwhile, someone might draw you in with their persuasive charm and you could end up spilling the beans, anyway. Balancing the desires of your heart with the logic of your head keeps you moving in the right direction."
gemini,2014-07-13,"You're looking ahead with a smile on your face as the potential for pleasure continues to swirl around you. Even if you want to be practical with your plans, you still might be caught up in your need for adventure now. Although you may want to jump in with both feet, it's smarter to proceed slowly with both eyes wide open. Until you honestly re-evaluate your current position and share it with others, you won't be free to move into the future."
cancer,2014-07-13,"You might feel an odd sensation in your gut today as you stop to get in touch with your intuitive self. It's as if you were issued a private invitation to the unveiling of a cosmic mystery. However, you may not be able to settle comfortably into your emotions because mental Mercury just entered your sign, prompting you to over analyze your feelings. Don't say anything about your inner process until you're ready; the issues could resolve on their own with just a few days of constructive contemplation."
leo,2014-07-13,"Someone may encourage you to step up and push past your comfort zone today. You are expected to consider the needs of others and not just concentrate on your own desires. However, there's a part of you that just isn't buying the story, no matter how good it sounds. Suspend your disbelief and trust the process for now. Don't question everyone's motives; be a team player this time around and, surprisingly, everything might work out for the good of all."
virgo,2014-07-13,"You could be worried about falling into a rut with your regular weekend regimen and can't help but feel like you need more independence. Part of the problem is that you don't want to act inconsiderately while making changes. You certainly have no intention to hurt anyone's feelings as you pull back from your domestic responsibilities. In the meantime, maintain the status quo for now; the time for shaking things up will come soon enough."
libra,2014-07-13,"No matter how busy you are today, you're still inclined to take some time off to play as assertive Mars in your sign harmonizes with flirty Venus. Understandably, you're more eager to experience spontaneous fun now than you are interested in fulfilling your obligations. Nevertheless, allow plenty of time for meeting your prior commitments before making a beeline for the exit. Adopting a conservative approach to your responsibilities early in the day means you get to be even more creative later on in your pursuit of pleasure."
scorpio,2014-07-13,"You may feel a strong connection with humanitarian and environmental issues that compulsively drives you to take action now. You're motivated to change the rules so the current social conditions are more supportive of your goals, but others are not moving as quickly as you wish. Remember to focus on the long haul and not only on what you can accomplish today. Don't give up hope just because you might feel overwhelmed or disenfranchised. Patience and  faith are instrumental ingredients in creating a gradual yet permanent shift."
sagittarius,2014-07-13,"You could be so annoyed with a situation in your immediate environment that you decide to change it for the better. You believe a solution can be found, even if it's not fully implemented today. Unfortunately, your penchant for change might run into resistance since others are vested in the status quo. Nevertheless, your own personal happiness may be linked to releasing them from their outmoded beliefs. Let your natural optimism rise to the surface and communicate the truth as you see it."
capricorn,2014-07-13,"There are signs all around you now reminding you to conserve your energy, but you have to pay close attention to notice them. You're receiving concrete messages about the purpose of your life, but may have problems integrating the vision into your real world. Your values could clash with what you must do, but today isn't the best day for radical action, anyhow. Use this time for quiet contemplation, but prepare to shift into high gear over the next couple of weeks."
aquarius,2014-07-13,"Staying on course is challenging now that the changeable Moon is back in your sign. Sweet and shiny distractions lure you one way, and then another. Make the most of this emotionally tumultuous time by creating something special within the realms of your vivid imagination. Then, consciously and deliberately project your inner world onto the outer circumstances. Don't suppress your dreams; letting them out of the closet will surely bring more excitement to your day and add rich inspiration to your life."
pisces,2014-07-13,"Swimming in the deep waters of your own imagination can be a luxurious and refreshing experience. However, it's critical to understand that an inner symbolic journey might trigger a deep longing for meaning that cannot be easily found in the outer world. This could be a bit discouraging now unless you consciously stay grounded in reality. Luckily, turning negativity into a positive force is possible by feeling the same gentle compassion for yourself that you have for others."
aries,2014-07-14,"You're not very motivated today and you might try to slide by without putting out a lot of effort. The social aspects of your job may be more important now than what you actually accomplish. But even if you don't have to go to work, getting out of the house is a smart idea, for it can take your mind off tedious domestic responsibilities and confusing relationship dynamics. Just remember that you can't escape from reality; it will still be waiting for you when you return. Enjoy the reprieve while you have the chance."
taurus,2014-07-14,"Attacking an old problem in a different way can help to break unhealthy patterns of co-dependency. It's important to come through for those you love, yet you are more apt to work harder when you don't feel uncomfortable pressure from their unreasonable demands. Instead of trying to make nice, let others know that you need to take some time for yourself today. Everyone will appreciate your wisdom when you return with a new and improved attitude."
gemini,2014-07-14,"Your need for freedom can express itself in a variety of ways, but this may not be an auspicious time to hop on an airplane and take a trip. Keep in mind the duality of the current situation; not only are you thinking about going somewhere else, you're also escaping from something restrictive. Consciously shift your focus so you can clearly see what has held you back from following your dreams. Planning your future is exciting once you acknowledge what you're trying to leave behind in your past."
cancer,2014-07-14,"Your desire for intimacy might sound better in theory now than it turns out in reality, since your emotional needs don't necessarily translate easily into language. Remember, with thoughtful Mercury in your cautious sign until the end of the month, it may take additional time to be able to put your feelings into words. Don't try to push this process too fast or you may have to start all over again sooner than you think."
leo,2014-07-14,"Try not to take it too personally if your partner seems emotionally remote today, especially since his or her issues might not even be about you. Nevertheless, the negative energy still could be aimed in your direction. Instead of withdrawing in a passive-aggressive manner or denying the distance between you and others, consciously give everyone the space they need. Rather than hastily attempting to fix things in your outer world, manage what's on your plate by addressing your own attitude first."
virgo,2014-07-14,"Doing the same old thing in the same old way isn't working for you now, making it crucial to break out of any patterns that have already served their purpose. However, part of your bigger problem is in the difficulty you have distinguishing what you call being in a groove from being stuck in a rut. Don't let your insecurities about the past keep you needlessly attached to it for too long. The time for positive change is now."
libra,2014-07-14,"You may be eager for the chance to express your needs clearly in a romantic relationship today with the Moon in your 5th House of Love. However, make sure the other person understands that just because you are asking for additional personal space, you're not necessarily looking for an easy way out. In fact, the extra breathing room might be just what you need now so you can spend time in creative pursuits. Your inner joy rekindles another spark of attraction in the near future; after all, absence often makes the heart grow fonder."
scorpio,2014-07-14,"Although you have spent a lot of time mucking about in your feelings recently, you might be ready to bolt as the reality of the current situation dawns on you today. But don't move too fast because there are still intriguing opportunities that you haven't yet explored. Your overall conclusions may be right on target, but don't assume that you know the best way to react. Continue to reassess all your options very carefully; thankfully, more clarity is on the horizon."
sagittarius,2014-07-14,"The day's events might not cooperate by falling in line with your planned agenda today, but divergence only becomes problematic if you are overly concerned about exercising your authority. In fact, you can enter into a futile struggle if you really think you must demonstrate to the world that you're in charge. There are circumstances beyond your control, so stop fighting the inevitable. A healthy dose of flexibility can save the day."
capricorn,2014-07-14,"Oddly enough, you might feel safe and secure with your current sense of isolation, but you don't particularly appreciate having less than you want. It may not seem all that strange today to begin an austerity program with respect to money, love, and other pleasures -- but you need to know why you're doing it and what the payoff will be later. Acknowledge your frustrations, but wait a while longer before taking any drastic action. Thankfully, practicing a little self-discipline goes a long way to turn things in a positive direction."
aquarius,2014-07-14,"You're at the top of your eccentricity cycle and are eager to demonstrate your unorthodox tendencies now. The Moon delivers a powerful emotional whammy, reactivating your concerns about what happens if you manifest your dreams. Once you acknowledge that your feelings might be bent out of shape, it's easier to justify inaction. Remember, there's no need to express every mood swing with the same intensity as you experience it. Your originality speaks for itself."
pisces,2014-07-14,"It's wise to build your strategy around flying beneath the radar and being as productive as possible today. Although you're naturally in touch with your wide world of dreams, it might not be such a good idea to indiscriminately share your inner process with anyone else yet. In the meantime, treat your fantasies with tender love and care, for they contain the hidden treasures that only you can discover."
aries,2014-07-15,"You might feel a bit emotionally deflated today, especially if you see something you truly want yet know you cannot have. You could even grow annoyed with yourself for falling victim to your own unrealistic expectations. Thankfully, your frown can transform into a smile once you understand that you are the source of your own discontent now. The truth may not be what you wished for, but it still has the power to set you free."
taurus,2014-07-15,"You are on your best behavior today, but still could land in trouble if you assume that you can fix everything that is broken. It's tempting to overestimate the positive results of your actions now. You appreciate a new opportunity, but may become frustrated if it disappears as suddenly as it arrived. Even so, there's no reason for discouragement to come between you and promising prospects. Don't resist; allow your irrepressible dreams to pull you toward success."
gemini,2014-07-15,"You can't justify starting so many unrelated projects now, since your current responsibilities require that you follow one specific task through to completion. Naturally, you're feeling very restless and are inclined to jump from one activity to the next. However, don't attempt to beat the system and move on too soon; ironically, narrowing your focus onto a single goal can actually open new avenues for exploration."
cancer,2014-07-15,"You want nothing more than to live in a free-spirited world of sunshine and flowers today, but reality can't live up to your fantastic expectations. Unfortunately, the Moon's presence in your 9th House of Big Ideas isn't very helpful if you have more practical issues on your plate. Set aside a bit of time for aimless daydreaming, but then let your inspiration guide you gently back to earth."
leo,2014-07-15,"You could have an amazing vision today, and by exercising patience and follow-through you might even be able to produce something special. Even if you're not Mozart or Picasso, a lack of artistic skills need not stand in your way. Although you want your talent to be appreciated, it's more important now to express your creativity whether or not anyone else notices your work. Remember, it's currently more about the process rather than the end results."
virgo,2014-07-15,"You can drive yourself nuts today if you try to focus your attention on answering one single question. Unfortunately, the more you narrow your concentration now, the more your mind escapes the confines of the current situation. The problem is that forced logic morphs into fuzzy thinking. Instead of looking at the dilemma from an objective point of view, just visualize the desired outcome and start off in that direction."
libra,2014-07-15,"You are eager to share your inspirational ideas at work today, but they might not be quite ready for an unforgiving audience yet. It's like a dream that makes perfect sense in your head until you start to tell it to someone else -- and then it quickly fades back into the shadows. Paradoxically, even your most concrete plan begins to shift as you elaborate on the details. Skip the lengthy explanation for now; you can always bring others up to date in a day or two when they're more receptive."
scorpio,2014-07-15,"You don't want to waste your time discussing trivial subjects today but ironically, it seems that you're unable to avoid it. You would rather place the endless stream of words on hold in order to intensify a current emotional dynamic. But you may have to engage in superficial conversations just to make it through the workday. It's not an either/or situation; you can still make time to explore more meaningful topics later with someone you trust. A little friendly banter never hurt anyone."
sagittarius,2014-07-15,"You're on an emotional high while planning for an upcoming journey, yet a quiet uncertainty is beginning to take root and you don't understand why. Concerns about your family or your own personal security may prevent you from traveling anywhere now. Happily, you can go somewhere magical without even leaving home. The advantage of a mental excursion is that no one has to know that you are gone. You can explore the far reaches of the universe in your imagination and still return in the blink of an eye to answer your phone."
capricorn,2014-07-15,"You're not averse to wandering around in the fertile fields of your imagination today; however, you start to feel anxious if you go too far in the process. You may struggle if there's no apparent way to return to solid ground, but your fear is the only thing standing in your way. Avoid stress by consciously staying connected with your work even while you're daydreaming. Be creative, but don't fly so high that you get lost in the clouds."
aquarius,2014-07-15,"It might feel as if you're losing touch with reality today, but your perception is only an illusion. People can't see your inner mental process, so they don't realize that you're struggling to keep it real; actually, your thoughts are quite pragmatic now. You can take advantage of this temporary confusion as long as you don't appear threatening to anyone. Be assertive and push for what you want. You may be pleasantly surprised at the results if you stay within your limits."
pisces,2014-07-15,"You are quite facile at shifting metaphysical gears today and slipping in and out of the real world so fast that no one even notices your absence. Even serious responsibilities won't stop you from indulging in your mini-escapes to other realms now. But instead of trying to squeeze your daydreaming into short moments here and there, consider scheduling a block of time for your metaphysical adventures. Stretching your mind into other dimensions is healthy as long as you also deliver on your promises."
aries,2014-07-16,"Your intuition is sending you images today faster than you can decipher them. Your cosmic antennae are tuned into your imagination, but you're driven by your desire to turn your dreams into reality. Although generous Jupiter occupies your 5th House of Self-Expression for a whole year, there's still no time to waste. Swing into action now; determine the best way to ride the wave of your inspiration as far as it will take you. Let your inner child out to play."
taurus,2014-07-16,"It's easier to express your needs to your friends or associates now than it is to your partner or lover. You may be a bit confused because you're not sure whether to talk openly about your feelings or if it's smarter to keep them to yourself. Although you might be out of sorts today, uplifting Jupiter sails into your 4th House of Security, reminding you to stay in touch with your emotions even if it makes you a bit uncomfortable. Take a calculated risk and share what's in your heart with the people that matter the most."
gemini,2014-07-16,"You feel like a ping-pong ball as you bounce back and forth between two points of view today: the most comprehensively inclusive and the most specifically limited. On one hand, your imagination soars and you can see everything from a global perspective. On the other hand, it's not always easy to act on idealistic visions. Make the best use of visionary Jupiter's move into your 3rd House of Immediate Environment by thinking globally yet acting locally. Exhibit your spirit of generosity everywhere you go."
cancer,2014-07-16,"Although you can often appear as if you are resisting change, you are more highly adaptable than others may realize. After all, you Crabs are wired to flow with the ever-changing tides. But now, as opportunistic Jupiter leaves your sign, the emotional currents are shifting and it might be nearly impossible to tell which way the waters will ultimately be flowing. Acknowledging that you don't yet know where you stand in the new scheme of things alleviates the pressure. Hold tight to your current position for a few days before reconsidering your direction and setting a new course."
leo,2014-07-16,"Your life receives a cosmic booster shot as prosperous Jupiter sets up shop in your sign for a one-year visit. Jupiter tends to make things bigger and better, but too much of anything isn't necessarily beneficial. You are standing at the threshold of a new cycle of growth and opportunity where anything can happen. Think in terms of your long-term goals and begin to move toward them with confidence while the planet of good fortune is in your corner."
virgo,2014-07-16,"Your spiritual and metaphysical interests can take on greater importance these days as philosophical Jupiter makes itself at home in your 12th House of Other Dimensions. Things are beginning to shift, but their long-term effects won't be immediately visible. There are dynamic changes heading your way, but they may unfold in the hidden realms of the subconscious. Let go of your reliance on rational analysis in order to gain the most personal growth from the year ahead."
libra,2014-07-16,"You Libras know a thing or two about balancing the complexities of life, especially when it feels like an uphill battle. You can probably sense the scales tipping away from fulfilling your own needs now that Jupiter's shift into your 11th House of Social Networking favors taking care of everyone else first. But this isn't a new story for you; it's just the next chapter in your book. Keep your energy grounded if you want to avoid crashing into the side of the mountain you are climbing. Don't let your drive to help others stand in the way of your own success."
scorpio,2014-07-16,"Even if you have recently been uncertain about where you are going in your current career, the future starts to make more sense. Your role in the outer world is more important than ever now that Jupiter is gracing your 10th House of Career, requiring you to make your work top priority. But, simultaneously, you also wonder if you should shift directions and place more attention on the inner dimensions of your soul. It's challenging to know where to apply your energy. There are no fast and easy answers; the dilemma remains a complex puzzle to be solved over time."
sagittarius,2014-07-16,"Your dilemma today is like a familiar old friend who comes to visit you from time to time. The visionary Sagittarian can't help but be attracted to the most grandiose plans. You want to live your life in the largest way possible now, yet unattended details may be coming back to haunt you with your key planet Jupiter journeying through your 9th House of Big Ideas. Don't let your exploration of the outer edges of reality carry you so far from home that you can't find your way back. Balance your penchant for adventure with a dash of common sense."
capricorn,2014-07-16,"You may be pulled into the realm of relationships, but you must figure out how to keep both feet on the ground no matter what happens next. Jupiter's visit to your 8th House of Intimacy presents you with complicated emotional issues. Strive to maintain clarity in all your interactions, for it's possible to misunderstand someone's basic values if you make unsubstantiated assumptions. Personal growth is much more likely if you're willing to open your mind and share your heart."
aquarius,2014-07-16,Intimate relationships are a significant source of fulfillment now that benevolent Jupiter has set up camp in your 7th House of Companions. Actively listening to what the other person is saying takes extra concentration because words can actually get in the way of the message. And you certainly won't help the situation by pushing your perspective onto anyone else. Consciously allowing multiple points of view to exist side by side might be enough to dissipate tensions and cultivate trust.
pisces,2014-07-16,"There are unrelenting demands being placed on your shoulders and you may be richly rewarded if you respond to them dutifully now that auspicious Jupiter is calling the shots in your 6th House of Daily Routine. Meeting your obligations in a timely manner requires consistent effort as you check off the items on your to-do list one at a time. Unfortunately, you could find it tricky to maintain such a high level of concentration because your imagination is a master of temptation. Take care of your responsibilities first so you can wander in your dreams with a free conscience later on."
aries,2014-07-17,"Although you can charge forward into the unknown today, it's smarter to consider your options before you find yourself in over your head. Your natural way of overcoming fear is to rush into a situation as soon as you feel the adrenaline building. However, the Moon's shift into your sign puts you in an uncharacteristically sensitive mood, making you more aware of any potential problems. Thankfully, you're adept at thinking on your feet, but a bit of forethought is still advised for the best possible outcome."
taurus,2014-07-17,"You're so energetic today that you think you must hide your excitement or you could upset the delicate balance that's holding everything together. Unfortunately, denying your feelings only increases the intensity of everyone's emotions, rather than alleviating it. A total lack of self-restraint exacerbates a problem, but your options are not limited to an all or nothing response. Be cautious; revealing your feelings gradually prevents others from being overwhelmed by your enthusiasm."
gemini,2014-07-17,"You prefer your friends to be open and honest when they tell you what they need from you today. But simultaneously, you are afraid that their words are masking unexpressed feelings. You might even be tempted to act foolishly if you try to expose someone's hidden agenda. Nevertheless, there's no reason to force an issue now because the truth will become apparent on its own. Your interference might only make matters worse so let others share their secrets when they're ready."
cancer,2014-07-17,"Your desire for everyone to observe your courage in action today motivates you to bury your feelings and push beyond your usual limitations. Your current satisfaction is dependent on your public image, leading you to hide your anxiety so effectively that others think that you are fearless now. However, there is no need to trick anyone into believing that you're a superhero. Just quietly do your very best, and the results will speak for themselves."
leo,2014-07-17,"You are super-excited about all the possibilities for growth and adventure today, yet you are also aware that you must make sacrifices to accomplish your goals. Thankfully, you're not concerned about anything that could get in the way of your success now. In fact, you might be so confident that you assume you can overcome all obstacles that crop up. Improve your chances by creating a practical plan and following it through to completion. Temper your passion for life with a healthy dose of humility."
virgo,2014-07-17,"You face an uphill battle now as you try to figure out why your recent plan went wrong. You may be struggling to unravel the complex factors playing out in the present moment, but it's apparent that you must make a mid-course correction or you won't reach your destination. Nevertheless, it's not wise to make changes too quickly. Overreacting is even less constructive than doing nothing at all. Don't waste time looking back to uncover your mistakes; instead, look ahead and plan for your future success."
libra,2014-07-17,"A conflict in a relationship creates additional stress today, especially if someone rebels against your plan for no apparent reason. A close friend or partner might surprise you by unexpectedly expressing a position that is radically different from yours. Although you may choose not to argue, just letting others do what they want isn't in your best interest either. Confronting small problems directly prevents them from growing into major ones later on."
scorpio,2014-07-17,"You are not satisfied by just doing good work today; you want others to acknowledge your brilliant contributions as well. Attacking an old project in a new and different way isn't enough of a diversion to hide your insecurity. But there's no need to put so much effort into seeking recognition, especially if your current desire for the spotlight allows you to forget that your initial purpose was to get the job done. Creating a detailed plan can be quite helpful, but micro managing every element might get in the way of your productivity."
sagittarius,2014-07-17,"It's nearly impossible to contain your exuberant self-expression today now that the enterprising Aries Moon is striking up the band in your 5th House of Spontaneity. However, your creative excitement may be too much to handle for those around you. Being less demonstrative is not a sensible solution, but it helps to give others time to show off their talents, too. Encouraging friends and co-workers to embark on an adventure with you might be more rewarding than just standing on the stage alone."
capricorn,2014-07-17,"You may be stepping into unfamiliar territory today as you struggle to balance your desire to be with those you love with your need to withdraw into your own world. Fortunately, you can play both extremes now. Keep your heart open while also mindfully setting boundaries and respecting the wishes of others. It doesn't matter if you're feeling uncomfortable because it's at these awkward spots that the real magic happens."
aquarius,2014-07-17,"You are an intense bundle of erratic thoughts today as familiar ideas combine to create new and ingenious plans. Luckily, you can showcase your talents without much effort, dazzling others with your brilliance. However, there is a huge difference between an adequate job and an awesome one. Putting extra time into your preparation pays off now, so don't take any unnecessary shortcuts just to impress anyone else. Your good intentions don't mean all that much unless you follow through with decisive action."
pisces,2014-07-17,It's scary to progress ahead so fast that you must scramble your way back to safe ground. There's no need to throw out your sensible plans now just because you momentarily lose track of where you're going. Risk-taking isn't necessary now; just slow down to a sustainable pace. Stick to your current path; don't let the increasing pressure trick you into reacting impulsively.
aries,2014-07-18,"Your dreams have grown so vivid that you want to tell everyone about them as soon as you wake up. Nevertheless, it may be wise to keep quiet today. There's nothing wrong with expressing what's on your mind or in your heart, but it's smart to wait for the best time. Remember, other people have stories they want to share, too, and your life could be enriched by hearing them. Practicing patience now strengthens your character and gives you a special opportunity to shine the spotlight on someone else."
taurus,2014-07-18,"You may believe that you know exactly what you want today, and are tempted to share your thoughts in great detail. You're just expressing your opinion, but others won't be able to hear your message if they think you're overstating your position. It's better to keep your words to a minimum now. You will have time later on to further expound on your ideas once the energy settles down and your audience is more willing to listen."
gemini,2014-07-18,"Your co-workers might seem a bit emotionally detached today, but they are likely to support your current efforts anyway. Nevertheless, you're not seeking comfort from them now; you want decisive action. You would currently prefer someone to just do anything, rather than idly talking about their plans. Plenty of words have already been spoken and it's time to push ahead. Don't wait for anyone else to make the first move; lead by example, instead."
cancer,2014-07-18,"You are determined to show your boss and your coworkers that you can take charge today, for it seems like lately they have drawn a different conclusion. Remember, you don't have to prove yourself to anyone. All you need to do is acknowledge what happens as you push past your self-doubt and do whatever needs to be done. Unfortunately, you are capable of being the biggest obstacle to your own success. Get out of your way and allow your intuition to safely guide you toward your future."
leo,2014-07-18,"You're sorely tempted to continue on your current mission without stopping to notice the details that might prevent you from being successful. However, it's not productive to get so entangled in fine-tuning your strategy that you end up doing nothing at all. Initiating action is more effective today if you don't blindly bolt ahead too fast. It makes more sense to simply sustain your efforts than to run around in circles. Taking time to do something right the first time is better than having to redo it later on."
virgo,2014-07-18,"You may be so excited about starting something new today that you grow anxious unless you're busy every moment. This nervous impatience isn't your normal style, but could be your natural way of overcompensating for the current uncertainty. Talk with your friends about any discomfort you're experiencing since acknowledging your ambition might help to alleviate your stress. But nothing positive is gained by totally reversing your methodical approach; gradual change is more likely to last."
libra,2014-07-18,"Even a casual conversation with a friend might feel like a disagreement today, although your desires don't necessarily conflict with one another. More likely, your tactics simply vary because of your individual creative styles. Instead of trying to agree on one correct way to accomplish your current goal, recognize the advantages of both strategies. It's more productive now to be inclusive than to be right."
scorpio,2014-07-18,"You don't want to be at odds with anyone, but might grow hot tempered now that the evocative Moon is stirring things up in feisty Aries. Nevertheless, you are likely wise enough to keep your emotions in check anyhow. Redirecting your pent-up energy into your work or channeling your angst into physical exercise helps you release the additional stress today. Although it's crucial to honor your feelings, it's still up to you to decide how and when to express them."
sagittarius,2014-07-18,"Don't worry if you can't rationalize your optimism today, for your positive attitude doesn't necessarily correspond to anything specific occurring in your life. Nevertheless, your thoughts have more power than usual, enabling you to impact your future by changing your attitude. Just be careful that you aren't avoiding an issue that must be faced sooner than later. Taking control of your life is a smart idea as long as you aren't trying to run from the truth."
capricorn,2014-07-18,"You may be entangled in the stresses of everyday life as you wonder how much to share about your ambitions. You can't help but worry that verbalizing your intentions will dissipate the energy and diminish your motivation. Nevertheless, you still want everyone to know what's important to you now. Pushing ahead without an explanation can be confusing to others, so take the time to make sure that your closest friends are kept in the loop."
aquarius,2014-07-18,"Although you can feel the pressure starting to build, you're still optimistic today as you navigate the changes at work. But it's crucial to pay attention to any unexpressed negativity that might be lurking in the shadows, even if you think you have everything under control. Unfortunately, keeping secrets now only adds to your troubles later. Consider taking someone into your confidence, because getting another perspective casts everything in a brand new light."
pisces,2014-07-18,"Swinging into action today might produce the positive impact that you seek, but you first must convince yourself that you are ready for this moment. You have inertia to overcome, and the longer you do nothing, the harder it is to get going. Your time is now; step up to the plate and show everyone what you can do. Trust your intuition and don't let the opportunity pass you by without making a concerted effort to hit a home run."
aries,2014-07-19,"You feel as if you're being pushed to defend your position today as your key planet Mars squares off with the willful Sun. Simultaneously, you are being cosmically coaxed to seek softer styles of expression. You might attempt to balance these opposite responses now, but without conscious intervention warrior Mars could win out. It's more important than ever to temper your sense of urgency with a kinder and gentler approach. Make love not war."
taurus,2014-07-19,"You may choose to disobey the rules today, but you really don't have to openly rebel to prove your point. Showing disrespect only adds more complications that you really don't need. Instead, lean on the harmonious aspects created by the Moon's presence in your sensible sign to find a more peaceful resolution to your current anger. Thinking outside of the box is essential now in order to put your brilliant plan into practice."
gemini,2014-07-19,"It's nearly impossible to think straight today and you're wise to postpone a significant decision if you can. But if you can't delay making your choice, at least don't try to fool yourself by believing that you're being objective. You may have already formed your opinion and new information won't likely change your position. However, keep in mind that impulsive reactions can be magnets for trouble. Whatever you decide, take additional time to consider all the options before giving your final answer."
cancer,2014-07-19,"It's out of character to wear your feelings on your sleeve but you may be unhappy about something at work, prompting you to discuss the matter with anyone who will listen. Proceed with caution, for your strong opinions might provoke others to react aggressively, beginning a cycle of conflict escalation. Defending your convictions is healthy, but it's really not necessary to turn a minor disagreement into a major battle. Taking the high road makes you a hero for the day."
leo,2014-07-19,"It's all too easy for your annoyance to boil over into anger if you don't stay one step ahead of your emotions today. You might believe that expressing dissatisfaction is the most responsible thing to do but unfortunately, you could take your position too far. Don't worry so much about self-disclosure. It's more important for others to see that you can get the job done right than it is for them to know your personal feelings. Set your grievances aside; ultimately, the only thing that really matters now is your performance."
virgo,2014-07-19,"Your self-reliance is admirable but you're still not free to just go off on your own. Other people are depending on you and you are committed to meeting your obligations, even if you believe you might be happier being on the move now. Don't let your frustration turn into anger or it may get the best of you. The choice is yours; you can blame someone else for the current situation or you can assume responsibility for your actions. Take control and start making improvements to create positive change in your life."
libra,2014-07-19,"A serious tone is settling over your life now, reminding you that patience will bring better results than an impulsive reaction. Your key planet Venus creates an anxious aspect to somber Saturn today, requiring you to demonstrate self-restraint when expressing your feelings. Staying aware of your changing moods enables you to maintain a healthy perspective. Losing your temper might feel satisfying in the moment, but doesn't necessarily help your cause in the long run."
scorpio,2014-07-19,"You could become so irritated with a friend or colleague today that you don't know how to express what's on your mind without losing your cool. You believe that your criticism is justified, but your intensity level may be too much for some people now that the Sun squares your key planet Mars. However, it isn't necessary to bury your feelings. Engaging in physical activity can help you move through this stress with grace. Another option is to confide in a close friend who understands your passionate nature. Finding an appropriate outlet for your energy saves the day."
sagittarius,2014-07-19,"Pushing others too hard today could be an exercise in futility. Instead of acting aggressively and stubbornly trying to get people to do things your way, just work on your own for a while. Don't bother drawing up complex plans and procedures; just jump in and figure it out on the fly. It's great if your friends offer to help, but don't rely on their assistance or you could end up waiting all day. Simply demonstrate your leadership skills by setting an example that everyone will want to follow."
capricorn,2014-07-19,"You may find yourself in an awkward predicament today if your current strategy lacks substance. You might have added lots of facts and figures to your plans to make them seem more concrete, but now you need to take an entirely new approach. Letting go of your frustration or any regrets about a missed opportunity is the first step to creating change. Re-evaluating your objectives and refining your tactics move you closer toward your goals. If you don't succeed at first, try, try again."
aquarius,2014-07-19,"You could find yourself in an uncomfortable position if others expect more from you than you can give now. You might have assumed that you would have more discretionary time available, but you don't seem to be able to handle the chaos if circumstances fly out of control. Losing your temper won't make any of your current problems disappear. Instead of lashing out at whoever is in your way, practice the art of patience by remembering that this, too, shall pass."
pisces,2014-07-19,"Layers of complexity might plague your personal relationships today, making it impossible to know which way to turn. In fact, it's easier to forget about the emotional dynamics so you can focus solely on fulfilling your responsibilities. Although it seems as if you're doing more than your share of the work, it's best to grin and bear it, rather than rocking the boat. Your emotions are amplified now, so wait a couple of days before you make your next move. In the meantime, channel your angst into your work."
aries,2014-07-20,"You might be worried that you missed your window of opportunity to handle a relationship issue now that yesterday's excitement has passed. However, rather than dwelling on what you should have done, focus on settling your energy and sustaining your progress. Don't get so caught up in your personal agenda that you forget to respect other people's limits. If you start to obsess about anything, see it as a sign to stop pushing so hard. If you take time today to integrate recent changes, success will come easier in the future."
taurus,2014-07-20,"You may feel so lazy now that you wish you could let the day slip by without getting much accomplished. Fortunately, the Moon's return to your pragmatic sign inspires you to simplify your life. Your senses are sharper today and your conclusions are logical, but you still might get into trouble by giving someone the benefit of the doubt. Everything is not always as good as it appears; processing negative feelings requires courage, but can also lead to better decision-making in the future."
gemini,2014-07-20,"Your witty words can make it seem as if you are fully engaged in connecting with others, but your clever repartee could also serve to hide your emotions. Although you may conclude that your limited disclosure is a wise strategy today, whatever you keep secret might have just as much impact as what you share. Instead of laughing off your vulnerability, take a deep breath and try to express what's actually in your heart."
cancer,2014-07-20,"Receiving solid support from your friends and family today goes a long way to bolster your confidence, but there could be unspoken demands that are intrinsically tied to their help. It feels as if there are powerful undertones to everything that happens now and you might be obliged to return a favor even if you never were told that was part of the deal. Don't let your annoyance turn into resentment; be upfront and express your reservations clearly from the start. Ultimately, your transparency works in everyone's favor."
leo,2014-07-20,"You struggle to rein in your exuberance today, but you could inadvertently offend someone if you don't curb your enthusiasm. You may be reveling in the adrenaline rush of taking a risk, yet it seems that expressing your desires isn't in your best interest now. Instead of assuming that you will get what you want, it's healthier to graciously accept the current circumstances without clinging to any additional expectations. Others will be more likely to support your dreams if you turn down your volume just a notch."
virgo,2014-07-20,"You're not eager to become overly involved in a friend's melodrama today, but you could be pulled into it anyhow. Thankfully, your listening skills are augmented by your cool objectivity. Maintaining a practical outlook is exactly what is needed now to smooth out everyone's ruffled feathers. Don't worry if you need to put your personal satisfaction on the back burner while you help out someone you love. Karma rewards positive actions in ways you don't always understand."
libra,2014-07-20,"Your closest friends may set a lovely example today by displaying their affection and respect for you. Unfortunately, everything isn't as perfect as it seems at first. Upon close scrutiny, you might notice unexpressed feelings lurking just beneath the surface, adding a sense of apprehension to your interactions. Don't let a minor miscommunication morph into a major meltdown. Requesting immediate clarification minimizes the chances of reading more into a situation than is actually there. Clearing the air gives everyone the chance to speak from the heart."
scorpio,2014-07-20,"You might think that sharing your current worries with a close friend today will assuage your fears. But the obstinate Taurus Moon in your 7th House of Relationships runs into an opposition to stern Saturn, revealing more complications than you expected. Even with the best of intentions, whatever you say now can precipitate an emotionally volatile conversation. Although you may regret expressing your feelings at first, the results will likely be extremely worthwhile for all parties involved if you stick with it."
sagittarius,2014-07-20,"You have a nuts-and-bolts approach to complex problems today and may truly believe that any situation can be resolved if you simply maintain a positive attitude. Fortunately, an unexpected conflict of interests won't likely create any long-term problems, even if it temporarily wreaks havoc on your stress levels. Rattled nerves should calm down pretty quickly if you don't feed them with fear. It doesn't matter if you can't establish common ground right away. It's more important to respect everyone's right to his or her own opinion and expect nothing less in return."
capricorn,2014-07-20,"It's not your choice to tackle an emotional issue that doesn't seem to have an immediate impact on your productivity. However, you might be receiving signals from your subconscious that warp your perceptions just enough to throw a conversation off course today. It's a smarter strategy to get to the source of a problem before it becomes even more complicated by your denial. Stay calm, cool and collected; others are counting on your practical approach to navigate through these tricky waters."
aquarius,2014-07-20,"A friend or family member may be extra nice to you, tempting you to lower your guard. Normally, you would be happy to comply, but he or she might be working with a hidden agenda today, making for a complicated interaction. Listen closely to what's not being said because the missing information holds more sway over your day than what's actually shared. In the meantime, don't let your fears isolate you from those you love. Strike a healthy balance by actively participating in the day's events while waiting for the rest of the story to surface."
pisces,2014-07-20,"Your methodical approach to your daily routine can make the difference between a frustrating day and one that brings deep satisfaction. However, you might feel as if other people are trying to  impede your progress. Unfortunately, if this is true, you may not have the chance to directly address the problem yet. Instead, of confronting anyone, continue to shine your light by taking the high road. The external resistance will eventually fade if you choose not to empower it with your own negativity."
aries,2014-07-21,"Your instincts tell you that something extraordinary is lurking just around the next bend in the road, but you must work diligently or it could disappear before you get there. Don't give up now when it's more important than ever to stretch beyond your normal limits; be prepared to do whatever it takes to overcome any obstacles you might encounter. Show the world what you can do if you put your mind on reaching the stars."
taurus,2014-07-21,"You might feel a strong need for comfort and familiarity, but you realize that taking the easy route isn't in your best interests now. Even if you want to hold on to a recent memory of an enjoyable experience, sustaining pleasure doesn't necessarily nurture your growth. Don't be complacent and fall back on old habits just to avoid your emotions. Take a risk and share your feelings if you sincerely want to improve a significant relationship."
gemini,2014-07-21,"Expect the unexpected when it comes to your schedule for the next few days. You might plan on some peace and quiet at work or at home, only to have surprise visitors arrive and disrupt your surroundings. There's no need to fight against having a day of discovery and maybe even meeting new people, since spontaneous socializing comes naturally to you. Happily, trying different experiences stimulates your mind and makes life more interesting. Enjoy the diversity while you have the chance."
cancer,2014-07-21,"Spending time with friends at work or play sounds like a wonderful idea today. However, you may start to internalize your feelings after the Moon shifts into your 12th House of Invisibility, making you less motivated to be a part of the group. Instead of slipping into your natural role as caretaker, turn your attention toward what makes you happy. Ironically, you will have more energy for nurturing everyone else once your needs are acknowledged. Dream a little dream, and then make it come true."
leo,2014-07-21,"Taking charge of a situation is easy when you know what to do, but being a real leader requires extra patience today. You can't be too ambitious or push others too far if you want them to follow you. Oddly enough, you have a better chance of success if you take yourself and the situation lightly. Ultimately, the heavy expectations weighing you down are probably your own. Give yourself a break; everyone else will probably be more forgiving than you think if your heart is in the right place."
virgo,2014-07-21,Step away from all the hectic noise today and escape your ordinary routine. Use your imagination to look out into the distance beyond the horizon and expand your vision by embarking on a journey of the mind. Philosophical discussions can open your eyes to radical new perspectives. Don't worry too much about the cost because there's no price that can be put on the wisdom of experience.
libra,2014-07-21,"You might have your heart set on deepening a significant relationship, but unrealistic expectations expand the bubble of your dreams until it pops. An unexpected turn of events spins the day in an awkward direction, but your flexibility prevents things from flying off track. For example, a stubborn partner may put a damper on your fun. But your own unwillingness to change now could be the real issue. Even if everything doesn't move along seamlessly, a little surprise could add a touch of spice to your love life."
scorpio,2014-07-21,"You may be able to finally stop working for a while and start enjoying the company of others. Put down your tools, kitchen utensils and keyboard; get out and connect with some real people who can make you laugh. Thankfully, an easygoing person helps to calm your anxieties. Indulging in basic pleasures is an excellent exercise in creating the healthy balance that you need at this time. Life can be simple if you simply let go and relax."
sagittarius,2014-07-21,Your feelings are being pulled all over the place today as the uncommitted Gemini Moon skips through your 7th House of Companions. Today's cosmic message is to take relationships slowly or you won't have anything to show for all your emotional turmoil. It might require gentle persuasion to convince your friend or partner that you mean business. Be flexible enough to recognize new channels of communication that can be of benefit both personally and professionally.
capricorn,2014-07-21,"One of the secrets of the zodiac is that although you Capricorns are known for working hard, you like to play hard, too. People often see you as so serious and ambitious that they underestimate your ability to have fun. Romance can certainly play a role in your activities these days, but don't fall into the trap of being too goal-oriented. Instead, take a day off from the need to accomplish anything. Living in the present moment enables you to return to your responsibilities with a fresh perspective on life."
aquarius,2014-07-21,"Traditional values amongst family members prompt you to keep some things to yourself today. It might be best to stop talking about your personal needs for now since people won't even notice you until they're ready, which isn't necessarily according to your schedule. Remember, successful communication requires paying attention to the mood of your audience and adjusting your message accordingly. When it comes to matters of the heart, timing is everything."
pisces,2014-07-21,"Your thoughts are exceptionally clear today and you're able to bring your colorful visions down to earth. Fortunately, conversations with sensible people help you locate the ground in which you can nurture the seeds of your powerful imagination. However, you may have to get cleverly creative to overcome any obstacles that crop up along the way. Staying positive about the big picture helps you work through any stress that arises when confronting the details. Whatever you do, don't stop believing in your dreams."
aries,2014-07-22,"Your perceptions may be crystal clear but you must limit the quantity of data you receive or you could change your mind every few minutes throughout the day. You are fascinated by new concepts and are eager to fully embrace them as yours. Rather than overreacting by jumping to the next good idea, choose one and take it as far as you can. E.E. Cummings wrote, ""I'd rather learn from one bird how to sing than to teach ten thousand stars how not to dance."""
taurus,2014-07-22,"There's nothing wrong with your logic today, but don't focus on the mistakes of others. Lead by example and do what you can to improve your own work, instead. However, a critical attitude by itself won't prompt you to make personal changes, for you are most likely to acquiesce when gently coaxed, rather than if you feel forced into action. You're more likely to succeed if you believe in what you're doing."
gemini,2014-07-22,"The pace of the past few days may have seemed a bit slow, but today's mentally active Gemini Moon continues a fresh energy cycle that inspires you with one idea after another. You could actually have too much on your plate, making it difficult to decide what to do next. It's best not to take on more than you can handle, but this means you must stop long enough to establish your priorities. Think first; act later."
cancer,2014-07-22,"You are some what agitated by your overactive imagination that could make prolonged concentration very challenging today. You can make the most of this creative buzz by finding a quiet place to unwind a bit. If possible, take some time away from your work now, but don't confuse needing solitude with being lazy. Let your mind travel where it chooses and you just might come up with a brilliant new idea that makes your escape seem worthwhile."
leo,2014-07-22,"You are feeling overly vulnerable today and words that would normally roll off your back may feel like an attack. Maintaining an objective perspective is a smart way to stay calm, for the situation is not likely as threatening as it seems. Although others may be in a playful mood, you might be missing the joke. Instead of letting your pride get in the way, stop taking everything so personally and join in the fun."
virgo,2014-07-22,"Casually contacting a friend could end up helping you professionally now. Even someone you barely know may be of assistance in ways you cannot yet comprehend. Today, your job isn't to criticize anything or anyone, but to simply open yourself up to the possibilities. There is more going on than meets the eye, so save your judgment until you better understand what others can contribute. You can't rush some things; trust develops on its own schedule."
libra,2014-07-22,"It's an excellent day to smooth out wrinkles in an existing relationship, even if very delicate diplomacy is required. The most crucial thing is to understand one another, especially in personal matters. Compassion is needed to keep a conversation going, so be kind with your tone while being truthful with your words. Balancing honesty with respect enables you to exchange points of view under the best possible conditions. Communication is a two-way street."
scorpio,2014-07-22,"Discussions may grow more serious today, yet your persistence allows you to resolve a sticky issue. Engaging in dialogue won't be enough, though; a bit of flexibility on both sides is necessary to grease the process. Just remember that if you think you know the answer, there are still other possible responses to consider. Don't dig in your heels for no reason; make adaptability your mantra and you'll come out a winner."
sagittarius,2014-07-22,"New worlds of possibilities are calling, but first you have a few practical matters to handle. Starting out by tackling the most ordinary tasks now can give you the freedom to enjoy yourself later. Don't worry if you're feeling restless because your boredom won't last long. Hurry up and finish your chores; there will be plenty of activity to keep you entertained before you know it."
capricorn,2014-07-22,"Your best-laid plans may begin to crumble under the pressure now as unexpected demands are put on your time and energy. Nevertheless, remember to give yourself a break as the pace of your daily life speeds up. Accepting that you can't complete everything today might be enough to change the dynamics and help you to relax. Paradoxically, doing only what is absolutely necessary might actually enable you to finish more, faster than you expect."
aquarius,2014-07-22,"Exploring a delightful variety of stimulating people, places and activities enriches your life in so many ways. You are happily entertained by little things as romantic energies begin to stir. Even a casual conversation can suddenly turn flirtatious today. But don't get too attached to any particular outcome; enjoy the innocence of living in the moment. Acting spontaneously adds a lovely element of surprise to your day."
pisces,2014-07-22,"Life is simpler these days if you have fewer family obligations, so don't complicate matters by making so many promises now that you fall behind on your commitments. Acting with confidence is healthy, but blind optimism is not. Even if everything appears to be under control for the moment, conditions can change unexpectedly. Avoid being caught off guard by consciously setting limits and sticking to them."
aries,2014-07-23,"Your confidence might have flagged during the past month, but change is in the air and things are beginning to improve. A noticeable shift in your attitude won't occur overnight, but you feel more positive day by day. Allow the current events to unfold without resistance while continuing to affirm that better times are on the way. Believing in yourself, coupled with the Sun's move into your 5th House of Creativity, is all it takes to chase away the clouds of self-doubt."
taurus,2014-07-23,"You are more in touch with your feelings while the Sun's presence in your 4th House of Roots lights up your walk down Memory Lane. However, you could be hijacked by your past if you're not careful. Don't bother trying to hold onto childhood perspectives any more, especially if they reinforce your concerns about scarcity. Remember, the universe is overflowing with unlimited possibilities, so show up with a smile and do what you can to transform your fears into love."
gemini,2014-07-23,"A wave of insecurity might cause you to overcompensate and show only your very best side today. But your positive attitude could come across as false if you sound blindly optimistic. It's of no value to hide the truth now, even if it's not what you think someone else wants to hear. Don't get bent out of shape over the wrong things; stick to the facts and let others take responsibility for their reactions. The only person within your control is you."
cancer,2014-07-23,"You might feel a surprising sense of relief as the relentless Sun leaves your sign. You're no longer in the spotlight, allowing you to work more quietly behind the scenes. But you might not want to withdraw into your shell for too long because the Moon slips into your 11th House of Social Networking tonight. You wish you could just make up your mind but you're being pulled in two totally different directions. Instead of buying into the illusion that you must make a choice, you will be happier if you just go with the flow."
leo,2014-07-23,"You're in your own element today; you have a specific agenda and nothing will stand between you and your destination. There's only one problem with believing you're invincible: you're not. You might run into danger if you try to outsmart reality. Luckily, your wildest dreams are within reach as long as you have enough flexibility to respond to the changing conditions of the road. The power of positive thinking works in your favor, but you can't rush success."
virgo,2014-07-23,"You aren't a happy camper if you discover someone is keeping pertinent information from you today but, thankfully, you are able to efficiently handle the situation. Even a difficult experience can quickly morph into a positive one if you exude confidence, rather than doubt. The willful Sun and opinionated Jupiter are both traveling through your 12th House of Secrets; change the game now by preemptively exploring the hidden realms of your subconscious. Happiness comes from the clues you find buried deep in the shadows."
libra,2014-07-23,"You want to keep up with your friends because they appear to be having more than their fair share of fun. Even at work, your associates don't seem to be working very hard today. The good news is your productivity won't necessarily suffer if you join in the social festivities now. Luckily, the brilliant Sun's shift into your 11th House of Long-Term Goals enables you to find pleasure in the present moment while also keeping an eye on the future."
scorpio,2014-07-23,"It's disconcerting if someone assumes that you will always drop your personal priorities when asked. You wouldn't mind offering your assistance out of the goodness of your heart, but you don't appreciate the pressure of being told what to do. There's no need to say yes and jump right in. Believe it or not, others will get by without you immediately rushing to their rescue today. Considering all your options before responding may be enough of a cue to convey that you don't want anyone to take advantage of your generosity."
sagittarius,2014-07-23,"Perhaps you're busy dreaming about unrealistic scenarios to avoid dealing with the promises you already made. Your intentions may have been sincere in the moment, but your time is running short and you don't know how you're going to fulfill all of your obligations now. Keep in mind that even a minor task could grow into a major one today. Don't make any sudden changes to your overall strategy yet; wait a few days to see how the new landscape takes shape and then re-establish a fresh set of priorities. Your future is bright as long as your energy isn't spread too thin."
capricorn,2014-07-23,"Even the most surefooted of you goats can slip if you're moving too fast, and an overabundance of bravado today might be enough to make you careless. Believing in dreams is crucial, but overconfidence could cause more harm than good. Don't give reality a reason to teach you a lesson in humility. You have a better chance of reaching your ambitious goals if you focus on each step along the way. Slow and steady wins the race."
aquarius,2014-07-23,"Everyone you know is playing a part in your movie now that the dramatic Leo Sun is holding court in your 7th House of Others. Unfortunately, you may be growing weary of someone's self-promoting behavior. You crave sincerity and truthfulness, but could feel as if you're currently being shortchanged in your relationships. It will be a lot less stressful if you accept the fact that others are probably giving all that they can. Instead of wishing for more, be appreciative of what you have today."
pisces,2014-07-23,"You would like to have more free time at your disposal today, but you may have already overcommitted yourself in the chores department. Running errands and helping others prevent you from following your fantasies. But don't complain about your obligations; just doggedly finish what you can with a smile in your heart. Thankfully, if you apply yourself diligently during the day, you should have time for more pleasurable pursuits in the evening."
aries,2014-07-24,"Words roll off your tongue so easily today that you could create trouble before you know it. In fact, you might have so much to say that it sounds like your feelings have been brewing beneath the surface for too long. But even if you haven't been holding back, you're ready to throw caution to the wind now. Staying aware of the ramifications of your message saves you from complicating the situation further. Don't dwell on the past; instead, let your forgiveness work its magic so you can move ahead with a clean slate."
taurus,2014-07-24,"You aren't happy if someone opposes your plan, yet it's challenging to compromise if your stubbornness gets in the way. You may believe you're acting graciously now, but you might irritate others with your attempts to gloss over difficulties. Thankfully, you have a chance to do something special that can have a positive impact on those closest to you. Decide what is more important -- accomplishing your goals or nurturing your loved ones. Taking the road less traveled requires courage and sacrifice, but the rewards are worth it."
gemini,2014-07-24,"Your agile mind may already be planning multiple escape routes. However, you might not seek out direct confrontation when push comes to shove, unless you do it in the spirit of playful banter. However, unspoken emotional issues can overwhelm your desire to be lighthearted. It doesn't matter now how well-meaning your intentions are until you find a way to exercise your limited powers of self-restraint. Thankfully, your positive attitude is contagious if you listen as much as you talk. A constructive dialogue clears the air and gives everyone a chance to speak their piece."
cancer,2014-07-24,"Exercising caution is wise because the hypersensitive Cancer Moon might stir up plenty of emotional turmoil today. Thankfully, your self-confidence can quiet your insecurities, even if you end up revealing more than you initially intended. Thinking twice before spilling the beans prevents a sticky situation. However, if you say nothing at all, your hurt could easily turn to resentment. Don't give up while searching for that elusive middle path between transparency and secrecy; your relationships will benefit from your persistence."
leo,2014-07-24,"Your imagination may be too active for your own good today; you could annoy your coworkers by cutting them off before they complete their thoughts. They might think you are hungry for attention and can't stand to share the spotlight. However, from your perspective, it's just a matter of expediency. A Sun-Jupiter conjunction in your sign fills you with bravado, prompting you to push harder to accomplish your objectives. Paradoxically, giving others an opportunity to shine ultimately improves your chances of reaching your destination."
virgo,2014-07-24,"Your goals may be so altruistic now that you begin to wonder if you are fooling yourself. It's one thing to strive to positively impact the world, but quite another if you grow resentful because your personal life is neglected. Don't wait until your good intentions turn sour; balance your spiritual pursuits with your practical needs. When service to others is tempered by common sense, there's no limit to what you can accomplish."
libra,2014-07-24,"Although your friends might seem pleasant enough today, something is still bothering you about their actions. Unfortunately, the more you think about their behavior the crankier you become; nevertheless, you won't likely get what you want by blowing your top. Instead, work off your pent-up tension by buzzing around like a bee in a garden. Thankfully, putting integrity back into your relationships only requires a decision on your part to change your attitude. You don't have to be a victim of your worries. Take the high road and choose love over fear."
scorpio,2014-07-24,"Your career is on the launch pad now that the Sun is hooking up with Jupiter in your 10th House of Public Life. Nevertheless, you might still have some reservations about taking the next step on your ladder to success. Fortunately, you can play both ends of the spectrum today. Honor your intuition, even if it's telling you to wait before making your move. However, in the meantime, clearly state your intentions to the universe without holding back. Time is on your side."
sagittarius,2014-07-24,"Grandiose visions about an upcoming adventure can capture your imagination today. Your mind is moving fast -- so fast that you may not even finish one thought before you're on to the next one. Others might criticize you for your sloppy thinking, but it's your loss if you respond in anger. Instead of posturing to defend your ideas, use the feedback you receive to help sharpen your plans. Rolling with the incoming waves is almost always a smarter strategy than fighting against them."
capricorn,2014-07-24,"You might bring important information out into the open, but the positive effects of what you say can be lost if you don't know when to stop. You could be angry at someone today, yet you don't want to hurt his or her feelings just for the sake of revenge. Be as fair as you can while speaking directly from your heart -- and not your head. Equanimity increases your chances for finding a peaceful resolution."
aquarius,2014-07-24,"This is a rather strange time for you as a tug-of-war develops between your inner needs and your outer expressions. Others may encourage you to take a risk because they truly believe in you. But don't do anything rash because expressing your unrestrained emotions can create more problems now than they solve. Instead of reacting impulsively now, place additional room between an external stimulus and your response. A quick dash to the finish line sounds wonderful, but you're more likely to be a winner if you set a sustainable pace."
pisces,2014-07-24,"An unexpected change of plans may turn your world upside down today. If you are unsure of what to do next, acknowledge your culpability in the present circumstances instead of denying it. Remember, theoretically, nothing happens to you; reality unfolds with your assistance. Even if you feel temporarily overwhelmed, don't move too fast. Keep the faith; you have the ability to overcome nearly any odds now with lucky Jupiter on your side."
aries,2014-07-25,"Taking a sentimental journey through your memories might sound like a good idea today, but it could open a can of worms before you know it. Recollections of your youth may be spiritually uplifting until you remember something that also brings hurt feelings into the present moment. If you become stuck on anger or resentment, the best way to move forward is to shake off the past by starting a project that requires your total concentration. Redirecting your energy into something creative is the fastest route to bringing your focus back to the here and now."
taurus,2014-07-25,"You might try a strategy of passive resistance today if someone at work makes unreasonable demands on your time. You're not interested in wasting your energy arguing with anyone or explaining why you believe people are out of line. Instead, you opt to display your infamous bullheadedness because you assume that actions will speak louder than words. Nevertheless, others won't correct their errant ways unless you take the time to give them constructive criticism. Just make sure you treat everyone with the same respect you expect in return."
gemini,2014-07-25,"You often make spur-of-the-moment decisions to spend money on something that you want. However, you're more serious about your financial situation now that the retentive Cancer Moon is visiting your 2nd House of Possessions. It may be a prudent idea to say no to an unnecessary purchase today, but don't take your frugality so far that you pass up a really great bargain or a promising opportunity. Considering all your options from a practical perspective helps you to make a fiscally wise choice that continues to feel good into the future."
cancer,2014-07-25,"One moment you're enthusiastic and eager to take on your day with confidence. However, the next moment you may be complaining about how much work you have on your plate. Ironically, your moodiness could annoy everyone else more than it bothers you today. Thankfully, it's easy to prevent negativity from recycling back to you. Take some time to recharge your emotional batteries without blaming anyone else for your current need for a break. As long as you fulfill your obligations as promised, no one will fault you for your choice."
leo,2014-07-25,"The spotlight may continue to shine on you as the radiant Sun and boisterous Jupiter travel through your performance-oriented sign. But now the emotionally defensive Cancer Moon is hiding out in your 12th House of Escapism, tempting you to search for the nearest exit. Although you normally love the idea of performing on stage, today you value your privacy even more. Whether or not your heart is in it, you Lions know better than anyone that the show must go on."
virgo,2014-07-25,"You really don't want to disappoint your workmates, but they may be expecting so much from you these days that you begin to worry. Nevertheless, a dash of self-doubt can be therapeutic if it motivates you to do the necessary research to prepare for your job. However, your fear of failure is problematic if it prevents you from doing anything at all. Keep in mind that you are your own biggest critic and it's nearly impossible to satisfy your standards of excellence. Setting more realistic goals enables you to feel positive about your accomplishments."
libra,2014-07-25,"You may be more responsive to your associates at work than you are to a friend or lover, setting the stage for a possible relationship meltdown today. The Moon's visit to your 10th House of Profession reflects your current drive for success, but you could be so eager to get ahead that you end up paying an emotional price. Thankfully, remaining aware of your ambitions allows you to step back and find your center before you lose your balance."
scorpio,2014-07-25,"You could feel uncomfortably restrained today by the same set of circumstances and responsibilities that seemed just fine a few days ago. Part of your current problem is the strong wanderlust you are feeling now that the Moon is traveling through your 9th House of Adventure. Overcome your current inclination to let an opportunity pass because you have so much to do at home. If you are offered a chance to get out of town, take it. You can always finish up leftover chores when you return. You only live once."
sagittarius,2014-07-25,"Interpersonal interactions take on an air of intensity now that the Moon is swimming through the waters of your 8th House of Intimacy. Oddly enough, you aren't as interested in clever conversations that explore the far reaches of the cosmos as you are in getting to the bottom of your feelings. But emotional clarity isn't the only thing you need today; you also want to create a magical moment with someone special. With the right person, you could turn an ordinary day into a memorable one."
capricorn,2014-07-25,"Even an easy going relationship might seem fraught with emotional tension today with the sensitive Cancer Moon's presence in your 7th House of Others. You're willing to express your feelings now, without even realizing that your openness increases your vulnerability. Unfortunately, your fear of losing control can be triggered if you're pulled too far off track by an intense interaction. Don't walk away from this chance to connect. Rather than shutting down your heart, see what you can learn by exploring unfamiliar ground."
aquarius,2014-07-25,"You wish you could set aside your emotional needs today so you can focus on the logistics of your everyday life. Although the Moon's visit to your 6th House of Daily Routine encourages you to ignore your passions, denial isn't a viable strategy. Push up against your discomfort by openly expressing your desires, even if it means taking a risk. Happily, you might be pleasantly surprised when you discover that others support your unconventional pursuits."
pisces,2014-07-25,"Expressing your needs to someone you trust deepens a current friendship or sets the stage for a new romance as the reflective Moon moves through your 5th House of Love. Don't pull away from displaying your tenderness because you feel more alive when you're busy nurturing others. Nevertheless, it's crucial to maintain a clear perspective on your emotions, or you could become more attached than you planned. Make sure your intentions are clear before the waters get too deep."
aries,2014-07-26,"You feel free to be yourself today without worrying about receiving approval from anyone else. You don't want to suppress your creative process with the Leo New Moon stimulating your 5th House of Spontaneity. If you have been anticipating changing directions, strike while the iron is hot and approach everything you do with a playful attitude now. If you aren't having a good time, perhaps you should improve your attitude or try your hand at something else."
taurus,2014-07-26,"You may be building your domain on shifting sands as today's dynamic Leo New Moon rattles your 4th House of Roots. Although the exuberant Jupiter connection enables you to display an air of confidence, you might not feel as secure as you appear. Even if your close friends and family usually support your efforts, issues come to light now that have you wondering if you can truly count on them. Although honest dialogue is enlightening, your truth must come from within."
gemini,2014-07-26,"Your schedule might end up being an albatross around your neck today if you attempt to fit too much into one day. The universe is sending you private messages, reminding you to slow down and smell the roses. The expressive Leo New Moon illuminates your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, intensifying your interactions with those closest to you. If a seemingly innocuous event turns into a more serious problem, don't feed the drama with additional negativity of your own. Happily, your positive input can inspire others to see things in a better light."
cancer,2014-07-26,"You might have to change how you manage your money since today's Leo New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Personal Resources. You may be spending your cash under the illusion that you have more than you actually do. But you should consider your overall relationship to your current possessions and whatever else you want in your future. As you already know, material wealth is not the true source of happiness; concentrate your efforts on what really matters in the long run."
leo,2014-07-26,"It's a perfect day to create a fresh list of goals because today's proud Leo New Moon celebrates a new beginning in your life. But just writing your wishes down on paper won't have the positive impact you desire because it is the act of focusing your intentions that sets your life into motion. Once you visualize whatever you want in your mind's eye, commit to be unrelenting in reaching your objectives. The sky is the limit if you're willing to put in the time and effort to make your dreams come true."
virgo,2014-07-26,"You have arrived at a crossroads where your intuition is telling you one thing, but the facts are telling you something else. You might be able to rationalize your behavior now, even if it is different from what you logically know is best. But this Leo New Moon's presence in your 12th House of Destiny prompts a spiritual crisis as you try to align your actions with your beliefs. Don't worry if others can't understand your emotional dilemma today. Follow your dreams wherever they lead."
libra,2014-07-26,"Your social calendar could fall apart at the last minute with today's Leo New Moon landing in your 11th House of Networking. But rather than taking a disruption personally, it's wiser to realize that some things are simply beyond your control. The drama of the day could run you through a gamut of emotions. But don't overreact and rush to put everything back together yet. Uncertainty is in the air, so avoid drawing any final conclusions until the dust settles. Flexibility is your friend."
scorpio,2014-07-26,"Voluntarily keeping a secret is one thing, but being pressured to remain silent is entirely different. Today's showy Leo New Moon zaps your 10th House of Public Life, making it nearly impossible to hide your feelings for long. However, there's no justification for blame or mean-spirited behavior. Instant karma will get you as unnecessary negativity is reflected back to you faster than you expect. Go ahead and say whatever needs to be said, but be soft-spoken and kind in your delivery."
sagittarius,2014-07-26,"You may feel like celebrating today rather than tackling your chores yet, ironically, you could increase your chances for finding pleasure by meeting your responsibilities first. It's not that you can't have a good time with the audacious Leo New Moon activating your 9th House of Adventure. But extravagance might get in your way, especially if you want to prove something to someone else. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a playful approach, but everyone will have more fun if you avoid competition."
capricorn,2014-07-26,"Trouble surfaces in an intimate relationship today if anyone is anything less than fully honest. The theatrical Leo New Moon emphasizes your 8th House of Deep Sharing, making it tough to hide any secret agendas. Relationship dynamics may be stressed when unspoken resentments or buried jealousies see the light of day. However, the temporary emotional discomfort is worth it if getting things out in the open makes everyone feel better in the long run."
aquarius,2014-07-26,"You may be surprised by an energetic shift in your business and personal relationships as today's lively Leo New Moon triggers your 7th House of Partners. Unfortunately, your resistance to change can fuel a heated discussion. But your disagreement is actually with yourself -- even if someone else appears to be involved. Nevertheless, exploring your inner conflict enables you to embrace the unknown rather than clinging to the status quo."
pisces,2014-07-26,"You really want to put your life in order, but you are being pulled in opposing directions today. The Leo New Moon's presence in your 6th House of Daily Routine urges you to suppress your emotions so you can efficiently handle your obligations. But the heart-centered Leo Sun encourages you to playfully express your inner child. Avoid your current tendency to slip into denial because your feelings seem out of place. It's healthier to keep your passions close to the surface, even if you don't yet see how they will eventually fit into the bigger picture."
aries,2014-07-27,"Your creative approach to life colors all that you do as you seek ways to share your unique outlook. However, your imagination is so vivid now that it's challenging to verbalize your ideas. You might even choose to remain quiet since you currently think silence speaks louder than words. Nevertheless, an emotional retreat is self-defeating. The only way to resolve the tension between your inner and outer worlds is to bridge the gap through dialogue. There are no quick solutions; continue to reach out until you see a light at the end of the tunnel."
taurus,2014-07-27,"A powerful emotional storm may be brewing on the horizon yet it's hard to put your finger on the source of the disturbance today. Rather than obsessing over something you don't understand, take care of your immediate responsibilities. Be as practical as possible when mapping out your schedule, especially if you have deadlines looming. Although it's difficult to prioritize which tasks should come first, pay attention to the ones that have the most impact in the present moment."
gemini,2014-07-27,"If you are overwhelmed by a relationship dilemma these days, you might seek respite by burying yourself in work. You may even take on additional obligations just so you don't have to deal with your emotions. Nevertheless, avoidance isn't the answer; a gentle confrontation today can achieve better results. It's not necessary to overcome all obstacles at once as long as you acknowledge whatever is holding you back. Simply being honest helps more than you think."
cancer,2014-07-27,"Your current need for excitement places additional stress on a relationship. You might even feel as if the expectations of someone close to you are keeping you from expressing your feelings. You could grow disillusioned if you slip into denial to avoid upsetting the status quo. But hiding your frustration does more harm than good. Thankfully, initiating action grows easier over time. Make a practical plan now that enables you to explore your creative pursuits and still honor your obligations."
leo,2014-07-27,"You might think that you should be at the top of your game with all the planetary action in your sign now, but you need more than just the promise of a good time to set things right. The intensity level may be too much to handle today, even for you drama-loving Lions. Give meditation or prayer a chance to help you maintain a positive attitude. But don't sit still for too long; anything that gets your physical energy moving will also help to calm your nerves."
virgo,2014-07-27,"You could question everything that you do today, especially if your activities don't resonate with your heart. However, you may have chores to finish before you can take some time to contemplate your destiny. No matter how far along you are on your spiritual journey, you still have much to learn about yourself. There is no reason to waste energy  feeding your doubts. Whatever you do, don't ignore your inner voice now. Let your intuition be your guide."
libra,2014-07-27,"You may be required to stand up for what you want today. No one ever said that making your way in the world would be easy, especially if your personal views get tangled up with the truth. Don't confuse your values with facts or people might question your motives. It's best to take your intuition seriously now without losing touch with your common sense. Others can't blame you for speaking from your heart if you allow them to do the same."
scorpio,2014-07-27,"You can't deny your passionate nature now that your key planet Pluto is activating your desires. Meanwhile, dynamic Mars is back home in your sign, causing the emotional fires to burn even hotter. Thankfully, your good intentions, unflappable will and unrelenting strength empower you to perform profound magic and overcome all odds. There's no time to waste; ironically, everyone benefits from your personal transformation."
sagittarius,2014-07-27,"Unexpressed resentment can rear its ugly head today, motivating you to come across with more intensity than you actually feel. In fact, someone might see you as a threat, so it's to your advantage to keep things calm. On the other hand, your magnetism is electric so there may be pleasant fireworks in the love arena. Nevertheless, your current situation isn't ideal. Rather than trying to resolve any dilemmas now, living within the paradox leads to its own version of happiness."
capricorn,2014-07-27,"You have an uncanny knack for knowing exactly how hard to push forward and how much to hold back. It's tricky to live by this innate common sense now, but it's crucial to do so, nonetheless. These are strange times that benefit from your strategic calculations rather than spontaneous actions. Don't be afraid to temporarily drop your anchor wherever you are today so you won't veer too far off course. Exploring new territory is more productive when you don't get lost."
aquarius,2014-07-27,"You may be slightly uncomfortable with the intense passion you're feeling today. Logically, you realize it would be wise to suppress your wild desires because your resources are already stretched to the maximum. Although fulfilling your responsibilities might slow you down now, they won't hold you back for long. Set your sights high and don't be afraid to invest in your dreams."
pisces,2014-07-27,"Unspoken desires are inextricably linked to issues of power today. You may have the urge to act impulsively to show your strength, but your behavior might be driven by unconscious motives now. Unfortunately, if you deny your emotions, they can escape when you least expect it. But if you express your feelings too casually, you could find yourself in over your head. Move slowly and deliberately; you have more time than you realize to share your heart."
aries,2014-07-28,"There aren't any shades of gray in your life today. If you want someone or something, your feelings may grow so intense that you act foolishly. Luckily, you can avoid causing problems if you wait a few days before doing anything you will later regret. But keep in mind this is not about suppressing inconvenient emotions; you can be aware of your own passions without necessarily being ruled by them. Being cognizant of your reactions is mandatory; sharing them is optional."
taurus,2014-07-28,"Even if you think you know what you want to say today, you may need to reconsider your strategy. Contrary to common sense, the more intense your desires are now, the easier it is to rationalize doing nothing. Take your time when deciding what to express. But once your mind is made up, push yourself forward to initiate action. Trust the process; there's no reason to delay just because you are uncertain about the outcome. Nothing ventured; nothing gained."
gemini,2014-07-28,"Someone who has your feelings tied up in knots may become the focal point of a major problem today. Fortunately, you're clever enough to turn a complicated set of circumstances into a memorable time for all involved. Transform yourself from a victim into a hero as you deftly escape from other people's controlling behavior. Remember, the spotlight is on you now and you're not responsible to play a supporting role in anyone else's show."
cancer,2014-07-28,"You bring more to the table than people realize today, yet it's challenging to make others aware of your skills. A sensible place to start is by assessing your strengths and weaknesses, so you know how much you have to offer. Unfortunately, your current annoyance may turn into resentment if you're not appreciated by your peers. Nevertheless, it's not wise to openly express negativity now, unless it leads you directly to satisfaction."
leo,2014-07-28,"You can't see any valid reason to share your worries today, even if you have been hurt by someone you love. You are likely to hide your vulnerability because you don't want to give too much of your power away. Your self-esteem depends on being in control of your own emotions now, so don't allow anyone to talk you into disclosing your secrets before you are ready. Even the liveliest Leos need some time alone to think."
virgo,2014-07-28,"Even if you are trying to maintain an easy going attitude about your love life, you could be feeling very judgmental now. You're riding a powerful emotional wave and may not have a lot of control over your intense feelings. At first, you're not interested in retelling stories from your past just to make your point about a current situation. But you might grow bored and be tempted to shake things up, anyhow. Nevertheless, taking a slow and steady approach is better than upsetting the proverbial apple cart."
libra,2014-07-28,"You can often appear friendly and gracious as you make people feel at ease. But you might not be in the mood to play host to someone you aren't emotionally connected to now. Meanwhile, you could even grow irritable if your needs aren't being met today. Unfortunately, losing your temper doesn't serve any purpose at all. Instead, consciously choose to let go of any lingering negativity. Once you decide to widen your perspective, it's much easier to prepare for what's around the next corner."
scorpio,2014-07-28,"You must complete your current assignments before you can move on to what is next, but you wish you were already finished. Unfortunately, there might still be more work to do today and your resistance only prolongs the stress. Thankfully, action-planet Mars is now visiting your sign, signaling you to get busy while you have the time and energy. Don't wait; just do it now while you have the cosmic warrior on your side."
sagittarius,2014-07-28,"Obligations are stacking up and you need a break before jumping back into the fray. Unfortunately, you may not get the rest and relaxation you want because you carry your workload with you wherever you go now. It's tempting to project your frustrations onto others instead of taking responsibility for your problems. Before getting involved in an unnecessary conflict, remember that the current tension will likely disperse in the next few days on its own. However, you can do your part by seeking a solution instead of a scapegoat."
capricorn,2014-07-28,"It's all about relationships today and you might feel as if you can't win, no matter what you do. Sweet Venus is currently moving through your 7th House of Partnerships, temping you with sensual possibilities. But the Goddess of Love must stand up to powerful Pluto in a cosmic tug-of-war inspiring you to do battle. Unfortunately, engaging in conflict now means there won't be any winners. There's no need to make anyone uncomfortable with an emotional display. Instead, keep your intentions clear and continue to follow your bliss."
aquarius,2014-07-28,"An intense discussion about relationship issues could quickly turn to a more substantial debate that touches complex topics such as the meaning of love and life. However, you're not particularly interested in endless conversations about hypothetical situations and spiritual pursuits. You want to focus on the nuts and bolts today. Paradoxically, the mundane and the ethereal are somehow linked now and you can't talk about one without the other."
pisces,2014-07-28,"You are tired of fighting with those who always seem to resist you. The pressure continues to build today, as your boss or someone else who claims to be in charge puts stop signs in your path. But don't throw in the towel and walk away; you have more options in than you think. Remember to choose your battles carefully now, for your perceptions may be slightly bent out of shape. Don't lose hope; your positive persistence wins out in the end."
aries,2014-07-29,"You may expend an excessive amount of mental energy these days thinking about relationships. But even if you acknowledge that burying your feelings isn't healthy, it's still tempting to slip into denial. Don't worry about what might happen if you lose control; using logic to distance yourself from your emotions doesn't help now. There's nothing to be gained by attaching rational thoughts to irrational desires, so don't complicate matters with unnecessary expectations. When it comes to matters of love, don't second guess your heart."
taurus,2014-07-29,"Thankfully, your resistance to working with others settles into the background today, allowing you to be more comfortable in nearly any situation. Tackle a creative project now, even if it doesn't have a specific purpose yet. The process of undertaking something for your own enjoyment might unlock other more practical possibilities to pursue. Following your bliss is especially awesome if you enjoy the journey along the way."
gemini,2014-07-29,"You're searching for clarity about how to reach your long-term goals. Your emotions may seem erratic, yet standing on the edge of your future is the most exciting thing imaginable now. You're re-evaluating your priorities and seeking ways to integrate your personal desires into the larger circumstances of your life. However, you have ruminated on everything long enough. It's time to make your dreams come true; taking a risk isn't as risky as you think."
cancer,2014-07-29,"Although everything may appear very still and quiet today, you instinctively know when a storm is on the way. You can feel it in every cell of your body. Something big is brewing now and you're not fooled by the apparent calm. Stay cool and collected as you approach pockets of emotional turbulence. Thankfully, your uneasy anticipation will be alleviated once your needs and fears are addressed. Having a heart-to-heart talk with one of your close friends supplies you with all the support you need."
leo,2014-07-29,"You might believe that it's now-or-never as you sort through your options for the future. It feels as if you must do something quickly or the window of opportunity will begin to close. However, there's no need to panic now that auspicious Jupiter is camping out in your sign for a whole year. Nevertheless, the months will race by quicker than you can imagine, so make up your mind and put your plan into action. Let your confidence, not your fear, lead the way."
virgo,2014-07-29,"You have work to finish today, and if you can stick to your current course you should be ready to react to a whole new set of circumstances. Find clarity within your own mind before trying to impose your position on the rest of the world. Narrowing your range of vision helps you to follow your agenda. Take plenty of time to figure out what matters most to your heart. When your priorities are in order, everything else will fall into place."
libra,2014-07-29,"You have plenty to keep you busy, especially if you are facing a deadline. It doesn't matter if it's imposed by outside circumstances or by your own desire for completion; either way, it's crucial to stay on track today. These past few months have been rather hectic, but now it's time to focus your intentions and apply your talents to the work right in front of you. Don't waste your energy worrying about the future; concentrating on the present moment gives you a better return on your investment."
scorpio,2014-07-29,"Your long-term goals become more grounded now that the emotional Moon has shifted into earthy Virgo. Instinctively, you understand that your dreams co-create your future. This is very serious work, so don't waste your time on unrealistic illusions that have no possibility of fulfillment. Even if you think you know your limits, don't let them hold you back from having an extraordinary life."
sagittarius,2014-07-29,"Circumstances pull your thoughts and feelings back down to earth today. You are needed by others at work and at home, so your own personal agenda may have to be placed on the back burner for a while. Nevertheless, you still harbor deep feelings that are driving you to make your life more meaningful. There's no reason to be satisfied with the status quo no matter what obligations you still have to fulfill. Dream big and reach for the stars."
capricorn,2014-07-29,"Your brain is buzzing with exciting ideas today, making it nearly impossible to focus on your work. But don't fall back into your safe patterns as the Moon shuffles her way through industrious Virgo. Instead of trying to limit your expression by settling into familiar routines, be experimental and try a radical new approach. Even if it takes longer to finish a task, it's more interesting to travel the scenic route and explore alternative options along the way."
aquarius,2014-07-29,"Even if you choose to work on a project on your own today, someone could play an important role in your day, nevertheless. Needless to say, this might be frustrating since you may be required to make compromises to earn the support of others. Although you dislike engaging in social games to gain favors, you can turn things around by simply changing your attitude. Instead of displaying your irritation, express your gratitude and see where it leads. Approaching the situation with an open mind makes all the difference in the world."
pisces,2014-07-29,"You might believe that you're falling down on the job when it comes to relationships, especially if others are overly critical of your behavior today. However, someone's harsh judgment may reveal more about his or her insecurities than about your actions. Don't view this as a personal attack; instead of reacting defensively, listen to what's being said and use it as a catalyst for improving your performance. The best way to demonstrate your commitment is to take your game to a higher level."
aries,2014-07-30,"You might wake up with the best of intentions, determined to finish your current projects before starting anything new. This may be an all-too-familiar dilemma, especially when you reach the end of the day with chores still incomplete. Luckily, today offers you an opportunity to break the cycle and reap rewards if you simply remain focused on completing your tasks. If you leave work undone, it will only be harder to deal with tomorrow. Manage your inclination to give in to distractions by making a list and sticking to it."
taurus,2014-07-30,"Carefully considered speculations can pay off handsomely now, but you are wise to do your homework before making an investment or beginning a new project. However, once you decide your next step, you will ultimately progress along faster if you loosen up and enjoy yourself - even while diligently working to achieve your ambitious goals. Adopting a playful spirit enhances your spontaneity and creativity. Your positive attitude alone may be enough to persuade others to join in your fun."
gemini,2014-07-30,"You may be presented with an exciting opportunity to demonstrate your flexibility. Fortunately, you can successfully pursue a course of action now even if your heart isn't fully in it. Keep things in perspective since there's no need to waste energy trying to change something that's beyond your control. Your point of view is evolving so remain open and continue to integrate your creative vision into everyday life. Your positive attitude is an inspiration to others."
cancer,2014-07-30,"Be thoughtful about which words you use today. You might inadvertently draw ire from someone who doesn't normally express much emotion. Most likely, this misunderstanding won't blow up into a significant conflict. It's challenging to back down gracefully once the ego is involved, but taking the high road demonstrates your strength of character. An honest act of goodwill can be the surest way to cultivate peace and harmony."
leo,2014-07-30,"Managing your finances is complicated now because conflicting information comes to light as you dig deeper into the details. Although you might not have enough time to untangle everything today, delving out the truth can avert a larger crisis. There's no need to overreact or you could just make things worse. Stay calm, cool and collected while focusing on the solution rather than the problem. Your creative brilliance will win out in the end."
virgo,2014-07-30,"Find a way to express your disappointment today before it transforms into resentment. If you are angry, you might attempt to suppress your negativity only to wrangle with a partner or coworker, creating extra tension. It may seem like everyone else's actions are causing all the trouble, but searching within yourself can help you clarify your own culpability in the current confusion. Accepting your role in the mess is the first step to cleaning it up."
libra,2014-07-30,"You could easily get lost in your own daydreams now as the Moon travels through your 12th House of Fantasy and Spirituality. Your imagination may be the source of an ingenious idea today, but bringing it into physical manifestation is tricky. You have a better chance of accomplishing your goals if you limit the distractions in your life. Block out the noise for a little while; allow the peace and quiet to foster your creativity."
scorpio,2014-07-30,"It might seem as if your friends are a little less available today, but this could be a symptom of your neediness rather than any change in their behavior. It's challenging to understand the emotional distance but you're still motivated to nurture them, even if they don't appear interested in cultivating closer relationships now. Ironically, the more you approach others, the more they retreat. Relax your expectations; redirecting your attention toward creative pursuits may be enough to take the pressure off and allow the energy to reconnect naturally."
sagittarius,2014-07-30,"Your recent efforts at work might have gone unnoticed for too long. Thankfully, recognition comes your way today, assuming that you have earned it. In some people's eyes, you are a real hero. However, you're just doing your job and it's not that big of a deal to you. The good news is that you may finally get the pat on the back you so rightfully deserve. This isn't an excuse to rest on your laurels now, but it's nice to be acknowledged for your high level of commitment."
capricorn,2014-07-30,"You could wind up in a disagreement with a friend, but the tense dynamics should take a turn for the better as the day wears on. Everything seems to be going your way and engaging in discussions with like-minded people cranks the cool-factor up another notch. Conversations may gravitate toward religion or politics even if you usually steer away from controversial issues. Don't be afraid to express your opinions as long as you allow the same courtesy to everyone else."
aquarius,2014-07-30,"You have an uncanny sense of the emotional dynamics lurking just beneath the surface now. Moreover, your intuition is sharp as a razor, enabling you pick up on subtleties you normally miss. However, others might see you as a bit overbearing today, so don't flaunt your power. The tables could quickly turn on you if your confidence morphs into cockiness. You can become confused by someone who resists your efforts if you're not on top of your own game. Keeping things in a healthy perspective ensures your success."
pisces,2014-07-30,"You may end up a big winner on the job today as long as you don't misdirect your pent-up frustration on to someone who is the wrong target. If you lose your temper, the results of all your hard work might quickly go awry. On the other hand, if you don't say anything at all, the outcome could be just as problematic. Fortunately, if you are able to express your strong feelings in a non-threatening way, then others are more likely to rally to your cause."
aries,2014-07-31,"You're confident that you can reach your destination, but you may have trouble verbalizing your needs today. Unfortunately, your desires could be so extreme now that you don't want to talk about them. You might attempt to express your feelings anyhow, only to discover that what you wanted earlier changes as the day goes on. Go ahead and share your heart, but be ready for a few twists and turns along the way."
taurus,2014-07-31,"You don't like it when you're caught off guard, but you may have to respond quickly to new feelings that arise quite suddenly today. You won't be able to blame anyone else now, since this uncharacteristic emotional turbulence is probably a result of your own unconscious urges. Don't withdraw just because you're scared; take every chance you get to face whatever you have been avoiding. Standing up to your fears is the best way to overcome them."
gemini,2014-07-31,"You're often eager to explore nearly any pleasurable distraction, but following your bliss is not that easy today. People bring their own expectations, but you might be ambivalent about their goals now. If you drop everything to go along with someone's unusual request, you'll probably regret it later. Nevertheless, you don't want to disappoint a friend or associate. Do what is required, but don't be surprised if you grow restless and just want to walk away from it all. Find a way to honor your own dreams while still nurturing the needs of others."
cancer,2014-07-31,"One innovative idea after another pops up unexpectedly today, thrilling you with a wide variety of possibilities. However, this isn't a great time to let your uninhibited desires run wild. In fact, it's smarter to filter your thoughts so you don't get lured off course from your larger strategy. The challenge is to discern which dreams are now worth pursuing. Remember, you can explore all your options without having to act on every single one."
leo,2014-07-31,"You could create a little drama if a close friend ruins your fun today, but keep in mind that no one is trying to make your life difficult on purpose. In fact, people are more likely to assist you along your road to emotional satisfaction if you are doing your fair share of the work. Although you might not get your way at first, being a valuable team player greatly increases your chances for fulfillment in the long run. Your spirit of generosity is the key to your success."
virgo,2014-07-31,"Someone may jolt your world unexpectedly today with an intense emotional outburst that doesn't fit into your idea of appropriate behavior. You're magnanimous enough to incorporate this unsettling experience, but you must make a conscious decision to let compassion be your guide rather than perfection. A great adventure can be yours if you accept the fact that you cannot control all the facets of your life all the time. Believe it or not, sometimes it's more fun to let others take the wheel."
libra,2014-07-31,"Forget about feeble attempts to stick to a normal routine now while your key planet Venus is buzzing from her connection with high-strung Uranus. You might even feel as if you're going a little stir crazy, but rest assured it's only the unstable cosmic energy that you have tapped into today. Willingly let constrictive structures and unhealthy assumptions fall away. Resume your regularly scheduled activities once the dust settles and your equilibrium is reestablished."
scorpio,2014-07-31,"You may experience a bit of free-floating anxiety today as you're feeling an odd combination of excitement and annoyance. Although everyone else seems overly stubborn, you're the one most responsible for holding yourself back. Even if you feel constrained by current circumstances, there's no need to focus on your limitations. Instead, allow your feelings to take you wherever they go now without any judgment. Spread your wings and fly."
sagittarius,2014-07-31,"If your bank account isn't directly affected by vulnerable Venus rattling your 8th House of Shared Resources, your love life might be the next thing in line. Don't give anyone else power over you (either emotionally or financially) since your current need for immediate gratification may feel more important than how much cash you have in your wallet. Be willing to take a risk as long as you carefully consider the consequences first. The potential for reward is great if there is give and take between all parties involved."
capricorn,2014-07-31,"Someone may jump to an erroneous conclusion about your desires now, especially if you aren't forthcoming with what you actually want. In other words, what you leave unspoken today might be even more important than what you say. Be bold and step outside of your comfort zone; stand up and share your truth. No matter how irrational your feelings are, nothing can change for the better unless you're willing to put in the effort. No one will doubt your sincerity if you speak from your heart."
aquarius,2014-07-31,"Your instinctual attachment to objects of beauty could land you in trouble today, whether you're attracted to a person or a piece of art. Although your desires aren't always physical, they might manifest that way now. Nevertheless, you're more in love with a concept than with anything in reality. Understanding the nature of your drive helps to reduce your frustration. It's easier to experience more joy in life when you see the glass as half-full rather than half-empty."
pisces,2014-07-31,"Your behavior may seem highly erratic now, challenging others to trust you if they don't already know your heart. However, your emotions are bubbling up close to the surface and a sudden mood shift can be quickly reflected in transparent mannerisms. Thankfully, you don't have to be in total control today. Let your friends know that you are navigating some tricky waters and could use their assistance instead of their criticism. Ask and you might receive more support than you expect."
aries,2014-08-01,"The tension between you and someone special might begin to ease up today, but the source of the stress doesn't necessarily go away. You can take the easy way out and simply move on to the next situation demanding your attention. However, this is a squeaky wheel gets the grease type of strategy. Even if you remove yourself from the initial problem, it will return unless you face the issue and push it into the light of consciousness. It's time to muster up some of that famous Aries courage and get to work."
taurus,2014-08-01,"It's very possible that you don't agree with the direction being suggested to you, but it could be self-defeating to openly go against your partner's wishes now. Nevertheless, you don't have to be afraid to say yes to a spontaneous invitation; trying something new might serve you well today. In the meantime, remember to let go of your plan if others don't embrace it. Your enthusiasm is an asset as long as you aim it in the right direction."
gemini,2014-08-01,"You must decide whether to change your loyalties today or stick with your previous commitment. Your nagging anxiety may push you to choose sooner than you wish. Nevertheless, your discomfort settles down throughout the day as your path becomes clear. Don't allow self-doubt to get in your way. You can influence your future by envisioning it once you know what you want. Work hard and let the power of positive thinking do its magic."
cancer,2014-08-01,"There's no reason to compromise your needs today. You have a precise idea of what you want and are wise to reveal your desires to those who matter. Sharing your feelings may seem scary at first, but your story will flow easily once you begin talking. Others will respect you for taking a stand whether or not they agree with your decisions. You're armed with unabashed optimism, serious determination and innocent playfulness, which might just be an unbeatable combination."
leo,2014-08-01,"Your positive attitude goes a long way toward progressing along the road to success, but even your closest friends might not understand what's motivating you today. Your actions may appear erratic and out of character, but you know exactly what you're doing. Unfortunately, your confidence could backfire unless you're willing to slow down and bring others with you. Avoid the temptation to strike out on your own, even if it takes longer to accomplish your objectives. Reaching your destination is sweeter when you share it with those you love."
virgo,2014-08-01,"Keeping yourself busy is not a substitute for being productive. You realize that part of your job now is to sort out the meaning from the increasing amount of trivial distractions. The pace is growing more hectic day by day and you might feel as if you have no place to hide. However, it's not wise to cut yourself off from the current flow of information because there are gems of truth buried in the incoming data and it's up to you to find them."
libra,2014-08-01,"It seems as if it's no use trying to keep secrets now because everyone already appears to know what's going on in your life. Don't get discouraged; the chaos peaks today and then the energy will begin to settle down. The cosmic forces that are magnifying your social world are almost ready to move on and your life will soon return to normal. Ironically, you may find yourself missing the excitement sooner than you think, so enjoy all the activity while it lasts."
scorpio,2014-08-01,"You have been quietly watching your own show play inside your head, wondering how to bring your story out into the open. Finally, heightened anxiety may propel you toward taking action today. The timing is good, but make certain your risk is worth it because you won't be able to hit the undo key once you make your move. Nevertheless, don't overshoot your target; expending too much energy now isn't wise. It's better to achieve your goals than to fall short empty-handed and exhausted."
sagittarius,2014-08-01,"You may have high ideals and big dreams, only to discover that they are out of place in your external world today. Thankfully, this incongruity isn't a problem. Rather than giving up on your own vision of your future, relegate it to the fantasy realm, where you are free to do whatever you want without external consequences. Keeping the dream alive now is more important than reaching your goal. Taking care of your responsibilities while exploring your imagination allows you to experience the best of both worlds."
capricorn,2014-08-01,"Yesterday's stress begins to settle back down today, especially if you expressed what was on your mind. At first, you might be pleasantly surprised by all the emotional support you receive, but then reality sinks in and you realize how much work you have ahead. Your optimism serves you well, but don't let blind faith be a substitute for following through on your promises. Remember, everything looks a little closer now than it actually is. Reach for the stars but be grateful if you only touch the treetops."
aquarius,2014-08-01,"Keeping your plans in perspective is challenging now because you're painting the future in very bright colors. It's tempting to believe that a large project will require less time and money than it actually does. It's easy to assume that other people will do everything they say, but chances are they, too, will fall short of their promises. Nevertheless, this is not a time for denial or doubt; you can make your dreams come true as long as you don't turn a sensible idea into an unrealistic fantasy."
pisces,2014-08-01,"Your bubble might not actually pop today as long as you accept that it can't get any bigger. The safest way out of your current predicament is to figure out how to deflate it before it explodes. You helped to create the present circumstances by inflating a perfectly good idea until it became too big to handle. Rather than considering your involvement as a problem, think of it as an adventure. You're the specialist on the bomb squad and have been sent in to defuse a tense situation. This is the stuff that creates heroes."
aries,2014-08-02,"Your next adventure is right around the corner if you're willing to express your creativity in a dramatic manner. There is no room now for feeling restricted by the judgment of others. It's all about the exhilaration you experience, especially as you reach outside of your comfort zone for freedom. Temporarily rearrange your responsibilities so you can enjoy the support and camaraderie of those closest to you. This is your chance to demonstrate the power of positive thinking."
taurus,2014-08-02,"Although you wish you could kick back and put your feet up, it seems as if someone in your inner circle of family and friends has big plans for you today. You might discover that you ""volunteered"" for a mission, even if you didn't step forward by your own volition. You may as well just go along for the ride, even if you don't know where it's leading. Sometimes letting other people call the shots can be better than anything you might experience on your own."
gemini,2014-08-02,"You are as busy as a bee today, but you could be having too much fun to notice that you're working so hard. There's a long list of people to see and places to go, and having your calendar overbooked now seems exciting. However, there may be trouble lurking in the shadows because you might not be able to keep up with your jam-packed schedule. Don't wait for everything to collapse like a house of cards. Avoid a major headache by taking the initiative and paring back your activities before it's too late."
cancer,2014-08-02,"You might surprise yourself with what you say today, especially if you had no intention of sharing anything at all. It's as if your protective shell has expanded to include others within your safe space. Here, within your private little hide-away, there are no secrets. However, if you become afraid of your vulnerability, you can always tell everyone to leave in order to re-establish your emotional comfort zone. Remember, you are the only one in charge of setting your boundaries."
leo,2014-08-02,"You may be quite optimistic about what you are doing in spite of the emotional angst you are experiencing today. You can't help but think about certain things over and over again. It seems as if no one understands the complexity of your thoughts now. This is a perfect chance to cultivate patience; although people will appreciate the end result, there's no reason for them to be in touch with your ongoing process. Practice the same compassion for others that you wish to receive for yourself."
virgo,2014-08-02,"You might appear to be extremely outgoing today, revealing your thoughts even before you are asked. Your key planet Mercury is energized with the awesome power of Jupiter and the assertive force of Mars. You're longing to tell all you know, but you can still keep a secret now with three planets clustered in your 12th House of Privacy. Consciously decide what is most significant and cannot be shared under any circumstances. Choose wisely and let everything else be fair game for discussion."
libra,2014-08-02,"Throwing a party sounds like a wonderful idea, but you could make a mess instead of a social gathering if you sweep the details under the rug. Even if you're attending someone else's event, you might still end up playing the role of host or hostess because you are so good at making others feel at ease when you turn on the charm. You may be eager for pleasure, but don't let your desires trick you into overindulging or the good times will slip away before they come to fruition. Moderation is your friend."
scorpio,2014-08-02,"Going on a mini-retreat can be very rejuvenating today; it's as if you are taking a long summer vacation compressed in time. Thankfully, walking away from your responsibilities is easier now than it sounds. Just be certain to gradually express your powerful emotions throughout the day or you may experience a minor volcanic eruption when you least expect it. Channeling your volatility into positive action transforms scary shadows into magical places of healing."
sagittarius,2014-08-02,"There might not be enough stable ground to stand on as you're buffeted around by strong emotional currents. Chatty Mercury hooks up with your key planet Jupiter, inspiring conversations and encouraging you to take a chance by talking about your dreams. Touch your deepest fears and highest hopes, but don't do it alone. Making memories is more fun when you share the adventure with someone you can trust."
capricorn,2014-08-02,"You are driven by a strong need for recognition by your peers. You're optimistic about your future and may strive toward your goals with greater gusto than before, as if you have been tapped for a personal mission. However, if you have fears about your own competence, don't allow them to slip off the radar. Share your feelings with someone close to you, for you are being presented with a rare opportunity to experience a new level of intimacy. No risk, no reward."
aquarius,2014-08-02,You may run out of patience now as unexpressed petty annoyances stack up like dirty dishes in the sink. Your best strategy might be to escape the current situation by dreaming of what's around the next bend. This cerebral traveling brings you an opportunity to develop your long-term goals by encouraging your imagination to drift into the future. Keep in mind that even the greatest journeys of exploration start with a single step.
pisces,2014-08-02,"You are eager to let go of your expectations so you can have some good old-fashioned fun. Nevertheless, there are intense feelings rising into your awareness now, making it difficult to circumvent the truth. Running off in search of transient personal pleasures just leaves you unsatisfied. Instead of falling victim to your own whims, take the no-nonsense path today. Keep your priorities straight and self-imposed limitations won't hold you back for long."
aries,2014-08-03,"You may be feeling the pressure of someone's unspoken emotional demands, and there's no quick and easy way to escape. Although it's summer vacation for many, you still must remain present and fulfill your obligations. A crazy idea could pop into your head today that you hope will save you time and increase your productivity. However, it is smarter to stick with a tried and true method now, even if it ends up taking longer to finish. Save your creativity for another day."
taurus,2014-08-03,A friend or partner may offer you more authoritative advice than you prefer today. You can feel as if others are overstepping their bounds and trespassing on your personal space. But you need to remember that you don't live in a vacuum; you are better off listening with an open mind. Try not to overreact since constructive feedback could be exactly what you need to hear now. Give people the benefit of the doubt; they might just want to help.
gemini,2014-08-03,"You are attracted to all kinds of paradoxes, but a situation today may remain an unsolved puzzle. The more you focus on your list of chores, the less certain you are about how to fit everything in to your day. Unfortunately, seeking another perspective from a friend or associate only confuses you even further. Oddly enough, relinquishing your need to finish on time helps the day go smoother for everyone involved. Not every mystery is meant to be solved."
cancer,2014-08-03,"You might be playing several emotional angles all at once today, but you need to be careful or your ambitious behavior could backfire on you. Strategizing for success is fine, but you must be absolutely straight up about your motives. Don't be afraid to let others know what your needs are without embellishing them for the sake of drama. If your friends understand why you are acting in a particular manner, they are more likely to support your endeavors rather than resist your efforts. Transparency is your friend."
leo,2014-08-03,"Feeling sorry for yourself is a waste of energy today, whether it's because there's a lack of romance in your life or you are at odds with your partner. Although clever Mercury is zipping through your fun-loving sign now, something may be awry as the willful Sun anxiously aspects uncompromising Pluto. Happiness doesn't only come from finding someone special and living out a fairy tale. Rather, you can find joy by committing to express your love, no matter what you receive in return."
virgo,2014-08-03,"Don't dismiss someone's new idea just because it's radically different from yours. You might have to struggle to remain open to alternatives now, but you'll make better decisions if you do. The presence of three planets in your 3rd House of Information sharpens your perceptions and helps you to hone your perspective. Nevertheless, you can convince yourself that nearly anything is true -- until you check it out in reality. Look before you leap for the best results."
libra,2014-08-03,"You have grown so concerned about the opinions of your friends that you could lose sight of your own. However, your ideas are just as valuable as those of anyone else. Ultimately, self-esteem comes from within and not from what others think. Just be careful not to misinterpret the facts; you can easily stretch the truth and lead yourself astray. Remember, extreme reactions may be a clue that emotions are now overtaking reason. Temper your responses by filtering out extraneous noise and listening to your own inner voice."
scorpio,2014-08-03,"You're pulled one way by your feelings and another by logic as the reflective Moon in your emotional sign intensifies your moods. You have a high level of self-awareness now, but it's hard to know whether to trust your heart or your head as mental Mercury gains stature in your 10th House of Status today. Keep in mind that your inner struggle won't likely impede your progress, even if you end up changing your direction in the very near future. Integrating your passion into your work is your secret to success."
sagittarius,2014-08-03,"You can talk yourself into nearly anything today because your key planet Jupiter is still under the influence of persuasive Mercury. You are able to motivate others by sharing the power of your own dreams. But your performance may feel disconnected from your real purpose now, leaving you with an empty sensation in your gut. Rather than trying to inspire anyone else to support your ideas, check in with your conscience to confirm what you really believe. Being completely honest with yourself is the first step in the right direction."
capricorn,2014-08-03,"Even the best-laid plans won't assure success today, but they could help you to leverage your current position in your search for meaning. You don't stand to gain anything from your negative judgment, even though you might not reach your original goals. Instead of compulsively pushing toward the summit, take the scenic route of discovery for a change of pace. Your mission now isn't to reach your destination faster than anyone else; it's to get as much personal growth as possible out of your journey."
aquarius,2014-08-03,"You won't be satisfied with a simple and dismissive answer today; you're eager to do whatever is necessary to get to the bottom of an issue. But digging beneath the surface can unexpectedly take you out of your comfort zone. Although you might grow unhappy with what you discover, knowing the truth is better than accepting the easy way out. Don't worry if others find your approach overly intense now; putting your passion into action is just what you need to do to set things right."
pisces,2014-08-03,"Although it appears as if there are multiple paths to your future, none of them stand out as the absolute best route to manifesting your highest potential. Your uncertainty makes it challenging to set your plans into motion while pressing circumstances force you to concentrate on one specific option, whether you are ready or not. Don't worry if your original choice fails because every little step you make now moves you closer to your goals."
aries,2014-08-04,"It's as if you have x-ray vision and can see through the veneer of social etiquette today, revealing fears that are often kept safely hidden. You are aware of an unspoken agenda, even if everyone else is acting in a lighthearted manner. Your intuition might prompt you to retreat now because you're not sure that you want to engage in a conflict. Just don't pull inward too quickly; it may be that your worries were exaggerated. The person you thought was being negative could turn out to be your closest ally if you give him or her a chance."
taurus,2014-08-04,"You might believe that a relationship can't possibly meet your expectations today. Instead of overcoming your fear and scheduling a memorable encounter, you may choose to just settle back into your familiar routine. However, this laid-back approach is not your best strategy and could leave you feeling disappointed with your choice. Taking the safest route now won't necessarily help you reach your destination any sooner, so open up your heart and make the first move."
gemini,2014-08-04,"You may discover an important piece of information that you previously overlooked. You might have innocently assumed that others admire your creativity and support your ideas. Unfortunately, strong emotional undercurrents raise concerns as you try to comprehend the complexity of the situation. Don't attempt to figure it all out now; the energy shifts tomorrow, enabling you to gain a clearer understanding of your options."
cancer,2014-08-04,"Maintaining your self-esteem is challenging if your friends and associates don't share your values. You want everyone to understand what is really important to you, but the more you talk about your concerns, the wider the gulf becomes. You can try to analyze the situation and logically determine your best course of action, but cool reason may not lead to an ingenious solution now. The wisest answers arise more easily once you stop seeking them so desperately and let your intuition guide the way."
leo,2014-08-04,"Your life is not as happy-go-lucky as others assume; it might appear as if you are having a lot of fun, even if your heart is troubled. Your defense mechanisms effectively hide a deep well of emotions today. But just going through the motions isn't very rewarding, so share some of what's on your mind with someone you trust. If you're having a hard time starting the conversation, write down your thoughts and use your notes to get the ball rolling. Being your authentic self opens the door to a meaningful exchange."
virgo,2014-08-04,"Although you hope to balance your personal desires with the needs of others, your good intentions might run into resistance today. You wish you could just gloss over your annoyance if you think that someone is keeping a secret. However, your suspicion can turn into anger if you don't voice your concerns now. Ironically, you may be wrong about your hunch, but you'll feel a sense of relief once your fears are out in the open. Illuminating the shadows almost always makes them less scary."
libra,2014-08-04,"Your attempt to maintain your cool today is like trying to out run a tsunami. You know big changes are coming that could impact your closest relationships. Even if the shift still seems far off, you may already be feeling the pressure internally. Thankfully, you are capable of finding your way back to the center now if you concentrate on honoring your core values instead of worrying about external events. If you remain true to your highest ideals then everything else will, hopefully, fall into place."
scorpio,2014-08-04,"You don't need to tell everyone what they already know, yet anyone who is overly critical today may be rudely surprised at the intensity of your response. However, you're not looking to alienate others. In fact, it's just the opposite; you yearn for meaningful contact with your closest friends. Those who are seeking shallow social banter could get an earful when you share the truth as you see it. There's no valid reason to bite your tongue; just prepare to deal with the consequences of your radical honesty."
sagittarius,2014-08-04,"You aren't interested in discussing your feelings today while the Moon visits your 12th House of Secrets. Even if others think that you're sharing your soul, you have more happening internally than anyone realizes. In fact, your philosophical ramblings can cleverly hide the real juice. Keep in mind that you probably won't benefit from changing your tactics now. It's wiser to take the conversation to the next level only if you're ready to be more vulnerable with your heart."
capricorn,2014-08-04,"You are more reserved in your conversations with others today as you reconsider what you really want from relationships. Although you aren't likely to isolate yourself completely, you're wary about getting entangled with someone who might create unnecessary drama. Trust your instincts and be ready to walk away from a situation that could complicate your life without offering you any tangible benefits."
aquarius,2014-08-04,"Although you have the best of intentions now, your plans may be thwarted anyway through no fault of your own. Of course, you can't possibly control all the variables in your surroundings, but you can take full responsibility for your response to an unexpected event. Paradoxically, an overly positive reaction could be just as troublesome as a very negative one. Avoiding emotional extremes enables you to make the best of these tricky circumstances."
pisces,2014-08-04,"Your current state of heightened awareness puts you in contact with emotions that may be challenging to integrate. But denying feelings that you don't fully understand creates an entirely different set of problems. You could inadvertently disconnect from the source of your inspiration today if you shut down your compassion. Thankfully, you can gracefully move through your day as long as you remember to keep checking in with your heart."
aries,2014-08-05,"A new wave of optimism could make your energy a little too much to handle today, even if you're unaware of the impact you have on others. Your friends may grow tired of hearing you ramble on about how great your life is going. Temper your exuberance with a dose of compassion for everyone else. Too much of a good thing isn't necessarily a good thing. Turning down the volume on your enthusiasm creates a healthier environment for more balanced relationships."
taurus,2014-08-05,"You aren't shy about your wish to deepen the level of emotional disclosure with a close friend or lover today. Although your direct approach may surprise others, they will be more open to your ideas if you give them time to adjust to your current style of communication. Staying aware of someone else's perspective might not come easily now, but your sensitivity helps to build trust in relationships. Paradoxically, your fixed intentions are best served when everyone brings a flexible attitude to the table."
gemini,2014-08-05,"You might not be so quick to run off on your own today because the idea of collaborating with someone else sounds quite appealing. You are more attentive to what others are thinking while the Moon in your 7th House of Relationships shifts the energy away from your needs and toward those around you. However, your analytical skills may be lagging, so use extra caution when choosing your partner. Test the waters before jumping in with both feet."
cancer,2014-08-05,"Your current confidence has you believing that you can power your way through your work today and still have plenty of time left over to unwind. Unfortunately, you're likely to underestimate how long it will take to finish your assignments with the cavalier Sagittarius Moon influencing your 6th House of Routine. Allow extra time for each task; if you leave a job unfinished, you may not be able to relax, knowing there is still more to do. A sensible approach to planning your day keeps everything running smoothly."
leo,2014-08-05,"You're craving for some excitement today, even if you still have unfulfilled promises to keep. However, you believe that falling short of your goals now shouldn't prevent you from having your fair share of the fun. You may be so jazzed that you're ready to do nearly anything to escape work. But if you walk out before tying up loose ends, at least let everyone know that you will finish up as soon as you can. A lack of communication could turn a lovely play day into a day of regret."
virgo,2014-08-05,"If you have been working long hours, it's time to claim your portion of the fun. But the adventurous Sagittarius Moon is visiting your 4th House of Roots, suggesting it may be fulfilling to stay close to home, instead of going out of town for a short vacation. You might even be able to get your kicks today by starting a simple domestic project or, perhaps, by inviting a friend over to share some quality conversation. Anything that breaks you out of your normal routine helps you to recharge your batteries and gain a fresh perspective."
libra,2014-08-05,"Your restlessness complicates everything today as the action-oriented Sagittarius Moon travels through your 3rd House of Short Trips. You might feel so confined that you make an extra run to the store just to get out for a bit. But don't be self-critical now if you haven't made much progress by the end of the day. If you can't concentrate on your work, it's probably smart to just call it quits and start again tomorrow. However, breaking free for a while might be enough to settle your energy so you can return refreshed and ready to go."
scorpio,2014-08-05,"You may be riding high on your horse, feeling secure enough to spend money on something special. You could be overly optimistic about your income potential now, enabling you to justify a luxury purchase. Nevertheless, it's wise to wait and see how you're feeling about your finances in a few days before making a large expenditure that you might regret. In any event, conserving your resources today leads to additional wealth tomorrow."
sagittarius,2014-08-05,"Impulsively sharing your feelings with someone special can open the door to a magical experience. You seek a heart connection with others because your own emotions are so close to the surface now that the reflective Moon is visiting your sign. Unfortunately, simply expressing your needs and fears is only one part of the equation. Give everyone enough time to share his or her story; real intimacy lives on a two-way street."
capricorn,2014-08-05,"Hiding your optimism isn't usually advised, yet it may be socially savvy for you to be cautious now when sharing your feelings. Your overconfidence could offend someone and you really want to avoid trouble as you rally support for an ambitious idea of yours. Thankfully, your diplomatic skills are currently polished enough to take you far if you can trust your instincts today and do whatever you believe is best. A touch of humility helps to keep things in their proper perspective."
aquarius,2014-08-05,"Your dreams are as vivid as your waking life now, motivating you to share them with like-minded people. Fortunately, you seem to be surrounded with a cadre of friends and associates with the Moon traveling through your 11th House of Social Networking. Luckily, you may already feel the camaraderie you seek, but still want to connect with more people as you push the edge of the envelope even further. Nevertheless, you might do better in a smaller gathering that allows for the intimacy of one-on-one conversations."
pisces,2014-08-05,"Defending your political or social beliefs can be quite empowering today, whether it's at work or out in your community. Your unique perspective is inspiring to others now, so don't hold back when you are sharing your practical ideas about the future. But remember, taking care of business in the present moment is more important than daydreaming about unrealistic possibilities. Seize the day by being the creative leader that others want to follow."
aries,2014-08-06,"There's more than enough to keep you busy these days, yet you're eagerly anticipating the future. Although your current trajectory is aiming you into exciting new territory, it will still take a while to reach your destination. But just because satisfaction is delayed doesn't mean there's time to distract yourself with unimportant frivolities. Procrastination is tempting, but self-discipline is essential if you're going to deliver on your promises. The time is now and the clock is ticking."
taurus,2014-08-06,"You might be preoccupied with what happens next in an existing personal or business relationship. Even if your daily routine is functioning smoothly now, you wish you had more options to consider. It is beneficial to explore existing assumptions and push beyond the current limitations. Although good news may be right around the corner, you must take the initiative and extend yourself to receive it. Sometimes others are simply waiting for you to walk your talk."
gemini,2014-08-06,It feels as if worlds of possibilities are opening up in front of you now and you can get a quick glimpse of what your future might look like. You may even have an unexpected opportunity to share your vision with friends or associates at work. But don't ramble on forever; it's better if you keep some of your story to yourself today. Sticking to the broad concepts gives you room to fill in the details as they continue to develop over the days ahead.
cancer,2014-08-06,"Your initial reaction to an unexpected opportunity at work could be one of uncertainty today. Others seem to be in denial about the resources that are required to successfully complete the job. You're tempted to set them straight, especially if you believe they're avoiding important details; however, your criticism might make you sound more negative now than you actually feel. Don't respond immediately; take several deep breaths and consider how to speak your truth in a constructive and positive manner."
leo,2014-08-06,Your direct approach to life may be somewhat disconcerting to someone close to you today. You have a good sense of what you want and could even surprise yourself now by spontaneously taking a chance and expressing your heart's desire. Just remember that your overtures are more likely to succeed if you adopt a more cautious approach that allows time for processing along the way. It can be challenging to completely contain your energy; slow down and create a strong foundation instead of building a castle on shifting sands.
virgo,2014-08-06,"It's not your usual style to become so excited about the future that you're tempted to start a new project without regard for your regular sense of propriety. Although you're eager to act spontaneously today, it's not a wise idea to move ahead until you research the facts, reassess your resources and re-establish your priorities. Stick to what you already know to be true; the more advanced planning you do now, the better the results."
libra,2014-08-06,"You might believe you can get away with nearly anything today because your confident air seems to clear previously insurmountable obstacles from your path. Unfortunately, your positive attitude won't fix everything; you're not invincible. Don't waste your energy pursuing unrealistic goals. A smarter strategy is to make sure your plans are sensible now so that you can complete whatever you start. Don't throw away your dreams; just keep them in a healthy perspective."
scorpio,2014-08-06,"There is a surprising fork in the road today, requiring you to pick the difficult path or the easy one. It seems like a rather straightforward decision at first, but curves ahead obscure your vision. Whichever way you choose, you have a much better chance of arriving at your destination safely now if you follow a map. Ultimately, your current direction won't matter much in the long run. However, having accurate information at your disposal makes all the difference in the world."
sagittarius,2014-08-06,"You can make an inspiring assessment of where your life is leading with the reflective Moon lighting up your visionary sign today. You're in touch with your emotional needs and are able to communicate them clearly to others in a concise manner. However, this isn't the right time to fritter away your energy on lighthearted pleasantries, even if you're in an upbeat mood and are ready to play. Concentrate on what's most significant, instead; a more serious approach will take you farther now than one based upon immediate gratification alone."
capricorn,2014-08-06,"Your imagination reveals a significant truth as the farsighted Sagittarius Moon travels through your 12th House of Destiny. But even if you uncover a long-buried secret, you may not be willing to tell anyone else yet. Keeping your discovery to yourself until after the Moon enters your sign tomorrow allows you to refine your thoughts until they are ready for prime time viewing. Trust your instincts when it comes to spilling the beans."
aquarius,2014-08-06,"Social networks are a lifeline to your future now as friends and acquaintances encourage you to step beyond your regular limits and try something new. Oddly enough, it doesn't really matter whether or not you're able to turn your fantasies into reality today. It's exhilarating to feel free enough to allow your thoughts to reveal what's possible tomorrow. Save your practicality for another day; visionary thinking creates your path to success."
pisces,2014-08-06,"You are playing out all the variations of future scenarios in your head so you can map out the details of your ambitious strategy. Thankfully, you're thinking far beyond the narrow responsibilities of your current job as you contemplate your place in the world. But setting your goals too high could leave you feeling disappointed today. Nevertheless, dreaming big is still your best bet as long as you put your plans into action one small step at a time."
aries,2014-08-07,"You can see the positive side of nearly anything today -- whether it exists in reality or not. However, you could be swept up in your own Pollyanna-like stories. You may be spinning your wheels, only to discover that you are not making any progress. However, your current job is to keep the faith no matter what happens. Luckily, your dreams might just come true if you maintain an unwavering belief in your potential."
taurus,2014-08-07,"You're willing to take a shortcut to finish your list of chores today because you can't wait until later to let your hair down and relax. Unfortunately, you're not likely to get your plans off the ground by just working faster. Don't be misled by jumping to conclusions. A slow and methodical approach improves your chances of reaching your destination sooner than you expect."
gemini,2014-08-07,"Your artistic and expressive energies are highly activated at work today. However, you may seek avenues of escape -- real or fantasy -- as a way of coping if you are stuck in a boring job. Unfortunately, this is a classic form of denial. Instead of slipping off the reality train into fantasy world, focus on the events in your immediate environment. Actively working to improve your situation today is smarter than burying your head in the sand."
cancer,2014-08-07,"You can easily spend much of this dreamy day lost in the inner spaces of your imagination. However, you could also get confused in the outer world by misinterpreting what you hear. You might even set off on your own, believing that you are following directions only to arrive at the wrong place. Do your best to stay mentally alert and physically present. Seeking out the company of others helps to keep your wandering mind from falling down the rabbit hole."
leo,2014-08-07,"The pace of your life continues to be fever-pitched, and you might be growing weary of trying to keep up with all the action. Rolling with the punches isn't as easy as it sounds. You may feel less interested in external events and long for some peace and quiet. However, your self-interests take a back seat to the needs of others today, as your ego temporarily loses interest in receiving acknowledgment and approval. Connect with the people in your life who matter most. Communication is vital, even if you think you have nothing special to say."
virgo,2014-08-07,"The most in-depth analysis won't likely help to solve your current dilemma. Employing a rational strategy is a trap now since you cannot think your way out of the binds of logic with psychic Neptune in the picture. Whether you like it or not, you must rely on your imagination for the answers. Although the idea of dreaming your way to success makes you nervous, it's time to trust something beyond language. The power of faith is so strong that it might just rock your world."
libra,2014-08-07,"You aren't being as clear as you think and could be easily misunderstood today, so back up your actions with verbal or written communication. Although your thoughts are original and eclectic, you might be feeling physically drained; you simply may not have the energy to follow through with your brilliant ideas. Don't be hard on yourself if you aren't as productive as you wish. Continue to visualize your goals, while remembering that good things come to those who wait."
scorpio,2014-08-07,"You are swimming in a sea of your own feelings now. However, you could encounter trouble determining which way the currents are actually flowing and therefore you find it impossible to get your bearings. Your actions are dispersed by boundless Neptune and you might feel defeated or lost if you focus solely on personal gain. Take a deep breath and let your personal worries dissipate into the limitless sea of consciousness. The wisdom of the cosmos is yours if you get out of your own way."
sagittarius,2014-08-07,"It looks like you are pretty clear about who you are, where you are going and why you want to go there. But as you march along your path, circumstances evolve and morph into something different than the ones that motivated your original plan. Needless to say, this bait-and-switch by the cosmos can be rather daunting. It's imperative that you use your logic to think your solution to this dilemma through before taking any action. The good news is that you Archers are up for the challenge."
capricorn,2014-08-07,"Subtle distractions are blipping on your radar screen and your tendency is to narrow your focus so that you can stay on track. If, however, you embrace the unknown mysteries of the day, you're able to move closer to your goals and have a more enjoyable time in the process. The difficulty is that your navigational bearings might get mixed up. The faster you drive toward your destination, the more lost you feel. Continue doing your work and don't try so hard to get somewhere else. Keep your heart open and be here now."
aquarius,2014-08-07,"Old issues that need resolution are weighing heavy on your mind today. However, you might wish you could check out and avoid the whole mess. The problem is that you may not have a concrete plan in place yet, so your withdrawal reflects your uncertainty. But this lack of clarity isn't as bad as it seems, for your creative visions are in a heightened state of awareness. Slip into your daydreams and imagine all the colorful possibilities of your future."
pisces,2014-08-07,"Your smile can be an enigma to others since they have no idea what's making you so happy. You're secretly feeling proud of yourself as you have found a new direction in your life, even if it isn't obvious to those around you. Although you may be accused of irresponsibility today, you really aren't as spacey as you seem. You are, in fact, navigating with the best tool in your toolbox -- your imagination. Throw away the maps; you know exactly what to do."
aries,2014-08-08,"You may be flying by the seat of your pants now while the Sun in your 5th House of Fun and Games connects with irrepressible Uranus in your impulsive sign. You're extremely motivated to see if you can outsmart karma with your radical behavior. Your mind is crackling with ingenious ideas now, and you are eager to see how they manifest in the real world. Although your drive for success is admirable, don't forget to balance your hard work with plenty of play."
taurus,2014-08-08,"You have a lot of details on your plate today, but you're clever enough to figure out a way to do something more fun instead. You might channel your creativity toward planning an escape from work rather than finishing a project. Ironically, the most radical ideas are the ones you can most likely get away with now, so be outrageous and think outside of the box. You won't ever know what could happen unless you try. Spread your wings and fly."
gemini,2014-08-08,"Events are unfolding so quickly today that you may not have a chance to analyze a situation before jumping into the drama. Normally, this wouldn't bother you in the least, but now you might find yourself in an unfamiliar social setting that surprisingly stretches your limits too far. Don't let fear prevent you from being fully in the moment. It's better to say too much now than too little. Expect the unexpected; the more flexible you are, the greater the rewards."
cancer,2014-08-08,"You're not completely thrilled about being pushed out into the public eye today, but it's probably a smart idea to hide your annoyance for a while longer. Overcoming your resistance enables you to surprise others with a stellar performance. Playing your part can bring recognition by your peers or even a raise in pay, so don't say no just because the thought of being on stage makes you feel uncomfortable. Step into the spotlight and shine."
leo,2014-08-08,"You can get away with being as weird as you want now, setting the stage for a memorable experience. Your need to do something totally outrageous may reach a point of no return today, provoking you to act impulsively. But rather than being sensitive to the needs of others, maverick Uranus harmonizes with the Sun in your sign, encouraging you to do whatever you wish. Nevertheless, there are still unspoken boundaries. Don't step too far over the edge or you'll have to invest a bit of time later cleaning up an unnecessary mess."
virgo,2014-08-08,"You are on a mission today and you won't let someone get in your way without putting up a fight. Fortunately, you can emerge a winner if you are honest about your intentions and don't scatter your energy. Stand up for your convictions, even if you would prefer to avoid conflict. Hopefully, the skirmish will be over quickly and you'll be able to get on with your work once the air is cleared and others realize you mean business."
libra,2014-08-08,"Quirky acquaintances inspire you today, especially if you see them as your ticket to ride. You may feel restrained by current social circumstances, challenging you to escape the boredom of the day. However, it's easier to try something totally different when you're hanging out with free-spirited innovators. Nevertheless, it's a mistake to expect someone else to make your move for you; push beyond your comfort zone and follow your bliss."
scorpio,2014-08-08,"You could be the hero who saves the day at work if you are willing to move beyond your fears and share your unorthodox solution to a complicated problem. Although you might expect others to reject your eccentric idea, they may quickly approve of the plan because they appreciate your radical perspective now. Don't hold your punches; state your case and then let go of any attachment you have to the outcome. It won't take long for others to recognize your genius."
sagittarius,2014-08-08,"It's time to resurrect your dreams of taking a magical holiday to an exotic destination. The Sun in your 9th House of Travel creates an easy trine to irrepressible Uranus in your 5th House of Play, transforming an unfulfilled fantasy into a realistic possibility. But don't bother coloring in all the details yet; just declare your intentions now and start making plans. The anticipation is half the fun."
capricorn,2014-08-08,"There are a few surprises in your personal life that demand your attention now, but ultimately everything should turn out better than you expect. Your drive for stability on the home front runs up against your desire for more personal freedom. Normally, you aren't thrilled when unexpected change strikes; however, you are relieved today when the stuck energy is finally released. Take advantage of this opportunity to finally let go of old fears because they only stand in the way of your potential happiness."
aquarius,2014-08-08,"You have an amazing opportunity today to reveal a part of your personality that you have been hiding from the rest of the world. Fortunately, your key planet Uranus forms a superconductive trine with the Sun and Mercury in your 7th House of Partnerships today, electrifying your connections with others. An existing relationship can be strengthened now if you take a risk and share what's in your heart, even if your feelings are a bit unconventional. Don't hold back; this is your ultimate chance to be uniquely you."
pisces,2014-08-08,"A long-awaited breakthrough at work is possible today and it could impact your finances in a positive way. There's no need to restrict the stream of innovative ideas that you can bring to the table now. But don't waste time making plans or telling everyone what you intend to do in the future. Your intuitive channels are wide open, so get busy and follow your instincts right now before the cosmic tides change direction."
aries,2014-08-09,"You may run head first into an obstacle currently blocking your creative expression. You are often able to impulsively power your way right through the resistance -- and you are awe-inspiring when this bold tactic works. However, an impulsive attack is fool hardy now and could even lead to further frustration. Stop pushing so hard and attempt to understand what this delay can teach you before making a new strategy and trying again. Save yourself from a colossal headache by not fighting the inevitable."
taurus,2014-08-09,"Self-judgments bubble up to the surface now, but you might be uncertain about what is triggering your uncharacteristic negativity. You could believe that you won't get what you want, but you probably are not able to see the entire picture at this time. You need to wait until the current situation plays through to its conclusion. Your words may not have as much impact today as you wish, but your patience and positive attitude still can dramatically shift the energy in just a few days."
gemini,2014-08-09,"It's easy to talk about all those things you would like to change, but making even the simplest adjustments can seem impossible now. This is not a time to accept defeat just because restrictive circumstances might prevent further progress. Don't give up; even if you aren't feeling very confident today, tactical discussions set the stage for the upcoming action. Instead of getting overwhelmed by the details, focus your intentions on the ultimate destination. It's an uphill struggle, but the joy you experience when you reach the top will make all the hard work worthwhile."
cancer,2014-08-09,"You might be feeling a low-level panic beginning to form in the pit of your stomach today. The cosmic energy has shifted and it may seem as if you have missed your opportunity to do something extraordinary. Although stern Saturn is testing you now, this current trial won't last very long if you don't let discouragement get the best of you. Instead, concentrate on gaining clarity about a crucial life lesson you don't want to repeat again. Immediate gratification is not as important when you are busy building a solid foundation for your future."
leo,2014-08-09,"Your rational response to the difficult conditions you now must contend with has significant ramifications in the days ahead. Consider the various alternatives as you face the speed bumps on the road of life. If you take the obstacles too fast, they can wreak havoc on your nerves. But if you slow down and treat them with respect, there will be little lasting pain. Make all necessary adjustments, and make them again if you must. Watch the signs and take your cues from reality; it's telling you exactly what you need to know."
virgo,2014-08-09,"Some aspects of your home and family dynamics might not be going according to your plan, but today you can make positive choices which put you back on the right track. Paradoxically, your flexible attitude gets you farther than trying to sustain your current position. Even if your circumstances seem immovable now, continue to imagine your ideal destination. Once you visualize your goal, don't be afraid to work hard to make it real. Your tenacity is an essential key to your success."
libra,2014-08-09,"You may be facing an emotional dilemma as your plans conflict with the schedules of others. Even your close friends add stress if they act too impulsively for your taste today. They might even expect your assistance in fulfilling their responsibilities. As unfair as it seems, your ability to roll with everyone's demands now helps your companions in the moment and you in the long run. Nothing makes you happier than when you create a solution where everyone comes out a winner."
scorpio,2014-08-09,"You could grow quite philosophical today as you seek to fulfill your basic material needs while also satisfying your sensual desires. Your intuition encourages you to develop an integral vision of your ideal future, but it's apparent that you must make adjustments to your plan as circumstances continue to shift. You might not be able to change your current situation immediately, but consistent effort over a longer stretch of time brings you a lot closer to achieving your goals."
sagittarius,2014-08-09,"Although you have recently felt the expansive power of optimistic Jupiter, you might realize that all is not rosy in the kingdom today. You don't like being brought back down to earth by somber Saturn, but it's nearly impossible to remain confident when you experience a setback on your path. Don't fight what you cannot change; retreat long enough to regain solid footing. Take the necessary steps to stabilize your life now; the pace is likely to speed up soon and you will want to be ready to race forward as soon as reality gives you the green light."
capricorn,2014-08-09,"Focusing on your weaknesses now could lead to a temporary loss of confidence. However, this nagging self-doubt is not because you are less than capable. Your key planet, sobering Saturn, is stressed by a square from the Sun today, highlighting your shortcomings and making others sound overly critical. Don't be concerned with the negativity, even if you feel the brunt of someone's personal attack. Take a deep breath and simply acknowledge the feedback, whether it is valid or not. Use whatever constructive advice you receive to improve your work and then move on."
aquarius,2014-08-09,"Accepting the temporary limitations may not be an easy task now, but it might be the key to your personal freedom. However, this isn't an excuse to ignore your responsibilities or other people's boundaries. Rather, it's an exercise in working within the confines of the current awkward circumstances. Resist acting on your impulsive reactions just enough to maintain the status quo. Today's problems will seem less overwhelming in the brilliant light of tomorrow's Aquarius Full Moon."
pisces,2014-08-09,"The wide-open seas have no distinct boundaries, symbolizing an ideal environment for you Fish. However, restrictive Saturn now presents you with structures that seem to restrain your movement. Don't become overly consumed with regaining your sense of mobility. Instead, use the current situation as a catalyst to reconsider your direction. Take care of your personal needs first; your offer of help meets less resistance from others if you have your own life in order."
aries,2014-08-10,"Even if you believed that everything was under control, you wake up today realizing that you must have been dreaming. The Aquarius Full Moon activates your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes, firing up all your favorite fantasies. As long as you are willing to ride your feelings to their logical conclusions, it can be a very stimulating day. But don't try to stop the show too soon or you might only make matters more complex. Get out of your head and let your heart lead the way."
taurus,2014-08-10,"Perhaps you thought this was going to be just another typical weekend, but apparently, the cosmos has different plans in store for you. Set your schedule aside now, for it probably won't play out anything like you expected. You may be disappointed that you're not getting your way as Saturn the Teacher squares the Aquarius Full Moon in your 10th House of Status. Nevertheless, flexibility can simplify your life and take the pressure off your production anxiety at the same time. Relaxing your rigidity gives magic a chance to happen."
gemini,2014-08-10,"It may be wise to let someone else put on the show and dance at the edge of the cliff today. However, your overconfidence could lead you to take on too much as the Aquarius Full Moon shines in your 9th House of Big Ideas. Thankfully, you are a natural at juggling thoughts and can keep more balls in the air than anyone else. Pare back your commitments before you find yourself in over your head. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
cancer,2014-08-10,"Although it might seem as if everyone is getting in your way to purposefully upset you today, this conspiracy theory is highly unlikely. Unfortunately, people can send a message that lacks compassion as the Aquarius Full Moon stirs up trouble in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Nevertheless, your acute sensitivity leads you to take things too personally. If you step back to gain perspective now, you will be better equipped to handle any emotional twists and turns that come your way."
leo,2014-08-10,"Your moods are like a pendulum today, slowly swinging back and forth between your wish to be responsible and your desire to escape from your obligations. Hopefully, you aren't planning on a day of relaxation because your life might be fraught with complex relationship choices now that the Full Moon rattles your 7th House of Companions. It may feel like you have to defend your integrity but that can be more your issue than anyone else's. Your good intentions will shine through if you just continue to act with kindness."
virgo,2014-08-10,"It may take all of your concentration just to keep up with your own thoughts today. The Aquarius Full Moon lights up your 6th House of Routine, asking you to let the most radical ideas slip away while catching the best ones in the net of your consciousness. Don't bother trying to accomplish too many mundane tasks now; just go wherever your mind wanders. You will land safely back on earth later in the week inspired to be more productive than ever."
libra,2014-08-10,"You might be a bit out of alignment with your friends today, as if you can't quite make the awkward interpersonal dynamics work. Although you may attempt to control your feelings as stern Saturn squares the Aquarius Full Moon in your 5th House of Self-Expression, it's challenging to overcome your anxiety. It's okay if you don't meet someone else's expectations now; your current job is to be true to yourself. Let your words flow directly from your heart; resolution is more likely when you are your authentic self."
scorpio,2014-08-10,"It is as if you're driving on an open road without a posted speed limit. Your responses are highly tuned today and there isn't much that appears in front of you that you cannot successfully navigate. However, the Aquarius Full Moon brightens your 4th House of Foundations, allowing you to optimize the energies of the day while still enjoying your mental sightseeing tour. Slow down your thoughts to get the most from this lunar light; focusing on your long-term goals is smarter than trying to find a short-term solution."
sagittarius,2014-08-10,"Although you are often only interested in the big picture, you're more inclined to concentrate and deliberate on one thought at a time today as the Aquarius Full Moon spotlights your 3rd House of Information. You might feel as if you need blinders to help narrow your focus. But don't waste energy trying to make sense of every little detail in relationship to the distant horizon. Acknowledging the tension between your individual perspective and a more global approach may be enough to improve your attitude and inspire your progress."
capricorn,2014-08-10,"You may be intrigued by an alternative to augment your income now that new enterprising ideas pop into awareness. However, you can still feel restrained by your outdated beliefs as your key planet Saturn squares the Aquarius Full Moon in your 2nd House of Money. You might have to let go of an old plan in order to see what's around the next bend. Instead of waiting for a situation that requires you to react on the fly, pre-emptively process what's on your plate to make room for the present."
aquarius,2014-08-10,"You wake up excited to face the day, although you might quickly discover that you're not in complete control of your changing moods. Normally, you prefer a conceptual approach to your feelings, but today's Aquarius Full Moon lifts your buried emotions to the surface. Rather than succumbing to your unpredictable desires, seek out other like-minded eccentrics with whom you can travel to the edges of the universe. Philosophical conversations with friends help to balance the current vagaries of your heart."
pisces,2014-08-10,"Often times, you're more comfortable with your dreams when they are just a series of symbols that play out in your imagination. However, you are more likely to invent long-winded explanations today that end up lost in translation. Your environment is intellectually noisier than you prefer now, especially while the Aquarius Full Moon illuminates your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. It's easier if you remember that the distractions arise from within you and not from the outer world, regardless of appearances. A bit of silence is part of the cure."
aries,2014-08-11,"Staying within your own limits is a tall order today, especially if someone is sending you mixed messages. It may seem as if a friend is flirting with you one minute and ignoring you the next. Don't be afraid to ask for what you really want, but be prepared to receive a cool reality check if you need it. There might be more going on within your imagination than you realize. Nevertheless, every fleeting fantasy doesn't have to come true."
taurus,2014-08-11,"You may be confused about what you're supposed to be doing today because you don't know whether to help out at home, volunteer at a community event or lend a hand to a friend in need. Although striving for your highest ideals is admirable, you might think that you've failed before you even start because it's impossible for you to live up to your own expectations now. You're tempted to take on too much and miss the meaning of life in the process; slow down, be gentle with yourself and enjoy the ride."
gemini,2014-08-11,"You feel as if you're being pulled in opposite directions today as you attempt to apply your ideas to advance your agenda. However, it's counterproductive to try to solidify your plans while the Moon is journeying through otherworldly Pisces. In fact, the more you narrow your focus, the farther off track you go. But don't totally surrender to your fantasies, either. Your best strategy is to explore your imagination for a short while before returning to your work in the real world with a fresh perspective."
cancer,2014-08-11,"Your dreams are so vivid now that they won't go away even after you wake up and start your day. You might try to stuff them back into a convenient compartment so you can concentrate on your work. Nevertheless, it's not in your best interest to limit yourself to the rational realm today or you could miss out on the benefits of riding an inspirational high. Let others know that it may take more time to put all your facts in order. Celebrating your creativity is the ultimate way to capture this magical buzz."
leo,2014-08-11,"You might not be ready to express your desires today, but your uncharacteristic caution doesn't mean that you are uncertain about what you want. You just need more time for everything to settle down in order to decide how much to share. Until your mental clarity returns, it's best now to err on the side of saying less. You can always tell the rest of the story later when the moment is right. In the meantime, let your dreams run wild and enjoy the show."
virgo,2014-08-11,"It seems as if your friends and coworkers have grown wishy-washy, resisting your requests to be more specific about their feelings. It's frustrating when everyone appears to stop just short of what needs to be said. You're puzzled by their behavior and might not even be able to intelligently respond to the awkward silence now. Instead of asking more questions and putting others on the defense, wait a couple of days before seeking answers again. You can catch more flies with honey than with vinegar."
libra,2014-08-11,"You may be disappointed today when you realize that your vision of the future is built on a fantasy. Whether you had your hopes pinned on an image of success in business or in love, they might fade as you get closer to the object of your desire. However, continuing to feed your dreams may be enough to keep them alive until your current confusion passes. Nearly anything is possible if your faith is strong enough and you're willing to put in the required work. Don't stop believing."
scorpio,2014-08-11,"Your soft and gentle approach may seem a bit out of place today, but a deep desire to connect with others flows from a newfound sense of vulnerability. Fortunately, you don't mind being seen in this state now, yet old self-protective fears still encourage you to maintain some emotional distance. Keep in mind that your actions might be misunderstood now, so take the time to explain your intentions as clearly as possible. Speak from your heart and you can't go wrong."
sagittarius,2014-08-11,"You aren't expressing yourself freely these days, but this uncharacteristic silence isn't because you're intentionally withholding information from those who want to know more. Your motives are likely quite simple now, yet sometimes language complicates matters in unforeseen ways. Instead of trying to justify your feelings, just let others know that you need a bit of time to sort yourself out. Avoid confrontation at all costs; don't stir up any trouble until tomorrow when the cosmic forces are more harmonious."
capricorn,2014-08-11,"Drama seems to follow you wherever you go today. Although your practical outlook helps you navigate the bumpy roads of relationships, you might run into an abrupt ending of the highway. If you want to continue on your way, you have no choice but to clear a new path to travel on. Don't worry about the logistics for now; maintain a positive attitude and keep inching forward. Taking the high road whenever possible leaves you sitting pretty by the time you reach your destination."
aquarius,2014-08-11,"You encounter an unexpected glitch today that stems from your current financial condition. Even if you believe that you're in good fiscal shape, it might become apparent now that you overlooked a small detail that could become problematic. Unfortunately, there's no friendly superhero to magically bail you out just in the nick of time. Even if you must dig yourself out of trouble on your own, take heart because your current efforts should do the trick. You're more powerful than you think."
pisces,2014-08-11,"You have a lot to say now because your inner world may be in a bit of turmoil. Fortunately, the Moon's presence in your 1st House of Self allows you to share your feelings without becoming overly emotional. The good news is that others know what's in your heart before you open your mouth. And when you start talking, your poetic words can mesmerize everyone today before they even know what hit them. Use your intuition wisely; don't squander your gift on meaningless matters."
aries,2014-08-12,"Something flashy catches your eye and perks you up today because you're up for a good challenge. But it's nearly impossible to remain excited about upcoming events if you feel restrained by the memory of a previous failure. However, you can turn an emotional corner now as romantic Venus moves into your 5th House of Love for the next three weeks. There''s no reason to cling to past disappointments; it's a new day and adopting an optimistic attitude is the first step toward creating the happiness that you seek."
taurus,2014-08-12,"You tend to long for more emotional security in your relationships now that your key planet Venus is visiting your 4th House of Foundations. Nevertheless, you can be so insistent about what you want today that problems may arise if you are overly inflexible. Instead of worrying about what you lack, count your blessings. Luckily, your confidence is growing day by day, enabling you to feel happier about your current situation. You have a better chance of finding satisfaction when you demand less and give more."
gemini,2014-08-12,"Sometimes love seems illusory and far away, like a pot of gold at a rainbow's end. However, the action is closer to home today. Your social life receives a cosmic boost when magnetic Venus shifts into your 3rd House of Immediate Environment for a three-week stay. Connecting with the positive vibes around you is more satisfying than dreaming about unrealized possibilities. Demonstrate the warmth of your feelings with a romantic gesture. Don't leave things to the imagination; get up close and personal so others know exactly how you feel."
cancer,2014-08-12,"You are experiencing an emotional transition and may worry that the good times are slipping out of your grasp now that sensual Venus has left your sign. Thankfully, you could benefit by looking back over the past few weeks to see what gifts the planet of love and beauty may have brought into your life. As the Goddess of Pleasure settles into your 2nd House of Self-Esteem, build on what you have already established. Focusing your energy on creating more stability in your relationships gives your feelings a chance to grow."
leo,2014-08-12,People fall under your charming spell while enchanting Venus is enhancing your 1st House of Personality. Consciously integrate the beauty of Venus into your current lifestyle by paying more attention to your image. Just remember that how you relate to others is completely up to you. Don't ignore the love that's already in your life or shut off a potential admirer prematurely. You can't help but be noticed now so make sure to present the best version of yourself. Keep in mind that your big heart is your best asset.
virgo,2014-08-12,"You might feel remorseful today if you recently suppressed your desires because you were afraid of the possible consequences. Fortunately, all is not lost; you still have ample opportunities to experience pleasure ahead. In the meantime, transform your cravings for romance into something more spiritual while Venus journeys through your 12th House of Soul Consciousness. Love comes in many guises now, so open your heart and let the magic begin."
libra,2014-08-12,"You don't have as much time to yourself as you want these days because your social life is keeping you hopping from one event to the next. Although it's wonderful to be part of a group where affection and camaraderie flow easily, you may be fearful about losing yourself in the crowd. The emphasis on social activities could define the next few weeks as your key planet Venus charms her way through your 11th House of Friends and Associates. Don't miss your chance to mix and mingle now; you can pull back and redefine your boundaries later once you've had your fill of the fun."
scorpio,2014-08-12,"Although you could put on quite a performance today, your fear of failure might be holding you back from deciding how much effort to channel into a current project or relationship. You may have to manage the conflict between your personal desires and social obligations, but you are still likely to receive accolades from an adoring crowd anyway. Don't try to compartmentalize everything in your life now; just accept the emotional goodies wherever they appear. Celebrating the magic of the present moment doesn't mean you are any less serious about your future."
sagittarius,2014-08-12,"You may seek the respite of taking time off now, especially if you have been putting in long hours at work. Unfortunately, even your social calendar is brimming with commitments you can't escape. You must deliver on your promises today but, luckily, you can enjoy yourself in the process as flirty Venus shimmies into your 9th House of Exploration. All work and no play isn't part of the Adventurous Archer's game plan. You can take the party wherever you go."
capricorn,2014-08-12,"You might truly believe that your life will quickly unravel if you don't act more responsibly than everyone else. But there is a time and a place to let go of unfinished chores and unfulfilled promises. Don't judge yourself negatively just because you want to partake in the fun. If you have carried your share of the load, it's now time to recapture a more innocent and playful attitude. As Tom Robbins says, ""It's never too late to have a happy childhood."""
aquarius,2014-08-12,"If everyone around you seems to be having lots of fun now, this is a not-so-gentle reminder that you deserve to enjoy yourself, too. Perhaps you recently had to limit your recreational activities because so much was expected of you. However, the energy is shifting now as amorous Venus dances into your 7th House of Companions. Make a phone call and schedule a play date with someone you admire. You have earned the privilege of self-indulgence, so seize the opportunity for romance while it lasts."
pisces,2014-08-12,"You can't help but grow weary of people who assume you are always willing to drop your personal agenda in order to go with the flow. You may be annoyed with those who expect you to set your personal desires aside in order to please them. Although you compassionate Fish are often happiest when serving an altruistic cause, the Moon's current visit to your sign makes you aware that your own desires require attention, too. Discuss your needs openly; tense relationship dynamics should relax once everyone understands your current position. Simply being honest gives others a chance to love you more."
aries,2014-08-13,"Conflicting cosmic messages motivate you to boldly take charge while they simultaneously add confusion to your life. It's not a simple matter to sustain your natural rhythm today because your fear of rejection can hold you back and prevent you from swinging into action. Your task is to find ways to honor both perspectives. Go ahead and move into new territory, but proceed slowly to allow time for your emotions to catch up with your intentions."
taurus,2014-08-13,"You are dreaming in bright colors today and the symbols are different from what they once were. Nevertheless, you are not ready to let go of familiar thoughts and feelings. Don't be hard on yourself; you really don't need to move any faster than what feels right. It isn't necessary to justify your actions -- or lack of them -- to anyone now. Just trust the amazing timing of the universe and graciously accept that you are right on schedule. Exploring your imagination opens the door to new worlds."
gemini,2014-08-13,"Restless feelings may be distracting today, yet you still can play the role of a quiet observer and carefully make notes while considering your alternatives. Allow your inner strategist to lead the way now, enabling you to be more comfortable with the faster pace of your life. Cultivate this intuitive voice as it works to create the most calm and efficient path possible through the stormy emotional seas that rage around you."
cancer,2014-08-13,"You need to be noticed and appreciated by others while the extroverted Aries Moon travels through your 10th House of Status. Although your passions are strong today, they may still be in direct conflict with the logic that you've wrapped around yourself for protection. Thankfully, you instinctively understand that the emotional tidal currents are in constant flux. Ride this wave out and you'll feel like your old self soon enough."
leo,2014-08-13,"Even if you're still uncertain about your priorities today, you're probably feeling more optimistic than you did yesterday. Your path is opening up and you are, at least temporarily, aware of your destiny. However, you might quickly grow frustrated if you believe you need to reach your destination right away. Your journey is going to take time to unfold. Don't strive for goals that are so unreachable that you set yourself up for short-term disappointment. Grant yourself permission to have fun along the way."
virgo,2014-08-13,"You know you must do the right thing now, whatever the emotional cost. Perhaps you recently retreated for a while to make certain your feelings are stable enough to build your future on. Now that your analysis is complete, you are ready to set your plan into motion today; unfortunately, this may not be as easy as you think. Go ahead and make your move, but remember your real goal is your long-term happiness and not immediate gratification."
libra,2014-08-13,"You are able to play out the current situation with your usual style and grace, even if you face a crisis of uncertainty. However, you can dramatically improve the outcome of a tricky set of circumstances if you show up with the proper attitude. You just might snatch success from the looming jaws of defeat, especially if you're working in a partnership now. Remember that you are creating foundational structures and you will have plenty of time to add all the bells and whistles later on."
scorpio,2014-08-13,"You're acutely aware that something is lurking in the shadows of your life now. Thankfully, you are better equipped to deal with things once you bring them out into the light. Although there is a dark side to the magnetic power of Scorpio, this mystery adds to your mystique. It isn't an evil force; it's merely a portion of reality that is not yet known. Watch carefully for signs of suppressed possessiveness, resentment or jealousy. Facing an unresolved issue with fierce determination today all but ensures that you will emerge stronger and brighter in the very near future."
sagittarius,2014-08-13,"You easily fall in love with life now and you're eager for something special to happen. But you're unable to fully express your usual happy-go-lucky optimism as long as your progress is being impeded. Don't look at a current problem as an obstacle blocking your happiness. Instead, view this delay as a gift from the universe. Slowing down to reassess your priorities gives you the chance to learn an important lesson from your experiences along the way."
capricorn,2014-08-13,"You are likely to exhibit self-restraint today rather than sharing your initial reaction to an intense situation. Your conservative approach isn't about politics; it's about your emotional health. Every personal relationship brings its own set of baggage and it's up to you to determine how much you want to carry. You are willing to settle for less excitement, love or money than gamble on the chance of losing everything. However, nothing ventured; nothing gained. Taking a small calculated risk now is better than playing it safe."
aquarius,2014-08-13,"Your telephone is ringing off the hook today, but the psychic calls seem to contain mixed messages. You can't decide whether to follow your initial instinct to socialize or your current craving to be alone. Whatever path you choose now, interpersonal dynamics continue to change whether you like it or not. Staying flexible enables you to gracefully handle the current contradictions as you experience them. Listen to your intuition but trust your common sense."
pisces,2014-08-13,"You might feel as if you aren't receiving enough emotional support now from your closest allies. You could grow discouraged today, but being down on yourself or others isn't an effective use of your time. Your smartest strategy is to analyze the situation objectively, isolate the source of your negativity and then let it go. Create healthy new patterns and keep the communication channels open; even if the process doesn't start off smoothly, stirring things up can bring positive changes down the road."
aries,2014-08-14,"Containing your emotions could be an ongoing challenge today as the Moon hooks up with wild Uranus in your impulsive sign. Part of the problem is that you may have to revise your agenda when facing circumstances beyond your control. Instead of creating more drama by attempting to escape, settle into the work that's now on your plate. Shifting your mind set to a more spiritual perspective helps to reduce the immediate stress. Thankfully, finishing an incomplete task now opens the door to possibilities for enjoyment later on."
taurus,2014-08-14,"You might not be fully forthcoming about your intentions today because you think that your exuberance could attract unwanted resistance. Practicing discretion now is a wise move; however, it's not enough to sit back and wait for the right moment. Use your current time wisely to improve upon your strategy for success. Your perseverance is very likely to be rewarded even if achieving satisfaction takes longer than you wish."
gemini,2014-08-14,"Other people's demands on your time could be distracting if you are surrounded by associates who just want to have fun. However, you know you can't take the risk of playing games that might pull you off track. Nevertheless, you would love to partake in the activities if the pressure of unfulfilled obligations wasn't weighing heavily on your mind. Don't bother with long-winded explanations; simply let those around you know that it's nothing personal and that you will join in the recreation after your work is done. Putting your priorities in the proper order is your best bet."
cancer,2014-08-14,"You're not interested in playing the role of the bad guy just because no one else is taking responsibility for what needs to be done today. The current dynamics can be nerve-racking, especially if your colleagues are as disorganized as they appear. But don't focus on what's wrong; although you might be correct in your assessment, confrontation won't bring you any closer to your goals now. Fortunately, your frustration should begin to fade tomorrow when everybody seems to be on the same page. Wait it out; time is on your side."
leo,2014-08-14,"Your unrestrained exuberance about an upcoming adventure could make others slightly uncomfortable. Unfortunately, curbing your enthusiasm might create an energetic block that prevents you from getting much accomplished. Instead of slipping into denial because you're afraid of stepping on anyone's toes, just soften your delivery. It's not an all-or-nothing proposition; you can share what's on your mind without ill effects and continue to meet your obligations as long as you keep everything in perspective. A little sensitivity goes a long way."
virgo,2014-08-14,"You don't mind fighting fire with fire as long as you're well trained in pyrotechnical matters. However, it may be in your best interest to downplay your authority now and save a confrontation for another day. It's much easier to feel confident when you're in total control of the situation. Don't attempt to force any issues yet; temporarily acquiescing is a sign of strength, not of weakness. You'll be in a better position to apply your skills when you're back in the driver's seat tomorrow."
libra,2014-08-14,"You can't postpone making a commitment for too much longer. Unfortunately, your current options may not yet include exactly what you're looking for now. You could even become so discouraged that you're tempted to throw in the towel and walk away from it all. However, accepting defeat won't make you any happier in the long run. Your persistence might help you find a way through the complicated maze of relationships. Be honest and admit your dissatisfaction while continuing to search for common ground."
scorpio,2014-08-14,"If you are working on a major project, you might attempt to sprint to the finish line today, only to sadly realize that it's still too far away. A healthy dose of self-discipline is required so you don't burn out before you reach your goal. However, you're so ready to move on, it's nearly impossible to graciously accept any delays. Rather than wallowing in frustration, focus on the deep sense of gratification that you will feel when your work is completed and you can celebrate a job well done."
sagittarius,2014-08-14,"It seems as if there's a high price to pay if you take a risk to do something differently today. But your need to express your creativity is so strong that you worry about turning your life upside down. However, you might be too concerned with other people's reactions. Instead of wondering how your behavior will impact anyone else, simply focus on being as productive as possible in the present moment. No matter what happens, you will be in better shape later if you concentrate on being true to yourself now."
capricorn,2014-08-14,"Expressing your emotions doesn't come easily today because you think your goals won't be supported by anyone else's expectations. You might assume that someone is already squaring off for battle, even before you say anything at all. However, you're not interested in engaging in a conflict; you just want people to acknowledge your feelings and validate your perceptions. You can defuse a potentially tense situation by avoiding the blame game and taking full responsibility for what's in your heart."
aquarius,2014-08-14,"You could waste valuable time and energy exploring a wide variety of interests today. Although you're able to make progress, it still might feel as if there are stop signs in front of you, no matter which way you turn. But attempting to cover so much ground is a double-edged sword because you could miss an important lesson now unless you pause long enough to gain a clearer version of the current picture. There's no need to be in such a hurry to go anywhere when there's plenty for you to do right where you are."
pisces,2014-08-14,"You may erroneously believe that spending money on something you want today improves your chances for happiness. You might be tempted to take a quick weekend getaway, but don't necessarily have the extra cash for discretionary purchases. Nevertheless, don't get too discouraged because good news could arrive as early as next week. Believe it or not, focusing on work brings you a deeper satisfaction than the temporary pleasure of any escapist behavior."
aries,2014-08-15,"Retreat from the center of the action today so you can take stock of your resources and gain a new perspective on recent events. The Moon moves into your 2nd House of Money, shifting your focus from fulfilling your psychological needs to handling practical matters. Although you prefer to dream about the good times in your future, managing your financial affairs may be the most rewarding thing to do now. Believe it or not, sometimes the mundane is more magical than anything else."
taurus,2014-08-15,"You might wake up on the wrong side of the bed today and convince yourself that your dreams can't possibly come true. However, the true source of your current frustration isn't that you're being denied the pleasures you seek; if anything, your problem is handling the excesses in your life. Scaling back your over-the-top expectations is a wise strategy that can help you find satisfaction now. Count your blessings; you might discover that you already have more than you need."
gemini,2014-08-15,"You may actually think you're being sensitive to the needs of others, but they might not share your perspective today. It's possible that your coworkers see you as more stubborn and overbearing than you actually feel. Re-examine your role in the current situation to make sure you're not sending out mixed messages that contribute to the misinterpretation of your actions. Having good intentions won't be enough to put your day in order unless your behavior is aligned with your long-term goals."
cancer,2014-08-15,"Fulfilling your current commitments becomes more important to you as the day wears on, even if it's tricky keeping up with everyone's expectations. You're willing to postpone a social activity in order to buy yourself more time. If your last minute change of plans offends someone, apologize and then move on -- but don't doubt your actions if they are consistent with your priorities. Trust your instincts; you know your limits better than anyone else."
leo,2014-08-15,"Domestic responsibilities might conflict with professional obligations today, requiring you to make some difficult choices. Even if you're growing more optimistic about your plans for the future, you must acknowledge that you are only one human and you can't do everything all at once. You want to take care of those who depend on you, but others may have to temporarily fend for themselves. Simplify your life by fulfilling old promises before making new ones."
virgo,2014-08-15,"Don't let your cautious approach to making travel plans prevent you from considering more exotic possibilities. Although logical Mercury's shift into your analytical sign brings your common sense into play, you can be practical while simultaneously imagining a dream vacation. Just keep in mind that you will need to do your thorough research and create a solid itinerary if you are going to escape to someplace that's truly beyond the ordinary."
libra,2014-08-15,"You are more than ready for a little downtime today so you can integrate your recent social activity and prepare for the next round. If you are tempted to take a chance on something or someone new, you still might be hesitant to leave the safety of the status quo behind. Even if your friends are encouraging you to push beyond your limits, don't do anything unless it feels right. Remember, you're not required to justify your actions; trust the intuitive flashes you receive and act on them with confidence."
scorpio,2014-08-15,"A friend or partner might annoy you with obstinate behavior today as the fixed Taurus Moon plods through your 7th House of Relationships. Fortunately, you can maintain your position without letting your emotions get the best of you because of a harmonious connection between your key planets, assertive Mars and powerful Pluto. Others quickly discover that they are no match for your intensity now. Just remember not to expect results immediately; worthwhile objectives may take a while to reach fruition."
sagittarius,2014-08-15,"Putting a carefully considered financial plan into action now could save the day, but it's imperative to be conservative in your approach. Fortunately, you have sufficient energy to make changes and enough stamina to finish what you start. But it's still challenging to be responsible and act with restraint when you know what you want and see a way to obtain it. Fortunately, it's your choice; spending time on the details of your new budget can be the smartest strategy to prevent spreading your resources too thin."
capricorn,2014-08-15,"Love may knock at your door today while the sensual Taurus Moon glides through your 5th House of Romance, but reality could fall short of your idealistic dreams. You might not be able to tell what has changed -- your feelings or the other person's -- but something seems different now. Even if you're not happy with the new situation at first, be patient. Don't be so stubborn that you miss the magic that's happening right in front of your nose."
aquarius,2014-08-15,"Your inflexible opinions about a very close friend or family member could lead to conflict today, unless you're willing to meet others halfway. Instead of wasting everyone's time and energy with territorial posturing, stay aware of the changing dynamics on the home front so you can establish common ground. Giving others the benefit of the doubt is a healthy way to get the ball rolling. A consciously negotiated settlement based on mutual trust is ultimately more stable than a unilateral one built on fear."
pisces,2014-08-15,"You could run into logistical problems today if you are trying to follow a schedule that's overly rigid. Even the smallest delay in the morning could jumble your plans if you haven't allowed for some flexibility. Thankfully, you can be more productive and enjoy a slower pace to the day if you just postpone an appointment or two. More importantly, lightening your load gives you the room to easily respond to a surprise visitor or invitation, if necessary."
aries,2014-08-16,"Although you may be acutely aware of the differences between what you want and what you actually need, you can't necessarily resolve the conflict. Your strong desires can lead you into a complicated interpersonal entanglement you might regret. Sometimes it's thrilling to succumb to your attractions without knowing the outcome, but it's wiser now to exercise caution so no one's feelings are hurt, including your own. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
taurus,2014-08-16,"You are drawn toward people who aren't afraid of expressing their feelings but you would prefer to avoid excess drama. You long for a deeper emotional connection and it's easy to move beyond your fears now if you are pushed by someone you trust. Naturally, you might try to resist by talking yourself into playing it safe one more time. However, a profound experience awaits you if you're willing to let go of your resistance and open your heart."
gemini,2014-08-16,"If you aren't keeping a secret today then someone else might be hiding the truth from you. In either case, there could be an important topic that needs to be addressed. Nevertheless, it may be better to just let things slide for now and focus on what you already know for sure. Everything else will be brought out into the open when the time is right. Patience is the key to your success."
cancer,2014-08-16,"Your friends may seem inflexible today, making demands that you're just not willing to acknowledge. It's tempting to just give them the silent treatment, but denial doesn't serve anyone's interests. Instead, be clear and let others know that they are asking for too much. You might be more inclined to offer them the very same thing they previously wanted once they stop pressuring you. Supportive behavior is best when it originates straight from the heart."
leo,2014-08-16,"You might not be a happy camper today if you're wrestling with an old ghost that comes back to haunt you. Just when you think that you were done with complicated feelings of envy and jealousy, someone's poorly considered actions stir everything up once again. Don't be too hard on yourself or you could get hooked into the negative pattern. Instead, just observe your reactions and then let them go. There's no reason to let your past hijack the joy of the present moment."
virgo,2014-08-16,"You are all set to enjoy yourself today because your heart and your head are finally in sync. It is reassuring when your feelings and thoughts are on the same page and this internal consistency gives you an extra boost of confidence. However, you may have a run-in with a stubborn friend who has his own agenda and doesn't even try to see things your way. Don't press the issue now; there's no need to worry about something that won't even matter tomorrow."
libra,2014-08-16,"Your diplomatic approach usually enables you to create common ground to avoid a disagreement. But today you could lock horns with a friend or lover and you might not opt for the easy way out. Standing up for your point of view is healthy as long as you make sure to pick your battles carefully. If you decide to fight for your position, just remember that it may take longer to resolve the issue than you expect. Keeping the conversation civilized allows you to state your case without hitting below the belt."
scorpio,2014-08-16,"You don't understand why people seem resistant to your ideas today and could grow frustrated with their ambivalence. However, you might not say anything about your feelings because you don't want to create a scene. Unfortunately, withheld anger may turn to resentment if you don't attend to the issue directly. Ironically, if you manage to get things out into the open, a difficult situation can turn into a lovely and memorable one. Delivering the truth with kindness cultivates closer connections."
sagittarius,2014-08-16,"You have a short list of unavoidable chores and you're convinced that you have figured out the best way to finish them all efficiently. Unfortunately, you could be feeling so confident that you inadvertently offend someone by offhandedly dismissing a suggestion that was given with good intent. Just remember that you can still accomplish what's on your agenda, even if you take the time to seriously consider a different approach. Happily, you might be able to improve your original plan if you're clever enough to keep an open mind."
capricorn,2014-08-16,"It may be a smart idea to set aside your important responsibilities for a while and take some time for yourself. Doing something that makes you smile can be exactly what the doctor ordered to increase your vitality and enthusiasm for your busy week ahead. Remember, all work and no play makes you an unhappy Goat today. Go out and kick up your hoofs while you have the chance."
aquarius,2014-08-16,"There's a wide world of exciting possibilities in front of you, but previous promises may require you to limit your recreational activities. Even if you aren't ready to completely walk away from your social life today, it's wise to keep your intentions a secret until you're ready to make your escape. Just remain flexible enough so you can still make the most of your day even if satisfaction continues to remains elusive. Fulfilling your commitments brings its own unique type of gratification."
pisces,2014-08-16,"You aren't likely to give up your original agenda, even if changing circumstances demand that you modify your plans today. Your emotional mobility is limited with the obstinate Taurus Moon camped out in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Nevertheless, you still have the ability to adjust your schedule if you consciously choose to cooperate with others. Improving your attitude is key to shifting the flow of energy in a positive direction."
aries,2014-08-17,"A creative project may not go as planned now, yet there might not be much you can do about it. Strong feelings trigger an undertow of tension, setting into motion a sequence of events that pull you off your desired course. Each time you straighten things out and regain your center, everything quickly becomes bent out of shape again. Don't waste too much energy fighting the inevitable. You will feel better tomorrow if you let go of control today."
taurus,2014-08-17,"You might be confused about your long-term relationship aspirations today, especially if you get lost in the fog while wrestling with a romantic issue. Ironically, your goals become less clear the more your feelings are involved. Although you are at your best when you have a concrete plan in place, it's essential to rely on your faith now. Letting go of the wheel shows your willingness to be vulnerable and allows someone else to steer until you regain your sense of direction."
gemini,2014-08-17,"Your environment at home may be uncomfortably intense today, but this melodrama can be a blessing in disguise. You aren't typically inclined to hang out in the darker places of your mind, but now you are drawn into an exploration of heavier emotions. Consciously try to find a rhythm that works without necessarily pushing the outer edges of the envelope too hard. Making an effort to keep communication channels open inspires others to do the same."
cancer,2014-08-17,"Trusting your current optimism is tricky today if you secretly believe the good times won't last. Even if you receive great news, you're probably reluctant to accept it at face value. Your fear of flying by the seat of your pants could pull you down into a familiar watery world of feelings. However, your confidence can soar to new heights if you make time to explore your attachments to the past before attempting to master the future."
leo,2014-08-17,"You might have to face strong resistance now when you share your concerns about your home or family. It feels as if you're tied up in a tight emotional package. It may seem as if you have no easy way to transform the tension, but an intuitive solution could be within your grasp. Even if you don't think you can find the proper fix, rest assured that it will come to you. If not today, then tomorrow. If not this week, then soon. Patience with yourself ensures your success; trusting the process is the first step."
virgo,2014-08-17,"You have a more realistic picture of how others perceive you now than you had in the past. However, your new found clarity doesn't necessarily give you a direct route out of your present dilemma. In fact, the frustration you face may stem from your belief that the current problem shouldn't be difficult to solve. No matter the level of anxiety, your understanding of its cause will help you move more quickly through the obstacles that are in your path."
libra,2014-08-17,"Even if you choose to follow your heart into action now, a down-to-earth practicality about your dreams emanates from your head. You're ready to make a change, but it must be for the right reason. The best justification for anything you begin now comes from your own core values. Remember, if your new direction brings you emotional balance and spiritual growth, you're probably doing exactly what's right at this time in your life."
scorpio,2014-08-17,"As much as you might want to cling to your past, your ambitions are pushing you into brand new territory today. Your strongest passions are undergoing metamorphosis as you explore new avenues of self-expression. You are at the center of your world now and carry a real sense of purpose. You have been preparing for this journey long enough; it's time to create a strategic plan that brings you a few steps closer to your desired destination."
sagittarius,2014-08-17,"You appear to be transparent to those who know you but your true colors are hidden from everyone now, even your closest friends. Complex worlds of fantasy are bubbling up from the depths of your own subconscious mind. Nevertheless, you need not be concerned with the workings of your imagination today; instead focus on bringing happiness and joy into the world -- even if you have to start with your own."
capricorn,2014-08-17,"If a friend comes to you with a proposition today, you might have to tell him or her that you can't turn your back on your own personal freedom and integrity. Your response may feel harsh in the moment, but it must be said if it is the truth. Even if you have to deal with someone's anger, it's not your place to try to fix every situation. All you can do is listen and be a witness to whatever happens next. The only feelings you're responsible for are your own."
aquarius,2014-08-17,"The battle between your logical head and your irrational heart is now in full swing. However, this conflict is playing out within your mind where no one else sees it. Instead, others think you're capable of holding a powerful position in the community while still remaining compassionate. The good news is you can be sensitive without losing face so there's no need to hide your process. You are more loveable when you share your inner truth."
pisces,2014-08-17,"Even if you currently worry that your world is becoming more restrictive, it's not. Reality demands that you take a leap of faith and focus your efforts on a singular path now. Keep in mind that this temporary narrowing of awareness also helps you to see the changing needs of those around you so you can respond accordingly. Thankfully, sharing your emotional perspective with your coworkers and friends makes all the trouble worthwhile."
aries,2014-08-18,"No one knows better than you Rams how much easier it is to start a project than to finish it. However, pursuing pleasure sounds like a lot more fun than following through on your commitments. You're ready to cash in your chips today and head out for a good time as soon as an irresistible temptation comes along. Nevertheless, a creative approach to your work might help you settle down and focus. Meeting your obligations first allows you to play with a clear conscious later on."
taurus,2014-08-18,"A wonderful day could unfold before your very eyes without much effort on your part. In fact, if you must earn some money or venture into the world to work, you can't help but look forward to returning to the relaxation and fun that awaits you back in the comforts of home. Happily, you're able to enjoy yourself no matter where you are, as long as you feel safe and secure. The good news is you can take the party with you wherever you go."
gemini,2014-08-18,"You're operating at an extremely high level of efficiency, enabling you to achieve nearly any goal -- at least, that's how it feels today. However, you are so clever now that you could invite unnecessary trouble and your positive attitude can only go so far to save you. Happy times are heading your way, but don't get so blinded by the possible romantic delights that you forget your mundane responsibilities. Practicing moderation leads to more enjoyment than pushing the limits too far."
cancer,2014-08-18,"You are inspired by your attraction to the finer things in life now. Spending money is a tempting way to nurture yourself and your loved ones today. However, there are diminishing returns on buying your way to happiness. Stick within your budget while remembering that greater fulfillment can be found in the emotional and spiritual realms, rather than the material."
leo,2014-08-18,"Life might be quite grand for you Lions now, making it all the more critical to remember that too much of a good thing can quickly turn sour. Your tendency is to gloss over anything negative at this time; you want to take a great idea and make it even better. Go ahead and pursue the enticing opportunities that come your way, but keep in mind that exaggeration isn't useful. Tempering your extravagances today enables your current pleasures to last into the future."
virgo,2014-08-18,"You are motivated to prove yourself on the job, but you may lack the follow-through you need now to stand out in front of the pack. You don't want to work so hard that you grow resentful because there's no time left over to relax. Relationship dynamics are tricky enough and expressing your personal needs does not necessarily add stability to the equation today. Naturally, it's lovely to be able to dream about your ideal scenario; but you can avoid creating drama by keeping some of your fantasies to yourself."
libra,2014-08-18,"You can count your lucky stars now that your key planet Venus embraces bountiful Jupiter in your 11th House of Hopes and Wishes. You might receive a financial reward or, at least, fortunate news that positively impacts your life. However, your current optimism is not based on fate alone. Your sweetness works in your favor today, so use your cosmic good fortune to connect with like-minded souls. Dance until your heart is content."
scorpio,2014-08-18,"You're ready to face complex issues that have been secretly troubling you. Yesterday's unconquerable mountain becomes today's pesky molehill. You're better equipped to project your needs into the world now, so others can clearly see your authentic self. Don't back down from your true purpose no matter what. Although you're tempted to kick back and enjoy the company of others while sweet Venus and joyful Jupiter are harmoniously working together, this journey is all about following your destiny."
sagittarius,2014-08-18,"Your planning period is coming to an end, so stop dreaming about your future and move purposefully toward it. Put your intentions into action by finally making those travel arrangements that have been floating around in your fantasies. The possibilities are endless if you're willing to take a chance and reach for your dreams. The time to hesitate is through, so get busy while the planets are smiling in your direction."
capricorn,2014-08-18,"You have a rare opportunity to confront important issues about the secret mysteries of the universe and the complexities of intimacy. Fortunately, even the stickiest of subjects is now fair game for open discussion. The good news is things will lighten up and others just might shower you with love and appreciation. Even if you already know you're blessed, consciously give yourself permission to bask in the light."
aquarius,2014-08-18,"Someone special may be warming up to you today and it makes your heart smile. Although his or her message could be quite poetic, it might lack real substance. On top of that confusion, it's challenging to put your own emotions into words. Thankfully, you feel needed, even if you don't understand why others are being so nice to you. Although you're having trouble finding your confidence, use your current experience as an opportunity to practice the acceptance of love."
pisces,2014-08-18,"You can feel the good vibes all around you and are, in turn, eager to do whatever is necessary to demonstrate your good intentions to others. Nevertheless, you could easily take your exuberance to an extreme, so be aware of your current tendency toward embellishing reality to make it taste sweeter. There will be a price to pay if you emotionally over-commit now. Consider the ramifications of your actions before you push the edges of the envelope too far for comfort."
aries,2014-08-19,"You're usually pretty sure of yourself when you say something in front of a crowd, but you might inadvertently climb out on a limb now without realizing what you have done. Thankfully, you can avoid an uncomfortable situation by shifting gears to think about how others will perceive you rather than simply concentrating on delivering your message. Check your facts; it's not worth jeopardizing your reputation by spreading misinformation just because you want to be the leader of the pack."
taurus,2014-08-19,"You might feel as if your emotions have been recently on display for the whole world to see. You only have to say a few words and everyone already knows the entire story. Although being in the spotlight can make you uncomfortable today, it's entirely possible that no one knows any more than you've told him or her; it's just your imagination that feels invaded. Don't waste energy protecting what isn't in danger and worrying about things that will never happen. Focus on reality instead."
gemini,2014-08-19,"It's a communication-rich day, but you might have trouble saying exactly what you mean because your mind is wandering with the Moon back in your changeable sign. Oddly enough, people won't understand you if you try to be too concrete when telling them the facts. You're better off today sticking with sharing your dreams than trying to give someone driving directions. For now, be a visionary and simply follow the lead of your vivid imagination as it paves a path into your future."
cancer,2014-08-19,"You long to share your secrets today and may go to great lengths to find the right time and place to tell someone what you've been hiding. However, one reason you are not as threatened now is that you are temporarily living in a world of dreams and might believe that you are emotionally secure. Just make sure you don't set yourself up for an unexpected surprise when, in a few days, reality comes knocking at your door. Finding a trustworthy confidant makes all the difference in the world."
leo,2014-08-19,"An intense personal situation lightens up today, but it might only be a temporary reprieve in the storm. Unfortunately, the underlying problem is not so easy to resolve. It's more likely that you're just taking a break and aren't feeling the same sense of urgency to get to the bottom of the conflict. However, you are just putting off the inevitable. You might as well dig in now since you must deal with reality sooner or later. A simple attitude adjustment aims you in the right direction."
virgo,2014-08-19,"You want to convey the information you have at your disposal as correctly as you can. You are determined to be accurate with discerning Mercury now visiting your rational sign. However, dispersive Neptune is pulling the other way, diffusing your carefully chosen words and confusing your thoughts. Try to be less judgmental in your tone, for your attempts at clarification can be perceived by others as a power play. Let yourself think like a poet instead of a scientist for a change."
libra,2014-08-19,"Your big ideas may conflict with how others want to do their job today. Naturally, you want to get along with your friends, but it's not going to be that easy because a simple misunderstanding could upset the dynamics. You must let go of your hidden motives for your own good. Maneuvering for power can interfere with your straightforward attempts to finish the work at hand. Don't try to solve a problem by aiming at the distant horizon, focus on the target closest to you instead."
scorpio,2014-08-19,"One of your familiar dilemmas centers on your natural desire to go deeper and someone else's fear of those very same emotional depths. Instead of diving beneath the surface today, you might want to downplay your most intense passions. Nevertheless, your good intentions could backfire as your spouse, partner or friend grows annoyed and thinks you are being disingenuous. Rather than dancing around the truth, it's better to be honest and speak straight from your heart."
sagittarius,2014-08-19,"Relationship dynamics go through changes today as fast as the clouds drift by on a breezy summer day. Unfortunately, you may be confused by the current lack of stability, making it nearly impossible to tell what is true and what is not. Adjust your strategy and keep your long-term goals in sight instead of focusing on the minute details of your fluctuating moods. Ironically, consciously shifting your perspective to the changing circumstances actually anchors your emotions when you need it most."
capricorn,2014-08-19,"You really want to understand the underlying motives of someone's behavior now, but the source of the emotional intensity is elusive. Every time you step closer to an answer, it changes form and slips away. Don't let your frustration level build too high as you attempt to solve the mystery. Accept that you may have to wait a few days to wrap your mind around the current puzzle. In the meantime, the best thing you can do is mind your own business and channel your curiosity into your work."
aquarius,2014-08-19,"People all around you might seem as if they are too showy for your personal taste today. You're not sure you can trust their bold actions which appear to be covering up something else. Try as you might, you can't figure out what's beneath their slick veneers and charming smiles now. Instead of relying on logic, go to your own inner source by opening a channel directly into your imagination. Bypassing analysis is your fastest way to discovering the truth."
pisces,2014-08-19,"You would like to drift off in your beautiful balloon today, but people may be so demanding of your time that your fantasies will have to wait. It's as if you have lots of metaphysical information at your disposal, but it disappears as soon as you try to express it with any certainty. Some of the most magical experiences are better left unspoken. Keep the dream alive by trusting the creative process instead."
aries,2014-08-20,"Visions of romance come and go with the wind but you need to express your feelings to manifest the love you seek. Unfortunately, your fear of rejection or commitment may prevent you from acting on your desires today. Your emotions can lead you astray if you let your imagination run wild. Rely on the facts now and not your intuition; cool logic keeps you on track better than chasing a dream."
taurus,2014-08-20,"Your uncharacteristic uncertainty prompts you to withhold your true feelings today. You might not feel emotionally safe enough to fully let down your guard out in public. However, you could find unexpected pleasure within the familiar comfort of your own home and family now. Nevertheless, current circumstances keep you busier than you prefer. You can't change everything to your liking, but making little adjustments throughout the day brings enough progress to keep you happy."
gemini,2014-08-20,"Your desire to keep the flow of information moving swiftly along is in direct conflict with complex circumstances that are requiring you to slow the pace down. Although you want to make something happen in the real world, you're more inclined to spend time in deep contemplation now. Ultimately, you must establish workable priorities by deciding which interactions are useful and which ones can be eliminated. A no-nonsense approach allows you to accomplish more than you expect."
cancer,2014-08-20,"Your self-esteem is on the upswing; you want others to notice your talents and appreciate what you have to offer. However, it's not easy to put your feelings into words while the hypersensitive Moon is traveling through your sign. Instead of sharing too much information about yourself today, process your emotions on your own and then tell your story after you have time to think about it for a while. Waiting a couple of days gives you a chance to fine-tune your message for the optimum impact."
leo,2014-08-20,"Others may find you quite alluring these days as several planets move through fabulous Leo and your 1st House of Personality, but you can only bend the rules so far. The idea of self-indulgence sounds tempting enough to consider skipping out on your responsibilities. You may seek satisfaction through a quick escape; however, this strategy isn't a smart idea since the backlash at work could be more intense than you expect. Honoring your commitments offers its own sweet rewards."
virgo,2014-08-20,"Your brain has been operating in high gear ever since the weekend when cerebral Mercury moved into your analytical sign. Your senses are sharp and your thinking is clear. Nevertheless, you might still be distracted by your fantasies now, especially if someone is currently showing romantic interest in you. But don't waste precious time in the pursuit of unrealistic dreams; be rational and do what makes the most sense, instead."
libra,2014-08-20,"Your friends might be more oriented toward building relationships than you are now since your attention is primarily focused on your career ambitions. Nevertheless, you don't want to lose your existing connections with others. Fortunately, you get along with nearly anyone at work these days because you can perceive unrealized potential everywhere you look. Remember, your current success may require you to keep your feelings under cover, so think carefully about your words before you start to speak. When in doubt, err on the side of silence."
scorpio,2014-08-20,"You could feel a little bent out of shape now because you don't believe that your friends truly understand your intentions. Even if you specifically make a point to tell them about your inner process, they still might jump to the wrong conclusions. Nevertheless, expressing your opinion is still healthier than keeping it bottled up inside. Simply state your side of the story but don't force the issue; those who care the most will eventually appreciate the secrets you share."
sagittarius,2014-08-20,"You are on the hunt for the perfect travel companion to accompany you on your next great adventure. But even if you're flying solo, this is a perfect time to plan a special vacation or embark on a quick summer getaway. Nevertheless, you must be careful about how much you disclose today because other people's expectations may not match up with your desires. Share what you must, but keep your most unconventional thoughts to yourself until you know you are in like company."
capricorn,2014-08-20,"Relationships may be playing the cosmic energy out on a battlefield now, especially if your needs go unrecognized by someone you love. You're tempted to retreat into the safety of your inner world instead of confronting your fear of rejection by asking for what you want. There's absolutely nothing wrong with taking a bit of time today to sort out your feelings. Fortunately, communication grows easier over the next few days, enabling you to resolve the current stress sooner than you expect."
aquarius,2014-08-20,"Playful interactions between you and someone special may be deliciously sweet now. But it's not all fun and games, even if you can fire up a new relationship or refuel an old one. There might be underlying tensions that prevent you from feeling emotionally fulfilled. Clear communication is the most essential element. Take a risk and express what's on your mind. Sharing your dreams opens the door to wonderful possibilities."
pisces,2014-08-20,"You may feel as if you're swimming in an entirely different ocean today, even if you're still splashing about in the same old pond. Your current disorientation challenges you to balance your starry-eyed idealism with a more practical and grounded approach to life. Don't rely on anyone to tell you what's real because talkative Mercury's presence in your 7th House of Companions allows others to sound more definitive than they really are now. Analyze all the facts, listen to your intuition and then decide for yourself."
aries,2014-08-21,"You may secretly worry that reaching your goals will take more time and effort than you have available. Nevertheless, it still makes sense to push forward today or you might lose your edge of enthusiasm. Life is challenging now because one part of you wants to race ahead while another voice is telling you to slow down and proceed with caution. Paradoxically, sharing your dilemma can alleviate your stress and help pave the path to your success."
taurus,2014-08-21,"You might have fundamental issues that need addressing now and, thankfully, you're up for the task. But, even if you are eager to discuss what's on your mind, circumstances make it difficult to rock the boat. You may be hesitant to soften your stance since you realize the overall significance of the current discussion. Push beyond the resistance; speaking your piece today is better than waiting for a perfect moment sometime in the future."
gemini,2014-08-21,"You can see a roadblock looming ahead, but your anticipation of a delay gives you more time to think everything through before opening your mouth. Often, you speak your mind first without knowing where the conversation will take you. However, making it up as you go isn't a smart strategy now. Summarize your thoughts by creating an outline to help you better organize your ideas. Doing your homework in advance helps you clarify your message."
cancer,2014-08-21,"You may feel emotionally charged, but it's not necessary to let your moodiness prevent you from expressing your truth today. Thankfully, you get extra juice out of a deep and meaningful conversation, but your perspective could be too extreme now for anyone to handle. Be sensitive to other people's needs if you must bring up a difficult subject. Remember, someone else might not be as inclined as you are to dig up hidden feelings, even if your intentions are good. Pay attention to the feedback you receive before going too far."
leo,2014-08-21,"Something could happen today that triggers memories of a past emotional experience which might make you want to bury your feelings. Strong passions are lurking just beneath the surface and you would prefer to keep them out of sight. Don't try to force anything out into the open; trust your own judgment if you believe that acting cautiously is a good strategy now. You can always put your thoughts down in a journal, since this reflective exercise keeps your process moving along in a healthy manner."
virgo,2014-08-21,"Although logical thinking comes naturally to you and you're at the top of your mental game now, you may be quite hesitant to delve into the emotional realms. Still, you could end up engulfed in a complicated set of circumstances involving others. Don't allow yourself to get distracted by someone else's drama if it's just a way to avoid a serious matter of your own. Rather than focusing your energy on external events, honor your true feelings instead."
libra,2014-08-21,"You might not enjoy being in the public eye today if you're feeling emotionally vulnerable, but you're likely to feel more secure as time moves on. But first you must get through these next few days of practical logistics and strategic planning, even if you typically prefer a more flexible approach. Thankfully, applying yourself diligently now improves your chances of being rewarded later on for your hard work. The only person you need to impress is yourself."
scorpio,2014-08-21,"You are looking at relationship issues through a very practical filter today; however, dealing with mundane reality won't stop you from dreaming about your future. It's just that your fantasies are more likely than ever to cross the metaphysical gap and manifest as reality now, so don't waste a perfect opportunity on a passing whim. Take control of your life by visualizing exactly what you want to happen and then do everything in your power to make it so."
sagittarius,2014-08-21,"Surprising conversations about your career objectives may be initiated by other people today, and you might as well go along for the ride. There's a lot of ground to cover as you concentrate on the logistics of work. Even if you would rather take it easy now, don't miss this chance to solidify a business deal or stabilize your place in the community. Your peers will follow your lead if you act with confidence and integrity."
capricorn,2014-08-21,"You could benefit from sharing your thoughts with others today since there are still significant issues that remain unresolved. Fortunately, your natural talent for organizing ideas makes your presentation even better. Nevertheless, it's also wise to trust your feelings and listen to your heart when you get a moment alone. You can always  ask your closest friends to warn you if you wander too far off track. It never hurts to have a second opinion from someone you trust."
aquarius,2014-08-21,"You would like everyone to take you more seriously now; you're in a productive phase and want to be appreciated for your contributions. Show up and perform your job to the best of your abilities, even if it's behind the scenes. Don't worry if others appear to be unaware of your efforts since it may take additional time to gain recognition. Keep up the hard work; karma is on your side."
pisces,2014-08-21,"Taking a break from your daily routine sounds like a perfect idea today but practical concerns weigh heavily on your mind. There's no point in resisting your responsibilities now, so delay the fun and games until you finish your chores. Someone may demand even more of your time and energy than you think you have to give. Nevertheless, do your absolute best and then reward yourself with a bit of well-earned rest and relaxation once you're done."
aries,2014-08-22,"Containing your restlessness might be a hopeless task today, even if you start out with the best of intentions. You can't settle down because wild and crazy Uranus just won't leave your key planet Mars alone now. This cosmic trigger could make you feel high-strung, yet you may not be able to fully capitalize on this electricity that is activating your nervous system. Go ahead and let others know you're on edge, but remember to be particularly sensitive to their boundaries so you don't make matters worse. Channel your frenetic energy into your work, instead."
taurus,2014-08-22,"It's all too easy to misjudge the severity of a relationship disagreement now. You might mistakenly believe that you can solve a dilemma with just a wave of your hand. But, of course, it isn't that simple. Thankfully, concentrating on the root causes and not the symptoms helps to soften the hard edges of a potentially explosive situation. Treat the ones you love gently and with the same respect you wish to receive in return."
gemini,2014-08-22,"Your current actions might inadvertently express more than you intended today as you unsuccessfully try to ignore what everyone else can plainly see. Denial is a waste of your energy, so just accept the consequences without resistance, instead. Even better, say what's on your mind without trying to hide the truth from anyone who deserves to know the complete story. You may be surprised with the outcome once the facts are out in the open."
cancer,2014-08-22,"You are capable of showing your best side now, but there's no need to overstate your case. In fact, others may see your grandiose gestures more as an expression of insecurity than anything else. Luckily, your confidence shines through if you just remain true to your beliefs. Maintaining your integrity is the key to successfully reaching your audience."
leo,2014-08-22,"It might feel as if today is two different days wrapped into one. Your fear of vulnerability can make you uncharacteristically shy for the first part of the day. Then, as the evocative Moon dances into affectionate Leo, your caution quickly morphs into a more positive and outgoing attitude. There's no need to justify your change of heart; just do what feels right and let love lead the way."
virgo,2014-08-22,"Although you're not about to lay all your cards face up on the table, you might want to consider being more forthcoming with your feelings today. This emotional openness could prepare you for an unexpected encounter that brings your insecurities dangerously close to the surface. You don't gain anything by forcing the issue; everything will be revealed naturally at just the right time. Paying close attention to your dreams can show you a clear path into your future."
libra,2014-08-22,"Even if you intuitively know that your silence on a particular matter could propel your agenda forward, it still may be impossible to keep your lips sealed today when friends or associates ask leading questions. You might eagerly disclose too much information, so it's critical to monitor your reactions prior to opening your mouth. Remember, you can't take back what's already been said. Look before you leap, think before you talk and take the high road whenever possible."
scorpio,2014-08-22,"You won't have to go looking for distractions now, since others seem to have an abundance of fun-filled ideas to offer up for your entertainment. It's fine to take a break from your chores as long as you get the most crucial ones out of the way first. Nevertheless, you can't escape the inevitable; your unfinished work is not going to disappear on its own. Evading your commitments today could create a serious backlash next week. Demonstrating responsible behavior sets the right tone for everyone else."
sagittarius,2014-08-22,"Your wanderlust has you feeling irrepressibly restless today, making it challenging to maintain the status quo. You might be worried about how long you can sit still before making your big escape. Keep in mind that you don't actually need to leave town to satisfy your craving for adrenaline. Don't jeopardize your security for the sake of an adventure: find ways to infuse your life with more excitement now without necessarily turning everything upside down."
capricorn,2014-08-22,"It's time to put on a little performance so you can show everyone how serious you are when it comes to having fun. Whether you are thinking about a quick getaway with your family or just hanging out with friends for the evening, make certain that you have a solid plan in place. However, your original agenda won't likely work perfectly because of changing circumstances. Your flexible attitude brings you closer to discovering the pleasure you seek."
aquarius,2014-08-22,"Relationship dynamics don't seem to get any less complicated today, even if your intention is to simplify your life. Nevertheless, you could experience an unexpected clash of values with no resolution in sight. Paradoxically, withdrawing from the conflict only amplifies the lingering tension. But expressing your needs falls short of a full solution; you must also be willing to actively listen. Communication is a two-way street."
pisces,2014-08-22,"Although you may be tempted to act spontaneously today, it's crucial to slow down so you can establish a healthy routine in your life. Unfortunately, the more rigid your schedule is now, the greater your need to demonstrate your unconventional side. But don't sacrifice one extreme for the other. Your ultimate happiness depends upon being both emotionally stable and wildly creative at the same time."
aries,2014-08-23,"You may feel as if it's now or never. You're worried that your window of opportunity is going to close before you're ready. However, it's not wise to try to make up for lost time now. You had your moment in the Sun and it's best to let the magical experiences ripen naturally instead of panicking and acting out of desperation. In the meantime, allow your feelings to come out to play before the changing tides carry them into the past. To every thing there is a season."
taurus,2014-08-23,"You prefer to finish what you start and may grow anxious when there's so much happening that you can't keep up with the pace. Other people are expecting so much from you now that you don't know what to do first. In a last-ditch effort to manifest the simplicity you seek, you might overreact and do nothing at all. Of course, this act of rebellion won't solve anything. Gently push against your own frustration without becoming desperate. Sharing your secret fears with someone you trust tips the scales in your favor and brings you peace of mind."
gemini,2014-08-23,"You may find yourself interacting with a new group of friends today, wanting to discuss subjects you never dreamed of sharing. But your unconventional ideas flow easier within your imagination than in reality. Your naivete bumps up against other people's more cynical ways. Although your mind is racing at warp speed, you need to slow down and take someone else's feelings into consideration before blasting ahead with your agenda. You don't have all the answers yet, so wait for the rest of the story to be revealed before doing something you might regret."
cancer,2014-08-23,"Conflict between what your head tells you and what your heart knows can resolve only if you have the courage to listen to both perspectives. Your thoughts are valid and you don't need to adjust them. But what you do with your emotions is a different story. There's no rule that says you have to express everything you feel. Finding balance now may be challenging, but you will be happier if you, at least, move in that direction."
leo,2014-08-23,"Just when you settle into a pace of life that works for you, change arrives on your doorstep. You may sense that summer is soon coming to an end, reminding you of everything still left undone. Fortunately, your indefatigable confidence can overcome the doubt you might have about narrowing your options. Keep your eyes on the future and your finger on the pulse of the present moment. There's still time to experience the power of now."
virgo,2014-08-23,"You receive a cosmic attitude upgrade today; people actually see a ""sunnier"" you now that the radiant Sun is back in your sign for the next four weeks, illuminating your 1st House of Personality. Paradoxically, you might not feel quite as positive as you appear, but you don't want anyone to know. Thankfully, acting as if all is copacetic actually helps to manifest the emotional shift. But don't rush the process because it could take a few more days to make the energetic transition."
libra,2014-08-23,"You could be quite assertive today and more willing to go out on a limb so that others know what you want. It doesn't even matter if your chances of satisfaction are slim; it's less about the destination now than the journey. Nevertheless, your persistence might still lead to surprising results. In any case, just putting your feelings out in the open may be enough of a catalyst to make magic happen."
scorpio,2014-08-23,"Monitoring your schedule is crucial now because you might sacrifice more of your time than intended if you don't maintain solid boundaries. Fortunately, you are ready to take immediate action to regain control of your life. However, others may see your unorthodox behavior as erratic. Don't be concerned about anyone's judgments; consider what you need first and build the rest of your schedule around your priorities. The good news is once you nurture yourself you will have even more to give to those you love."
sagittarius,2014-08-23,"Although you crave your personal freedom at any cost, there still may be a hidden price to pay today for having things your way. Although you're willing to jump through the necessary hoops, others might not support your agenda now. It's honorable to give those you love the benefit of the doubt but their lack of enthusiasm bothers you. Don't let your annoyance fester or it could turn into something worse. Expressing your truth a little at a time is healthier than letting your anger take control."
capricorn,2014-08-23,You can see a relationship meltdown in the making and may do your best to sidestep any sort of melodrama. But somehow you might be pulled into a complicated web of feelings anyhow. The tension is obvious but how to resolve it is not. Keep in mind you can't fix today's problems with a shortsighted approach. Concentrating on the horizon offers the best chance for finding the long-term solution you seek.
aquarius,2014-08-23,"It's really true that all things must pass, but why does it seem that the good times roll on so much faster than the rest? You might wish that relationships could always be lighthearted. But now comes the hard work of establishing depth of feeling, although the intensity makes you want to bolt. Nevertheless, stay with the process even if it's temporarily discomforting. An emotional metamorphosis brings new levels of intimacy if you give it a real chance."
pisces,2014-08-23,"You might try to ignore the practical considerations of your finances today, even if you make a big deal about wanting to attend to all the details. You could successfully delay the work in front of you, but reality won't take no for an answer now. You must manage your response by staying away from extremes. Whatever resistance you experience at first, it becomes easier to make a concrete plan once you start. Trust your common sense and you can't go wrong."
aries,2014-08-24,"You have so many plates spinning on sticks today that you can't keep up with all of them. Although the playful Leo Moon encourages you to stir up some fun, you could quickly realize that making time for yourself isn't going to be as easy as you thought. Nevertheless, you spontaneous Rams are able to respond to unforeseen circumstances better than anyone. However, before you accept a surprise invitation, consider what you may need to give up in order to add something else to your busy schedule. Choose quality over quantity and you can't go wrong."
taurus,2014-08-24,"It may feel like the perfect day to stay at home and focus on long overdue creative projects. Even if you decide to head out today, your daydreams follow you around everywhere you go. Your current need for social interaction conflicts with your desire for solitude now. Rather than attempting to choose between your inner and outer worlds, be present in both realms and see where your flexible approach takes you."
gemini,2014-08-24,"You're buzzing around like a bee without much to show for your work yet; however, you haven't lost sight of your larger goals. But your need for tangible results grows so insistent now that you might have to modify your schedule sooner than you wish. You know what you want to do but could run out of energy too soon. Stop wasting your precious time on superfluous distractions. Come back to the hive and focus on the real task at hand instead of escaping into the field of possibilities."
cancer,2014-08-24,"Dealing with a personal financial matter in a creative manner might bring you the positive results you seek. However, thinking too far outside of the box today could tumble your precarious house of cards. It's possible that you haven't thought your plan through as carefully as you should. Still, you may be able to find a way to maneuver around an obstacle that has prevented you from buying something you want. It's better to be safe than sorry; your current purchase is likely a smart move now as long as you're not fooling yourself."
leo,2014-08-24,"You're doing your best to keep your plans to yourself today, but people seem to know what you're thinking anyhow. Although you usually don't hide in the shadows, it's not like you  always want to broadcast your feelings on the evening news either. However, everyone is  reading your thoughts now as if they have been printed and pinned to your forehead. Nevertheless, there's no reason to avoid engaging with others, for the give and take can actually help you clarify what you truly want. Don't let your pride stop you from connecting with those you love."
virgo,2014-08-24,"You're not saying everything that's on your mind today and you have good reason for your secrecy. Other people may mistakenly believe that you're already telling the whole story, but that's merely a false assumption. Meanwhile, you realize that it's more advantageous to circumvent a conflict now than it is to reveal all your true emotions. Enjoy the twists and turns of your thoughts without feeling the need to rock the boat."
libra,2014-08-24,"You may believe you are at a point of no return, but you can't put your finger on anything unusual that's happening right now. Nevertheless, you might need to make a decision within the next few days that could have long-lasting impact on your earning power. You're extremely optimistic about the eventual outcome, but could be seriously concerned about the immediate future. Don't let the weight of your current responsibilities negatively influence the potential for success."
scorpio,2014-08-24,"Handling an internal conflict between your head and your heart is likely quite familiar to you. Logically, you know what you should do today and are resigned to play your hand accordingly. But emotionally, you aren't as certain. There are aspects of your future that are quite appealing and you don't want to jeopardize what you already have in place. This is not the best time to turn everything upside down just because you are unsure of your path. Patience, grasshopper; clarity will arrive sooner than you expect."
sagittarius,2014-08-24,"Stepping into a leadership role is natural today because you could persuade others to join you on nearly any venture you conjure up. At first blush, relying on your charm seems like a great idea since you appear to be at the top of your game. However, real danger may be lurking in the shadows if you go off on an ill-conceived adventure with your entourage in tow. Stop yourself before you do something everyone might regret. Taking the right preventive medicine is healthier now than trying to manage the unpleasant symptoms that will manifest later on."
capricorn,2014-08-24,"You are not content to hang out splashing around in shallow waters today. You're being called into the deeper mysteries, where spiritual meaning overshadows the primacy of reality itself. This journey may not be an easy one; an old emotional wound might come back to haunt you when you least expect it. Healing can occur on many levels if you are willing to accept a surprise visitation from your past as a blessing in disguise."
aquarius,2014-08-24,"Nearly everything you do creates an immediate reaction now with three planets clustered in your 7th House of Relationships. But the responses you receive from others aren't necessarily what you expect. You need to manage things as they happen, even if it takes time and energy from previously scheduled activities. Don't try to stick to a predetermined timetable; as frustrated as you might be by the distractions, there may not be much you can do to change the course of events today. Relaxing the reigns of control helps to ease the tension for everyone involved."
pisces,2014-08-24,"There's no escaping into familiar fantasies today because you have important responsibilities to fulfill. Nevertheless, no one can take away your irrepressible desire to dream. It's just that you're continually snapped back into the real world each time you drift away, for there are pressing issues that demand your attention. The deadlines are real, so stay on task as much as possible now. Hang in there; thankfully, the current sense of urgency will begin to fade after tomorrow's New Moon."
aries,2014-08-25,"You're eager to explore new territory, but the cautious Virgo New Moon falls in your 6th House of Habits, holding you back until you have enough information to make an informed decision. Unfortunately, initiating change is impossible if you are too attached to your old routine. Thankfully, you could successfully launch a new project if you can pursue your unconventional ideas in a controlled manner. Your frustration with delays could dissipate quickly once you accept the limitations of your current circumstances and demonstrate your willingness to work within them."
taurus,2014-08-25,"You must be extra attentive to other people's feelings now if you want your relationships to grow this week. You might believe that rules are for everyone else except you while your key planet Venus resonates with rebellious Uranus. Although the Virgo New Moon dances in your 5th House of Love and Creativity, an authority figure might sweep in and rain on your parade. But if you're willing to put in the extra effort, you could be rewarded with a magical experience. Keep up the good work; finding pleasure is easier when you're doing something of value."
gemini,2014-08-25,"You want all your plans to unfold perfectly today, but your disappointment won't likely show if the results of your work fall short of your expectations. The exacting Virgo New Moon influences your 4th House of Security, pressuring you to reconsider the details of your schedule one more time. But even with plenty of preparation, you still won't be able to anticipate what happens next. Letting go of your preconceived notions eases your worry while also adding an edge of excitement to your day. Spontaneity is your friend."
cancer,2014-08-25,"You can't allow distractions to pull you off course today because people are depending on you to deliver on your promises. However, the pace of events and the variety of interactions in your life are on the upswing as the Virgo New Moon activates your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. Practicing self-discipline will help you accomplish your goals, but don't close yourself off to the amazing growth you could experience if you meander off the beaten path for a while. Not all those who wander are lost."
leo,2014-08-25,"You may feel as if you're in harmony with your core beliefs now that the pragmatic Virgo New Moon triggers your 2nd House of Self-Worth. However, your strong convictions can pit your will against someone else who is also passionate about his or her beliefs. Don't act so cocky that you miss a perfect opportunity to appreciate a variety of perspectives. Gentle yet persistent self-exploration is exactly what the doctor ordered today; just remember to listen as much as you speak."
virgo,2014-08-25,"You could be entangled in an internal argument about whether to move forward and deepen an existing commitment now or to head off in an entirely new direction. Today's reactive New Moon in your competent sign stimulates your 1st House of Personality, marking a turning point in how you relate to others. Although you may consider making sudden changes, ultimately your analytical approach enables you to see a a myriad of alternative outcomes to your current situation. Entertain all the possibilities before selecting the best one to pursue with unwavering passion."
libra,2014-08-25,"You have a lot to gain by tuning into your imagination today. The orderly Virgo New Moon energizes your 12th House of Fantasy, inspiring you to imagine the most creative scenarios possible. Meanwhile, romantic Venus is busy spicing up your relationship life and fueling your desires. Paradoxically, making a schedule and adhering to it gives you the time to follow your dreams. Excitement abounds now, so it is important to keep centering yourself while anticipating the fun ahead."
scorpio,2014-08-25,"You are often a force to be reckoned with because you are absolutely fixed in your purpose. In fact, you're not likely to bend to someone else's demands today, regardless of the pressure. You have your own trajectory and, if necessary, will fly solo into the future. But self-doubt might surface because the analytical Virgo New Moon intensifies your 11th House of Groups, prompting you to question whether or not you can find satisfaction on your own. Nevertheless, your willingness to break away from the crowd to express your individuality is your current key to success."
sagittarius,2014-08-25,"Your words have such a powerful impact today that you need to be careful how you use them. Today's rational Virgo New Moon occupies your 10th House of Authority, demanding that you acknowledge your role within your community or at your workplace. Others place a lot of stock in what you say now, even if you secretly lack self-confidence. Although exercising caution may be the smartest way to steer clear of trouble, you might be willing to sacrifice peace in order to add more adventure into your life."
capricorn,2014-08-25,"Although your self-restraint is legendary, it may be a struggle to stay out of trouble today. A cosmic drama is playing out in your life as you overcome the obstacles standing between you and success. The Virgo New Moon lands in your 9th House of Adventure, encouraging you to dream of grandiose schemes and exotic places. But a Mars-Saturn hookup requires you to take your foot off the accelerator before you lose control of the wheel. Fortunately, making concrete plans now can better your chances of reaching your destination later on."
aquarius,2014-08-25,"You have more than your fair share of practical thinking to do today if you're in the process of buying a home, car or some other jointly owned property. Don't rush into making any sort of investment on a whim because a promising purchase could quickly turn sour unless you are diligent in your research. The Virgo New Moon stirs your 8th House of Shared Resources, making relationship dynamics more complicated. A calculated risk may work in your advantage, but there are no free lunches now. You must put in the blood, sweat and tears if you want to reap the rewards."
pisces,2014-08-25,"If you are waiting for the right moment to share something that's been on your mind, don't skirt around the edges any longer. You have thought about what you want to say long enough. However, the picky Virgo New Moon's presence in your 7th House of Relationships could indicate that others are overly critical about your words. Thankfully, you can tilt the odds in your favor by being fully prepared for any response. Just be sure to balance your need to be heard with your willingness to take the feedback you receive to heart."
aries,2014-08-26,"Someone you love might seem to throw an obstacle in your path to happiness today. Your very first impulse when you encounter trouble is usually to push, kick and fight with whatever appears to be in your way. Now, however, your anger could make things worse and beating yourself up won't get you anywhere at all. Instead, your healthiest option is to slow down, treat everyone with kindness and learn from the situation rather than trying to power your way through it."
taurus,2014-08-26,"Just as you start to grow comfortable with your place in a relationship, there seems to be a hurdle in your way. You are likely taking yourself way too seriously today, and this sobering tone hampers your spontaneity. Unfortunately, you can't just talk yourself into being lighthearted. Your best course of action now is to stop fighting your emotions. The current cooling of affections you might be experiencing is just a temporary phase. However, the sooner you adjust to the new reality, the quicker your playful attitude will return."
gemini,2014-08-26,"You may be shadowboxing today as you struggle to complete your chores. You strive to focus all your attention on the work at hand, but too many responsibilities make it nearly impossible to finish, even if you put in extra hours. Although you can multitask with the best of them, your schedule can grow overwhelming unless you step back and sort out your priorities. A bit of alone time might be all you need to get back on track."
cancer,2014-08-26,"You are usually hesitant about sharing too much personal information too quickly in a new relationship. Trust is a significant issue for you, especially when you're afraid of being hurt or used by others. Your caution works to your advantage today as reality impedes your forward movement. Reconsider recent events and rethink your current plans. Wait a few more days if possible before announcing your final decision so you have enough time to process your feelings."
leo,2014-08-26,"It takes a lot to bring you strong Lions down, but even a disagreement with someone you love won't keep you down long. Don't get too discouraged if others are judging you harshly. There's little justification in feeling defeated, for today's reactions will have major impact on your immediate future. Keep in mind that you aren't the only person ever to get sent back to the drawing board. Turn your disappointment into an opportunity by carefully re-evaluating and re-adjusting your plans. Your natural resilience is one of your greatest strengths."
virgo,2014-08-26,"Your secret desires might go unfulfilled today, blocking your natural expression of energy. Circumstances could appear rather discouraging, especially if you don't have enough money or resources to follow your dreams. Even if you lower your expectations, you still may feel that nothing is moving along fast enough. Your patience is being tested now more than ever; being grateful for the little things changes your entire perspective."
libra,2014-08-26,"A friend may be on your case for no apparent reason. Or, you might feel a financial squeeze so strongly now that you are ready to scream. Regardless of how you experience Saturn's pressure on your key planet Venus today, there are plenty of things to do to turn the negativity around. Fortunately, you can facilitate positive change by courageously facing issues instead of trying to avoid them. Chin up; even if circumstances seem challenging, something is likely to improve very soon."
scorpio,2014-08-26,"Planning for the future now could seem more like work than play, but this responsible approach doesn't mean you can't enjoy yourself anyhow. Oddly enough, you may not realize how much control you have over your current situation. All you need to do is change your mind and you can take some time off for rest and relaxation before you even know it. A bit of downtime will leave you feeling refreshed and ready for another round. Pace yourself; achieving your goals is more like a marathon than a sprint."
sagittarius,2014-08-26,"You Archers are often so accomplished at seeing the larger picture that sometimes you miss an important detail along the way. Although you may be dealing with the results of your own previous careless behavior, the outcome might not be as bad as you think. But you still have a challenge on your hands if you are going to set things right. Allowing time for meditation and other spiritual practices can help you manage your mundane responsibilities with a healthier attitude and a more compassionate touch."
capricorn,2014-08-26,"When the circumstances start getting tough and the weak of heart surrender, you motivated Mountain Goats are ambitiously scheming to take over the world. However, you may be overwhelmed by your own aspirations now as you begin to realize the complexity of your chosen path. Nevertheless, don't succumb to doubt; tackle any and all obstacles head on. Your optimism will be rewarded as long as you also keep your shoulder to the wheel and never lose sight of your dreams."
aquarius,2014-08-26,"You are preoccupied with the unrealistic expectations of your boss or partner today, which can make you quite frustrated. However, you're more likely to take care of your own needs once you admit you can't miraculously produce what others want in one day. Remember, there's more to life than instant gratification. The finer things are often well worth the wait. Your willingness to compromise makes everyone happier in the long run."
pisces,2014-08-26,"Listening to others now is the key to your success, especially if you lack clarity about your next step. Much of the resistance you're currently meeting may actually be your own, even if it appears to come from someone else. Take any advice you receive today very seriously because it can help you overcome your self-imposed limits. Free your mind and the rest will fall into place."
aries,2014-08-27,"You are more aware of everyone else's needs once the reflective Moon takes up residence in your 7th House of Companions. Putting your desires aside comes naturally now in order to make sure that others are at ease. However, your patience is tested today as flirty Venus teases your key planet Mars, provoking you to be more assertive in your quest for personal satisfaction. Channel your energy into creative pursuits, instead of letting frustration get the best of you. You'll be happier in the long run if you simply let your inner child out to play."
taurus,2014-08-27,"You might believe you have too many chores on your plate today and worry that you cannot possibly finish all of them. Although you intend to meet your obligations, you're also tempted by your wish to spend time with someone special. You have been anxiously waiting for this moment and you're eager to connect on a deeper level. However, being responsible in the outer world is in direct conflict now with fulfilling your desires. Balance is key; make an extra effort to honor your current need for both work and play."
gemini,2014-08-27,"You have been taking life far too seriously long enough and are anticipating nothing but good times today. However, it may not be that simple to escape from the burden of work. The Moon's shift into your 5th House of Frivolity gives you the impression you can temporarily avoid difficult issues. However, bossy Saturn won't let you lighten up too quickly unless you respect your commitments. Don't begrudge the life lessons you're learning now since they will put you in good stead for the exciting opportunities ahead."
cancer,2014-08-27,"You wish you could be more objective today in your pursuit of love, but your strong judgments entangle you in uncomfortable relationship dynamics. You may be able to regain your equilibrium later in the day by remembering to balance your subjectivity with cool logic, but your personal interactions might still be a bit unfulfilling now. Instead of retreating emotionally, tell others what you want. You have to step outside of your comfort zone and express your needs; you'll never know what can happen unless you try."
leo,2014-08-27,"You might assume you missed your recent chance to receive the personal satisfaction that you seek. Acting impulsively may seem like your best strategy now as you grasp for the possibility of pleasure. Nevertheless, sobering Saturn isn't far from the picture today, requiring you to attend to immediate obligations first. Being flexible isn't easy once you've made up your mind, but changing your schedule allows you to accommodate both your emotional and practical needs. A minor modification to your calendar can make all the difference in the world."
virgo,2014-08-27,"Playing hooky sounds like a great idea in theory but it won't be so easy to pull off your plan today. Even if you have a bullet-proof scheme up your sleeve, you still may need to re-evaluate your priorities and save the fun and games for another day. Instead, concentrate your energy on either bringing in additional money or cutting back expenses. Managing your resources efficiently is more important now than the pursuit of pleasure."
libra,2014-08-27,"You can turn a challenging situation to your advantage today. However, you may have to fight to get what you want as resourceful Venus squares off with warrior Mars. Under normal conditions you might choose a peaceful strategy, but you're too impatient now for diplomatic gestures. People seem to be looking to you for solutions, but you're at your wit's end because you don't have any advice to give. Although it feels like your job is to please everyone all the time, it's not. Take the time to figure out your own needs before doing anything else."
scorpio,2014-08-27,"Reaching your destination is an uphill climb if your current direction isn't aligned with your true desires. It may be that your chosen path -- professionally or romantically -- isn't bringing you happiness and you don't know how to change things for the better. Instead of worrying about a lack of emotional fulfillment, focus on what you can do to spread hope and love today. Concentrating on creating positive energy works wonders as it resonates and returns to you many times over."
sagittarius,2014-08-27,"Your responsibilities may seem overwhelming now, but your attitude quickly improves if you simply step back from your work and reassess your long-term goals. This review process isn't about setting a new course of action yet; there will be time for that later. It's sufficient to simply acknowledge that you're being pulled in conflicting directions. Consider several different scenarios without picking any particular one today. Explore your options, but wait to narrow your path until you have more clarity about your destination."
capricorn,2014-08-27,"If you've been in an emotional funk lately, today could be a significant turning point. You might feel as if you're an outsider because your desires deviate significantly from your friends and coworkers, but your priorities are not up for negotiation. Nevertheless, don't let your differences interfere with making important decisions; setting aside your personal feelings is the right thing to do now. However, self-restraint is effective only if it comes from a place of deep conviction and not a sense of obligation. Let your moral compass be your guide."
aquarius,2014-08-27,"You might be wondering if you're doing something wrong because everyone except you seems to be having more fun today. However, the good news is you're making more progress toward achieving your goals than you realize. Whether or not you recognize it yet, you are rounding a corner and will soon be moving in a new direction. Don't let self-doubt creep into your life or you could close down during this critical time. It may take a while to find your balance, so stretch your wings slowly and wait to see where they carry you."
pisces,2014-08-27,"Although close partnerships may be on your mind today, you're not satisfied with simply meeting your commitments. You want to increase the intensity and depth in your intimate interactions, and won't be completely satisfied until you do. But don't place all your hopes in one basket or you could miss out on the possible pleasure that's right in front of your nose. Cultivating your relationships methodically creates the environment necessary for the kind of emotional connections you crave."
aries,2014-08-28,"Your closest friends may get on your nerves today if they won't hurry up and make up their minds. You want answers now and can quickly grow annoyed if your impatience gets the best of you. Much to your chagrin, no one else seems to share your heightened sense of urgency. The whole situation becomes more manageable once you admit that the problem is really about your needs and not about everyone else's shortcomings. Do yourself a favor; lighten up and give others room to be themselves just as you would want in return."
taurus,2014-08-28,"Others might be bewildered by your lack of motivation today, even though you have specific chores that still require your attention. However, you may not feel the need to jump in and take care of your responsibilities before heading out for a little fun. Nevertheless, it's wise to pay attention to your obligations because you can't let loose and enjoy yourself if you don't honor your commitments. However, taking the time to reconnect with your dreams enables you to tap into your passion and inspires you to be your best."
gemini,2014-08-28,"Looking forward to an easygoing day is natural when the Moon is reflecting the needs of your 5th House of Fun and Games. However, there is so much going on in your life now, you may not have sufficient time to pursue the various options for entertainment. But don't take your frustration out on others; even if there's something blocking your progress, it isn't about anyone else's actions. Ultimately, changing your own attitude is the most expedient way to overcome the external resistance you feel today. People are taking their cues from you so lead with your best foot forward."
cancer,2014-08-28,"Although you may not know exactly how to handle a family matter today, your uncertainty does not come from your indifference. To the contrary, you're so preoccupied with events in your personal life that you see all the pros and cons of each possible solution. You might even reach a point of frustration and are tempted to walk away from the whole mess. Don't sell yourself short by quitting; just make the best choice you can, even if you aren't one hundred percent certain about your decision. Any positive action now is better than doing nothing at all."
leo,2014-08-28,"You may choose to play the role of the noble diplomat today, positioning yourself between two other people who are in the throes of a disagreement. Thankfully, you're able to listen to both versions of the story while maintaining your neutrality. Keep in mind, you aren't the final arbiter of truth and justice. Instead, you are more effective now if you can simply help the conflicted parties establish a piece of common ground on which to stand."
virgo,2014-08-28,"You aren't as in touch with your feelings today as you were over the past few days when the evocative Moon was camping out in your sign. Thankfully, your innate critical thinking can lead you in the most sensible direction. However, lowering your high standards is not part of your strategy for success. You don't have to be overly judgmental and say no to nearly every new idea that comes your way; instead, allow for the element of surprise. Embracing the unknown increases the potential for magic to occur."
libra,2014-08-28,"You should be able to continue working toward your personal goals today if you're able to integrate your needs into a social context. The Moon's current visit to your sign might overwhelm you with contradictory feelings. Thankfully, you may be certain enough about your position that you can easily go along with nearly any group decision. Unfortunately, someone could assume that your willingness to yield is a sign of weakness. Don't bother trying to convince others that they are wrong. Keep your integrity intact and those who matter most will shift their assumptions over time."
scorpio,2014-08-28,"You are ready to throw off the shackles of self-restraint and share a secret or two today. However, telling the entire story isn't necessary since you like to keep some things private. However, you certainly don't want to come across as ambivalent, so you might just choose a side and then remain loyal to whatever you pick. Ultimately, it doesn't matter if you are right; what's more important now is that you listen to your heart."
sagittarius,2014-08-28,"Hanging out in the summer sun with your friends sounds like a perfect plan for the day. Happily, connecting with like-minded people is actually nourishment for your soul. However, you're not as eager to relinquish control of your feelings today. Ironically, everyone else might assume you have your life more together than you actually do. This is tricky territory; others may not be willing to help you later on when you really need it if you don't show some vulnerability now. It's great to have fun, but sometimes it's better to just be real."
capricorn,2014-08-28,"You feel as if everyone expects you to pull the right answers out of thin air; however, you're tired of being taken for granted and may not be willing to play their games now. Although you take pride in being an authority figure, you're just not as concerned with choosing one solution over another today. What's most critical now is staying true to your core values; leading by example is the most effective way to get your message across."
aquarius,2014-08-28,"Nearly everything in your life seems to work well up to a point today. Even if you are executing a well-conceived plan, you still must be ready to set it aside if circumstances change suddenly. Instead of attempting to make a sprint for the finish line, take your time and handle any obstacles that pop up along the way. Keep your impatience in check; slow and steady wins the race."
pisces,2014-08-28,"You're interested in getting to the bottom of an emotional issue now that could come between you and the intimacy you seek. However, discussing your attractions and desires is not sufficient to deepen the bond on its own. It's no fun talking  about your feelings when you're scared of losing your rational perspective. Nevertheless, you're standing on safer ground today than you realize, so let your emotions wash over you without any fear of drowning. Exploring your heart isn't always easy but it's the fastest way to break on through to the other side."
aries,2014-08-29,"You could fall for your own story today, even if you know it's not quite true. Your tendency now is to embellish the truth to create the impact you want at work. Unfortunately, your delivery is so convincing, your charming words might get you into more trouble than it's worth. Thankfully, you have the power to monitor what you say before you open your mouth. Enjoy the fruits of your imagination without thinking that you must share everything that comes to mind."
taurus,2014-08-29,"Although you might end up accomplishing a lot today, it's challenging to track your progress unless you establish clear goals from the start. Unfortunately, setting priorities doesn't come easily now and you could quickly exhaust yourself if you don't create sensible limits early in the day. Instead of trying to please everyone, say no to their enticing offers if the opportunities don't support your dreams. Ultimately, you can gain more respect for stating what you can't do than falling short of your unrealistic promises."
gemini,2014-08-29,"You may run into trouble for doing the wrong thing at work today, especially if you act in haste. Unfortunately, your good intentions only carry you so far if you receive ambiguous directions from your boss or some other authority figure. But even without clear guidance, you should be able to find your way as long as you take the time to put things in perspective. Consider all the possibilities before deciding what makes the most sense to do next."
cancer,2014-08-29,"Your natural ability to play it low key allows you to show up at work without revealing too much information about your personal life. Those who know you may believe that they can see the true you, but you might be turning on the charm in order to hide something you don't want to talk about. Nevertheless, your fear of being seen is likely based on a memory of a difficult experience rather than what's unfolding in your present life. Separating the truth from irrational worries frees you from repeating the past."
leo,2014-08-29,"You have a good sense of what you need to do in order to increase your income. However, your plans to make money today are probably less formed than your original idea. Nevertheless, your psychic powers are strong now and you might catch some glimpses of the future, even if they are not as clear as you wish. Be patient; a more practical perspective is already beginning to emerge. Blending your intuition with the facts empowers you to turn your dreams into reality."
virgo,2014-08-29,"You realize that you're in the middle of an internal battle, even if it continues to play out now in the realm of relationships. The ever-radiant Sun encourages you to express the love that's in your heart while its opposition to spiritual Neptune dissipates the boundaries that normally prevent you from going further. If you look to your friends for practical advice, they aren't of much help today because they just tell you to throw caution to the wind. Being brave is surely an admirable trait, but you may end up regretting your actions if you act foolishly."
libra,2014-08-29,"You want everyone to know that you're up for nearly anything the group decides to do today. You may even believe that it's more important now to support your friends and coworkers than it is to further your own personal agenda. Nevertheless, you also hope to enjoy yourself as much as anyone else. There's no need to be so fast to minimize your desires for the sake of the community. Although you're a valuable team player, you still need to establish your personal priorities separate from everyone else's."
scorpio,2014-08-29,"If someone doesn't support your plans today, you might overcompensate by strengthening your resolve. However, it's nearly impossible to understand why everyone else isn't more concerned about the future, and it makes you feel like you have to hold it all together. Instead of attempting to tighten your control on the world around you, it's smarter to loosen the reins for a while and see where journey takes you."
sagittarius,2014-08-29,"You're extra motivated to shine professionally now with the Sun lighting up your 10th House of Status. You believe you're doing a great job and want everyone to know about your superhuman efforts. You may feel as if a new set of priorities is replacing the old list of rules. Don't question your change in direction; just adapt to the shifting currents until you can get your bearings. You can always return to your previous agenda later on if you so choose. In the meantime, ride this wave of cosmic energy as far as you can."
capricorn,2014-08-29,"You might attempt to disregard your ever-changing emotions, but you don't seem to have a lot of control over your feelings now. You can feel the Libra Moon's tug as she diplomatically pulls you one way and then another in a process that ultimately finds the right balance. Let the winds carry you along because attempts to alter their direction may be fruitless. Take scenic routes and detours whenever possible today, for your horizons widen as soon as you step off the beaten path."
aquarius,2014-08-29,"You may be struggling to find your way in a close relationship now, even if everything appears copacetic to everyone else. You want the current tension to dissipate all by itself before messy emotions erupt. But unspoken issues still lurk beneath the surface, like a boogeyman in a nightmare waiting for you to relax and let down your guard. Keep shining the light of your awareness to bring up your fears where they can finally be put to rest."
pisces,2014-08-29,"A door to a beautiful place may open and close faster than you're able to walk through it today. Oddly enough, if you grab onto an opportunity, you still must wait a while until it begins to pay off. It might feel as if you have been here before; somehow, it seems like the wheels of time are turning backward. Nevertheless, keep looking ahead; it's the future that's calling and not the past."
aries,2014-08-30,"There's nothing you enjoy more than starting a new project, but you could run out of steam before you get very far today. You may be tired of spreading your resources too thin, especially if you aren't accomplishing as much as you expected. You don't want to wait another day or two to get back in the driver's seat again but you can't rush events that are beyond your control. Nevertheless, you can set a sustainable pace as you go about your business. There's no point worrying about things you can't change, anyway."
taurus,2014-08-30,"You are wise to get your chores done early in the day because you might be less inclined to work hard later in the afternoon. Don't worry if you fall behind on your original timetable. You can always get back in the groove by reclaiming your center and planting your feet firmly back on the ground. However, you can't depend on others to ride to your rescue now unless you're willing to demonstrate your unwavering commitment to achieving your goals."
gemini,2014-08-30,"Your sense of urgency is not the best indicator of good timing today, especially if you're secretly worried about an approaching deadline. Your natural tendency is to just run off and start something new in order to revitalize your life with some fresh excitement. However, you can't escape now until you finish what's already on your plate. Wait until some stability returns before adding anything else to the mix. In the meantime, simplify your life by tying up as many loose ends as you can."
cancer,2014-08-30,"You're feeling an extra boost of confidence today because you know that you have the final say over your schedule. Although you typically prefer to retreat when life gets hectic, you are eager to engage the energy head-on now. However, you might reach a point when you realize that you have taken on more than you can manage, making these next few days quite an intense ride. In all the whirlwind of activity, one thing is certain now: this could be an awesome chance to experience the full passion of life."
leo,2014-08-30,"You can hold steady in the midst of an emotional storm, even while you're running through a variety of scenarios in anticipation of future events. You are naturally adept at handling intense feelings, but there could be a severe learning curve looming on the horizon. Withdrawing your energy from social activities and refocusing on home and family matters for a few days may be all that's needed to realign your balance. Even you courageous Lions need a bit of downtime to rest and recharge for the challenges of life."
virgo,2014-08-30,"Don't allow any distractions to hook you today or you could quickly be pulled off course. You're inspired by your own dreams and feel as if you are on a mission now, so you may appear quite single-minded to those around you. Passionately engaging  in the creative process is good for your soul, but cool your emotions with sound logic. Don't spend too much energy justifying your actions or you could waste precious time and lose your opportunity to make something wonderful happen."
libra,2014-08-30,"You can try to cling to your neutral position with all your might but something has to give now. You intuitively understand that it's time to make your move once the Moon enters incisive Scorpio today and ambiguity quickly becomes a thing of the past. You know exactly where you stand and have no doubt about your destination. Your strength of conviction could seem out of place, but you feel as if your core values are at stake. Others are wise to follow your lead or just get out of your way."
scorpio,2014-08-30,"It probably takes more effort to bury your feelings today than to just go ahead and express them. The Moon's monthly return to your provocative sign isn't always an easy process because it brings your passions right up to the surface. Your heightened emotions can be rather overwhelming to those around you. However, you have a chance to strengthen a close relationship if you're willing to reveal your heart. Fortunately, intimacy is within reach once you demonstrate your vulnerability and let others past your defenses."
sagittarius,2014-08-30,"You are usually a straight shooter with your feelings, but that doesn't mean you like to dwell on them. You normally prefer to let your actions speak for your heart, but you might actually have something to hide today. If you want to take the focus off of your inner process now, there's plenty of interesting topics to discuss other than your emotions. Talking about recent developments at work or sharing your long-range career objectives reduces the pressure and shifts the emphasis to something less personal."
capricorn,2014-08-30,"It's possible to delay an inevitable confrontation for a day or two, but it isn't advisable if you want to find a peaceful resolution. Suppressing your emotions now could trigger a meltdown so you might as well face them sooner than later. It might seem as if you are hitting the proverbial wall today, but this could be a projection of your inner turmoil. Surprisingly, when you stop trying to control everything in your environment, your stress will  dissipate on its own and you might just discover that your fears are for naught."
aquarius,2014-08-30,"You feel obligated to nurture everyone's goals at work today, but you may have to set aside your own feelings in the process. Unfortunately, it's all too easy for your unexpressed resistance to turn into anger or resentment -- which doesn't help you get along with anyone. Nevertheless, latching onto a ray of hope can be enough to encourage you not to lose confidence. Focusing on the myriad of possibilities ahead just might be enough to keep you in a positive frame of mind."
pisces,2014-08-30,"You may feel energetically reserved today, even if your hopes are pinned to a shooting star that's on its way upward and outward. Nevertheless, your intensity can become disproportionately dramatic when you finally break down and tell your story. Tread carefully; everything doesn't need to come out in the open all at once. This is an emotional journey and if you move along the path gracefully, your gradual metamorphosis will be less stressful for everyone involved. Buckle your seat-belt and enjoy the ride."
aries,2014-08-31,"If your plans go awry today, it could remind you of other times in your personal history that have caused you heartache. Old heartaches may return to haunt you and you cannot make them go away by simply sweeping them back under the rug. Yet, you can resolve the present predicament by revisiting the pain of your past. However, it's important to discern which is which so you're clear about what you want in your future."
taurus,2014-08-31,"You could receive recognition for a job well done today if you successfully rise to meet a challenge. However, your current stress is more than just about about work as love and relationships are also in the mix.

Thankfully, taking your obligations seriously enables you to concentrate on what's real. Achieving tangible results is more important now than nearly anything else."
gemini,2014-08-31,"You are on an intellectual trip now, exploring a variety of creative pursuits. However, you can't ignore the undefinable ripples that defy analysis as they come floating across your pond today. As hard as you may try, you simply can't put the essence of your experience into words. Appreciate the present moment for all that it holds; sometimes the things which cannot be said are the most magical of all."
cancer,2014-08-31,"It's nearly impossible to hold back a stream of big ideas that flood your consciousness today. You may be tempted by the possibility of something that hasn't yet demonstrated real potential, but this uncertainty probably won't stop you from taking chances. Although you might not want to travel to a foreign country or a distant galaxy, visualizing a wild adventure now could bring you a much-needed sense of freedom. Explore the alternatives by indulging in your fantasies. The good news is that you can always pick the most promising scenario and develop a game plan to make your dream come true."
leo,2014-08-31,"You wish you could be objective in your interactions with others, but it's challenging to play the role of an unbiased observer. Complex emotional issues emerge from the depths of your subconscious now, pressuring you to immediately do something about them. Perhaps you feel like you must rush in to save the day. Act on your intuition, but remember that practicing compassion is more important than being a hero. Trust your heart to know the difference."
virgo,2014-08-31,"Your energy continues to oscillate like a pendulum today. This could draw you into a conflict that stems from a difference of perspective rather than an incompatibility of goals. It's likely that both parties want the same result, even if it's not readily apparent now. Use your analytical powers to establish common ground and work together from there. Taking the high road invites a cooperative approach to finding a healthy resolution."
libra,2014-08-31,"In spite of your intense emotions today, you're probably feeling confident about everything that's going on. However, your optimism may suddenly waver for reasons you don't completely understand. You would rather remain aloof and prefer not to express your desires in the heat of passion. Remember, you can always retreat if you want some time alone. A little solitude and quiet contemplation could be just what you need to heal."
scorpio,2014-08-31,"There is a familiar comfort to your spiritual life these days, regardless of the challenges you may be facing in the outer world. You're often able to close the door to your subconscious when it presents you with difficult material. However, images just trickle into your awareness now in symbolic messages that you can somehow decipher. Keep the channel open; trusting the guidance of your inner voice allows you to find the missing pieces of your future."
sagittarius,2014-08-31,"Protecting your feelings is top priority today, but this strategy can be confusing if your emotions are in discord with your actions. This lack of clarity isn't as bad as it sounds as you might grow more philosophical when your head and heart aren't aligned. Make sure that you work out the general principles now and then address the specific issues later as they arise. Approaching your problems with a healthy sense of humor might just give you the fresh perspective you need."
capricorn,2014-08-31,"You can't afford to be lazy today just because you believe that something will work out to your advantage. Being diligent and taking care of your obligations increases your chances for success. Although you may be quite realistic about your long-term goals, you still might feel insecure about your social life. Thankfully, a little communication goes a long way now. Just say what's on your mind; there's no reason to hold back, even if you're afraid of being too serious. Everyone will feel better once you clear the air and speak your piece."

Just remember, facts take you only so far now. You can visualize whatever you want to do next; just sketch in the basics and let your imagination do the rest."
pisces,2014-08-31,"Your need for an adrenaline rush is at odds with a deeper desire for emotional security today. Even if you're quite lucky when it comes to taking risks, your friends and associates will probably advise you to play it safe by maintaining the status quo. They may be right; assuming the role of a responsible adult today allows your spirit to shine brightly in a more compassionate way."
aries,2014-09-01,"Finding emotional satisfaction may be elusive today if your anger gets the best of you. Whatever you can do to manage your stress should be considered because blaming others will only push them further away. Something as simple as a morning walk or run could be enough to do the trick. Fortunately, the dynamics grow less complicated, making it easier to handle difficult feelings as the day goes on. Once you're back on track, you might just make the personal breakthrough you have been hoping for all along."
taurus,2014-09-01,"You're moving very carefully today, as if you are walking on eggshells. But it's difficult to treat others gently if you feel like they are attempting to instigate a fight. There's no reason to avoid confrontation now, but don't start something unless you're sure you want to fully engage in battle. However, it might be more beneficial for you to wage peace in your personal life, not war. Take the high road and see who follows."
gemini,2014-09-01,"Everyone seems on edge today, yet you can dance your way through emotional minefields with apparent ease. However, your graceful appearance is misleading because it hides your inner angst. Unfortunately, burying your anxiety might just cause it to pop up at inconvenient moments when you least expect it. The best way to soothe your nerves is to talk about your feelings instead of suppressing them. Sharing your story with someone you trust makes all the difference in the world."
cancer,2014-09-01,"The time has come to bring your secret resentments out into the open. Thankfully, you have a chance to improve the uncomfortable dynamics at work today, but it requires planning and courage to make it happen. You can emerge a superhero if you're willing to approach an old problem from an entirely new direction. Acknowledging your feelings without trying to blame them on anyone else is a good way to start the conversation. You don't have to express all your emotions at once; you just need to get the ball rolling."
leo,2014-09-01,"It seems as if your most noble intentions are being thwarted by someone, but you may not be able to figure out who is behind the resistance. Ironically, you might suddenly realize that the obstacles in your path originate within you. Instead of lashing out at the wrong target, try to understand what you are doing that makes others annoyed with you now. You can't always change external circumstances, but you can modify your response to a tricky situation today. Assuming responsibility for your role allows both parties to move on."
virgo,2014-09-01,"Your current apprehension may evolve into a minor temper tantrum today, especially if you are overwhelmed by your unexpressed feelings. You might try connecting with someone on a deeper level, only to find that the other person isn't as accessible as you thought. Instead of pushing boundaries now, find a suitable channel of expression for your physical energies. Participating in a team sport or some other competitive activity is the perfect antidote to your stress. Exerting yourself is not only good for the body; it's good for the soul."
libra,2014-09-01,"Someone's selfish behavior may trigger a surprisingly strong response from you today. On the other hand, you might choose to emotionally withdraw, yet your intense feelings won't likely diminish in power. You could even grow more frustrated since a straightforward solution doesn't seem readily available. Instead of making things worse by losing your cool, take a few deep breaths before saying anything. Once you regain your center, just tell the truth as diplomatically as you can."
scorpio,2014-09-01,"You might try to hold back the flood of impassioned feelings this morning, but it may take an extraordinary amount of self-restraint.

But in the meantime, invoke a bit of Scorpio magic by transmuting dark negativity into illuminating love."
sagittarius,2014-09-01,"Although you might wake up with high hopes, today could get off to a slow start. Thankfully, your momentum picks up midday once the Moon returns to your fiery sign. Unfortunately, you may be holding onto frustration from earlier in the day when it was painful to express your emotions.

You might have to take a chance and speak your truth to find out if it will bring down the walls that are keeping you from experiencing a deeper intimacy. No risk, no reward."
capricorn,2014-09-01,"If someone pushes you too hard today, they may be surprised how strongly you push back. Unfortunately, your behavior can be disruptive because your patience is worn thin and your certainty is high. Even the most insignificant event could be a catalyst that provokes your fiery response now. But you have more control over your feelings than you realize; don't react too quickly or you might undo your recent gains. Keep your ultimate goal in sight while exercising a bit of your legendary Capricorn self-restraint."
aquarius,2014-09-01,"Withholding your feelings is only a temporary strategy at best, but one that can serve you well today. The impact of your current actions may be out of proportion with your intent; whatever you do now seems to affect others in a direct and immediate manner. What you don't say is just as important as what is shared, so it's wise to think twice about the consequences of your words before speaking your mind. Practicing discretion is more for your benefit than anyone else's."
pisces,2014-09-01,"You may be riding a rising wave of anger today that stems from a clash of values you have endured too long. You are in touch with a wide range of shifting emotions now, some of which could be challenging to manage. Concentrate your awareness on your inner process rather than the outer events. Making time for meditation is healthier than being at the mercy of events you cannot control. Once you have reestablished peace in your kingdom, you can share your feelings in a more positive way."
aries,2014-09-02,"An unexpected conversation may add uncertainty to your day, revealing perspectives that don't support your current plans. Unfortunately, the dilemma you are now facing will not simply fade away. Larger patterns are being established that can influence your success throughout the month. Sticking close to your original agenda is your best strategy as you won't be lured off course by someone else's ideas. Focus on what matters if you want to see results."
taurus,2014-09-02,"Although you are usually sure of your direction once you have made up your mind, it's a different story today. You may continue to engage in a debate within the private recesses of your mind long after you have arrived at an answer. Fortunately, there's no reason to reduce the current issues to black and white even if you're feeling the pressure to do so. Just listen carefully to all the voices without trying to silence any of them. Perfecting the right blend of logic and creativity serves you well."
gemini,2014-09-02,"Your natural ability to think on your feet is on point today, so put whatever you know to good use. The only fault in your logic that may cloud your perceptive intellect is a result of taking yourself too seriously. It really doesn't matter how crucial you believe your work to be, don't muddy the waters with big ideas about your self-importance. You might be pleasantly surprised at how much you can enjoy the day once you put your priorities in proper perspective."
cancer,2014-09-02,"You may feel out of sorts now that the moody Moon is moving through extroverted Sagittarius. Even the most lighthearted interaction could become more complicated today, especially if your search for meaning becomes blown out of proportion. There aren't any simple answers if your irrational emotions clash with your rational thoughts, making it more difficult to trust them. Luckily, you can rely on your intuition when the facts don't give you the information you need."
leo,2014-09-02,"You might want more change than is possible now; however, there's no cause for alarm if circumstances don't appear to support your desires. Whatever you do, keep in mind that it's futile to row against the tide and expect that you can arrive at your destination any sooner. Your efforts will only be frustrated if you aren't patient. Weigh all the factors prior to making your next move and just let reality flow at its own rate. Discerning the difference between what you can change and what you can't is the key to your current success."
virgo,2014-09-02,"You may get clarity now on a situation that you were previously too close  to see. You could already miss the presence of your key planet Mercury in your analytical sign, but over-thinking a problem doesn't necessarily lead to a solution. So say goodbye to mischievous Mercury as it enters even-keeled Libra. You might have to face a bit of unpleasantness as you readjust to your new reality. Nevertheless,after you make the necessary modifications you can move on with a clear conscience."
libra,2014-09-02,"You're eager to experience an intellectual rebirth now that cerebral Mercury breezes into your sign, bringing along his bag of clever trickster rationalizations. However, you must be careful of slipping into emotional detachment. You might believe that you are relying on your clear judgment, but your heart could have its own opinion that stands outside of logic. Don't try to force a single answer today; the best solution will reveal itself in time."
scorpio,2014-09-02,"Sometimes you believe that your life would be less complicated if your reactions weren't so emotionally intense, but this isn't necessarily true. The depth of your passions is one of your greatest strengths. However, you're receiving new information from your subconscious mind now that can temporarily throw a wrench into the works. Don't resist your current flow of awareness, for soon you will better understand your feelings. Trust your intuition and let the process take its course."
sagittarius,2014-09-02,"You are all fired up about your future, but can also see the limitations of your current plans. This dualistic thinking might even prompt you to execute an absolute about-face on a previous strategy. You can clearly see both sides of the issue once you turn around, making your ultimate decision even tougher. Don't settle on any quick fixes now; you are better off holding out for a viable long-term solution. The right formula for success is yours if you're willing to wait."
capricorn,2014-09-02,"There is a shift of power subtly transforming your life, though it may take weeks to fully manifest. Nevertheless, today's choices could play an important role in the upcoming changes, especially with respect to your career path. Just don't let the uncontrollable aspects of your life take over the rest of it. Managing a minor crisis now with finesse brings you much closer to realizing your goals."
aquarius,2014-09-02,"You might not possess a lot of patience today if something is blocking you on the way to your destination. Naturally, advanced planning is useful in managing the obstacles in front of you, but don't bother trying to overpower the impediments because coercion just won't work. Conquering your environment will not help your cause, either. Instead, you need to learn how to work in harmony with your surroundings. Cooperating with the cosmic rhythms is more productive than fighting against them."
pisces,2014-09-02,"You don't have the luxury of being able to daydream as much as you wish today. Unfortunately, you might not be able to find enough time to pursue your indulgent fantasies as circumstances require you to deal with an emotional issue that has been brewing for weeks. Take responsibility for your commitments before the situation becomes even more unmanageable. Maintaining a more thoughtful approach to life now helps to ensure more time later on to slip back into your colorful dreamworld."
aries,2014-09-03,"Although you wake up determined to do the right thing and finish your tasks at work today, your commitment grows stronger as the day continues to unfold. The pressure increases once you know what needs to be done, leaving you no option but to take care of business. However, it isn't wise to speed through your assignments or you could make a costly mistake. Establishing a sustainable pace right from the start is a healthier strategy than trying to be a superhero and doing too much too fast."
taurus,2014-09-03,"There's no reason to expend extra energy on an emotional outburst today when a low-key, rational discussion is more effective and creates less drama for everyone involved. Fortunately, relationship issues that might normally upset you are easy to take in stride because you believe that you can say whatever is on your mind. You may even feel so safe and insulated that you think no one is actually listening to your words. Nevertheless, others are more attentive than you realize, so consider your message carefully before you speak."
gemini,2014-09-03,"Your confidence is soaring today and you assume that your charisma enables you to get your ideas across to your audience. Even if you have enough charm and energy to swing into action without a plan, a cavalier attitude conflicts with a more contemplative side of your personality now. Although spontaneously expressing your creativity works in your favor, you don't need to ignore your previous research because it can help you hit your target with even more accuracy. The more tools in your toolkit, the better."
cancer,2014-09-03,"Your heart may win out over your head today in an internal battle between emotions and logic. Nevertheless, it's still smart to allow extra time to react to a situation before you do anything about it. Giving yourself sufficient space to process your feelings enables you to dig even deeper. Remember, it's fully acceptable to override a strong attraction now, but don't just shut down prematurely out of fear. Knowing what you truly want before you play your cards increases your odds of winning the hand."
leo,2014-09-03,"Your anticipation of the unknown heightens your sense of excitement today. However, it's crucial to decide what is worth pursuing because you might get more than you bargained for now if you start nosing around somewhere you don't belong. You're relentless once you put your mind toward untangling a puzzle or digging up a missing piece of information. If you choose your mystery wisely, sweet satisfaction can be yours."
virgo,2014-09-03,"You could find yourself in discussions that don't seem to go anywhere practical today, but the journey could be extremely rewarding, nonetheless. Your words might sound very emotional, even if that's not the message you're trying to communicate. Although you may attempt to keep your vulnerability hidden for now, the truth will probably leak out in the next few days, anyhow. Don't hold back; riding the tide of your feelings can deepen a close relationship even if you are slightly uncomfortable along the way."
libra,2014-09-03,"Although you would like to depend on others today, everyone seems to be on the edge of change and therefore somewhat unreliable. Meanwhile, you feel as if you can keep your own life in balance without anyone's help. Unfortunately, you may be operating under a false illusion based upon what you don't want to know. Keep in mind that it is less stressful in the long run to nip a problem in the bud than it is to wait and see what will happen next if you leave things to their own devices. An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
scorpio,2014-09-03,"Even if your work is piling up and you are feeling overwhelmed now, stopping midstream won't solve anything. The good news is you can finish your assignments if you just keep the faith and remain focused on what's most important. Although you might be tempted by a variety of distractions that lure you away from your mundane commitments, you need to ignore the interruptions for a while longer. Fortunately, the Sun's trine to your key planet Pluto gives you the unrelenting drive to maintain your concentration so you can reach your targeted destination on time."
sagittarius,2014-09-03,"Your over-the-top enthusiasm makes you eager to tackle your commitments today with an I-can-do-it attitude; however, your optimism alone doesn't guarantee success. You must demonstrate your professional competence before you ask others to accept you as their leader. Don't try to fake an authoritative air; stop talking and just put your heart into your work. Demonstrating your sincerity is the quickest route to gaining everyone's trust."
capricorn,2014-09-03,"You may be feeling a bit of anxiety today that's coming from all the uncontrollable energy floating through the cosmos. But this unstable atmosphere isn't necessarily bad; it's just that you're not comfortable when you sense that things are out of your control. You might be worried that there's just too much noise in your surroundings now for you to find lasting peace of mind. Instead of resisting the inevitable emotional turbulence, simply let go and enjoy the bumpy ride."
aquarius,2014-09-03,"It's in your best interest to immediately respond to any lingering questions from a close friend or partner because your window of opportunity is shutting quickly. Romantic Venus is ending her yearly visit to your 7th House of Others, so bring any relationship concerns you have now out into the open while you still can. Initiating honest dialogue is the first step to creating lasting resolution and deeper intimacy."
pisces,2014-09-03,"Express what's on your mind today while your emphatic words carry the conviction of your beliefs. The Sun in your 7th House of Partners is harmonizing with profound Pluto in your 11th House of Friends, empowering you to be more socially proactive. You're quite passionate about a relationship issue and, thankfully, you make a lot of sense now when you talk about your feelings. Aim your thoughts carefully and don't stray from speaking your truth no matter what anyone else thinks."
aries,2014-09-04,"Although you may like the idea of acting impulsively, you accomplish a lot more when you make a plan today and stick with it. It really doesn't matter if you feel constrained when you limit your options with exacting schedules and pressing commitments because it's easy to waste time and energy now when you lack accountability. Stop rebelling against the rules; use them as guidelines to increase your productivity, instead."
taurus,2014-09-04,"You have no choice but to figure things out on the fly today; fortunately, you will feel more confident once you know the whole story and have an action plan in place. Although the practical Capricorn Moon urges you to set realistic goals, it's still tempting to reach too far. It's not wise to take on any more projects until you have finished what's already on your plate because your current deadlines might not be as negotiable as you wish. Ironically, exercising self-discipline empowers you to complete your work with a creative flair."
gemini,2014-09-04,"You start out the day expecting everything to easily fall into place, but you might have to buckle down in order to take care of your obligations. It's a big mistake to think you can simply ignore the unspoken tension around you. Family dynamics and office politics are distractions from your work and you don't have the time to listen to everyone's story. Prioritize what's on your plate; just be sure to plot your course of action based upon the good of all involved."
cancer,2014-09-04,"Your x-ray vision can see right through someone's emotionally cool demeanor because you know what it's like to hide behind a wall of detachment to protect your feelings. However, the tables are turned today. You are comfortable with your own vulnerability, but might not have a confidant who is sensitive enough to hear what you have to say. Focus your communication on the most practical issues now and save a tender discussion for the right person, place and time, instead."
leo,2014-09-04,"What begins as a good time could morph into hard work now that the conscientious Capricorn Moon is visiting your 6th House of Service. The demands of your job are annoying today, especially if they get in the way of the mischief you wish you were making. You might even get sneaky and try to shuffle your schedule around so you can slip out of your obligations. Nevertheless, you must be rational and weigh the potential pleasure against your mundane responsibilities. Ultimately, adopting a practical approach may be your safest bet."
virgo,2014-09-04,"You are happy to be in your element today and pleased to have discovered a sensible solution to a lingering problem. Fortunately, you have realistic expectations now, so you should be fine even if your desires aren't fully satisfied. Accepting your current situation graciously could eventually lead to your success. Acting in a patient manner is a smart strategy as long as it's combined with the unrelenting pursuit of your dreams."
libra,2014-09-04,"There is a rich complexity in your life today; your colorful fantasy life contains more than meets the eye. But your dreams aren't just about finding true love and winning the lottery. Darker issues lure you into the shadows, even on a bright sunny day. Don't waste energy complaining about how much work there is to be done now; just thank your lucky stars for the potential rewards that will soon follow."
scorpio,2014-09-04,"Carefully consider every word you say before you open your mouth now that the emotionally reserved Capricorn Moon is creeping through your 3rd House of Communication. Although you want to make your point today, you're more likely to be successful if you're patient and wait for the right moment. Keep in mind that a loose tongue won't likely convert others to your point of view anyway. If you don't understand everything that's being said around you, ask questions first and speak your piece later."
sagittarius,2014-09-04,"A great opportunity for fun seems to slip through your fingers today. Furthermore, you might not want to be working at your desk when you could be out enjoying your next big adventure. Unfortunately, your immediate responsibilities may have you dreaming about a vacation getaway instead of actually packing your bags. Fulfilling your obligations isn't your idea of excitement, but you'll be more free to do what you want if you put work before play."
capricorn,2014-09-04,"You're typically not that comfortable revealing your vulnerability, but the emotional Moon's current visit to your sign softens you up. Although you might not show as much warmth as you feel today, you still want to connect with others without overstepping anyone's boundaries. Following simple rules of etiquette helps everyone involved feel more at ease. If you take it slowly and speak from your heart you'll reap positive results.."
aquarius,2014-09-04,"Your lack of privacy can become a serious issue today as the Moon journeys through your 12th House of Secrets. Unfortunately, obsessive behavior isn't useful, so it's a good idea to redirect your energy away from your desire for solitude. Keeping to yourself is one thing; but withdrawing from the world because you're hiding your truth is entirely something else. Ultimately, the choice is yours; finding the courage to talk with a trustworthy friend may be all that's needed now to lighten your load."
pisces,2014-09-04,"Don't be thrown off track by someone's dramatic display of emotions now, for this type of grand gesturing might be more of a sideshow than the main event. Trust your instincts; you know better than to judge anyone based on surface appearances. Fortunately, you have close friends you can rely on for a second opinion, and they might just come through for you in ways you can't imagine. Count your blessings; you have plenty of emotional support in your corner."
aries,2014-09-05,"Making up your plan as you go along isn't a smart idea today, even if this kind of improvisational approach usually works well for you. Listen to the message of the conservative Capricorn Moon and err on the side of being cautious rather than foolish. There isn't as much of an urgency as you might think; carefully contemplate your next move before taking decisive action that brings the results you want."
taurus,2014-09-05,"It's wonderful to be in the flow of things today, deftly balancing work with play. People admire how you can manage to have fun while still getting your chores done. Others randomly show up in your life now to offer enough of a diversion for you to find pleasure. Fortunately, the distractions are not great enough to hijack your day. Do not deviate very far from the rules, for an authority figure may react quickly if you fall victim to the temptations of irresponsibility. Keep it simple and stay on track to ensure the best possible outcome."
gemini,2014-09-05,"You have a keen sense of the difference between right and wrong today, making you an excellent arbitrator since you can easily understand both sides of an issue. However, your desire to see justice served doesn't necessarily give you the final word on a matter. Sharing your opinions in a non-judgmental manner is a wiser course of action, rather than simply declaring your pronouncements. Once you state your impressions, give others the time and space to form conclusions on their own."
cancer,2014-09-05,"Although you are fortunate enough to receive unsolicited offers of help, you still might hesitate to take initiative. Your friends or coworkers may encourage you to think big and keep pushing ahead with your latest idea or project. Nevertheless, it's more effective to proceed at your own pace. There's no reason to rush anything just because someone else thinks you should. The fact is you will instinctively know when to make your move; trust your inner voice above all else."
leo,2014-09-05,"Domestic obligations are calling you and they can become more trouble than you want if you don't  handle them now. Nevertheless, there's no sense in wasting your energy feeling guilty about what you can't do. It's more satisfying to achieve a small success than worrying about everything you did wrong. Taking a block of time to relax enables you to shift your perspective and see things in a new light before returning your attention to an unresolved problem at home. A simple change in attitude can make all the difference in the world."
virgo,2014-09-05,"You may roll out of bed this morning already feeling better from the Moon's current visit to your 5th House of Fun and Games. But you don't hit the jackpot until midday when sweet Venus takes up residence in your sign for a three-week visit. A smile on your face seems to appear for no reason at all, but you can tell that circumstances are definitely improving. Happily, your positive energy casts you in the spotlight where others are inspired by your optimistic outlook on life."
libra,2014-09-05,"Your willingness to stop and reflect on a personal matter can clear a path to a magical and memorable experience today. Unfortunately, your resistance to change intensifies if you singularly focus on your goals, instead of on the amazing journey that leads to your destination. Your current lesson is all about giving up control; ironically, loosening your grip on the reins of external events now also frees you from your own restraints. Let go to grow."
scorpio,2014-09-05,"Pleasurable feelings flow back and forth between you and your friends, especially if you are collaborating on a project of mutual interest. In fact the positive vibes feel so good there's no reason to force any issues now or push for resolution on open-ended conversations. Just do your best to turn each interaction into a learning opportunity while still remembering to be methodical in your work. It might seem strange but your motto today is ""All for one and one for all."""
sagittarius,2014-09-05,"You're probably feeling more enthusiastic about your prospects at work now. This new wave of optimism might be fed, in part, by something as simple as getting sufficient sleep. You could even have a feeling that a memorable event is going to occur today. But don't leave everything up to chance; the longer you believe in a fantasy, the more likely you can actually make it real. Let your star shine brightly for the world to see."
capricorn,2014-09-05,"Your hard work could be for naught today if you let a bad attitude get in your way of success. Changing your perspective is extremely helpful because you still might be clinging to a negative experience from the past. But slipping into denial to avoid your feelings isn't as useful as it sounds. It's much healthier to embrace old hurts so you can process them and move on. Thankfully, your current emotional state should settle down when the moody Moon leaves your sign later in the day. In the meantime, be gentle with everyone, especially yourself."
aquarius,2014-09-05,"You might resist accepting compliments today because you aren't convinced that you truly deserve them. Unfortunately, you may be stuck in memories that feed your low self-esteem now, even if sincere appreciation comes your way. Stop fighting the inevitable; open your heart and allow the love to touch you without hiding behind walls of self-doubt. Learning to receive graciously is a gift in itself."
pisces,2014-09-05,"Handling criticism is easy today because it's probably being offered in a supportive manner. Of course, you would prefer approval, but you're truly interested in improving your game more than anything else. When others give you feedback now, they're not telling you what you did wrong; instead, they're sharing valid information that can help you succeed. If you listen carefully you might just hear a truth that could transform your life."
aries,2014-09-06,"You might not be too worried about your responsibilities today as your thoughts drift toward the big picture. You are usually content focusing on the present moment. However, you may be looking further ahead now, wondering what could be lurking around the next bend in the road. It's wise to avoid making any major decisions about your future just yet. Keeping your options open for a few more days gives you a chance to explore your dreams for a while longer."
taurus,2014-09-06,"Reassessing your life path makes perfect sense when the Moon takes up residence in your 10th House of Public Life, but it may feel like you are traveling a circuitous route to success. You could even work yourself into a state of anxiety today as you try to make a straightforward plan to reach your goals. Ironically, it's healthier now to let go of your concerns; further analysis won't help you find a solution. Instead, pursue activities that relax your body and soothe your nerves. The best answers will come to you when you are in a calmer state of mind."
gemini,2014-09-06,"Your life seems to be flowing along a bit smoother now, even if the very same issues are still begging for resolution. Fortunately, you don't have to worry about fixing everything today which eases the tension sufficiently enough for you to enjoy the blessings in your life. Just remember that your overactive imagination could carry you far away, distracting you from the happiness that is right under your nose. Open your eyes and be grateful for what you have."
cancer,2014-09-06,"You may be feeling somewhat alienated today, even if your family and friends are within reach. You cherish your privacy and might keep your thoughts to yourself, but this secrecy only increases the emotional gulf between you and others. However, this self-imposed isolation also reminds you of your inner strength. Don't let lingering fears sidetrack your dreams; use your current time alone to visualize the path to your future success before reconnecting with those you love."
leo,2014-09-06,You might feel as if others are withholding their true emotions and pulling away from you now. The Moon's presence in your 7th House of Relationships shifts the focus from your own little world to observing the reactions of everyone else. Don't rely on your perceptions alone to give you objective data as you could get carried away with your false assumptions and not even know it. Stop spinning stories and just listen to your heart.
virgo,2014-09-06,"It's your usual no-nonsense style to roll up your sleeves and get the job done, but reaching closure on any project doesn't come so easily now. It might even feel as if your final destination is slipping away the closer you get to it. Obviously, giving up is not the preferred solution; it's smarter to accept the timing that reality imposes on you now. Keep moving forward without worrying how far there is yet to go; not all progress can be measured."
libra,2014-09-06,"Ingenious thoughts are running rampant through your mind now as the Moon activates your 5th House of Self-Expression. But it's up to you to decide how to present your most creative visions for maximum impact. Unfortunately, a brilliant idea might have little to do with fulfilling your present obligations. Don't become discouraged before you even start; instead, work extra hard to be responsible in all that you do. Thankfully, letting your inner child out to play doesn't have to stop you from honoring your commitments."
scorpio,2014-09-06,"Don't let the memories of your past come between the present moment and your future just because the Moon's visit to your 4th House of Foundations brings you back to your childhood. Naturally, you have big ideas about what your success looks like. You may even have your bucket list all sorted out and ready to go, but these dreams seem very far away right now. Although you have some serious issues to contemplate today, making minor adjustments can have an immediate impact on your life."
sagittarius,2014-09-06,"There are so many things on your to-do list today, that it really doesn't even matter where you jump in. One thing is for sure: procrastination isn't your friend. You may find yourself in trouble by the end of the day unless you hit the ground running as soon as you wake up. Remember, creating a sensible plan is a great first step, but you still must work diligently to follow through on anything that you start. The sooner you get going, the sooner you're done."
capricorn,2014-09-06,"You don't want to be caught up in an intense whirlwind of activity today since you know that it's better to finish one project well than do many things carelessly. However, focusing on your work is an exercise in futility now, especially if your heart isn't in it. You will be fine if you just remember to employ common sense throughout the day. Others will be suitably impressed if you keep things genuine, no matter what curve balls are thrown your way."
aquarius,2014-09-06,"It's tempting to suppress your emotions in favor of a more rational approach today. However, the Moon's monthly visit to your sign reminds you once again that you're happier when you honor your feelings -- even if they temporarily make you uncomfortable. Your evasive strategy might enable you to move more quickly through a situation, but you could miss an important lesson in the process. Slow down and allow your heart, instead of your head, to tell you what you need to hear."
pisces,2014-09-06,"Recent emotional confusion might have sapped your energy, leaving you too exhausted to talk about your feelings today. You may even want to take a temporary break from a romantic attachment now just to spare yourself the drama. Thankfully, the Moon's emphasis on your 12th House of Privacy encourages you to be alone for a little while. Don't worry about how others react to your current desire for solitude. Engaging in a spiritual practice is the best medicine for your soul."
aries,2014-09-07,"Although nearly everything about your life may seem complicated today, it's not necessarily unpleasant. In fact, you're able to see subtleties that were previously imperceptible and you can seamlessly integrate them into your current perspective. But be careful; your impulsive style tempts you to jump to conclusions even if your assumptions are faulty. Adding a dash of common sense to the mix when you're making decisions now goes a long way to prevent problems later on."
taurus,2014-09-07,"Your vision of the future is based on a perfect combination of your pragmatic perspective and your legendary determination. Your dreams can be rejuvenating to your creativity, but it's nearly impossible to make plans now if you set your goals too high. It's not that you're greedy; it's just that everything good appears to be within easy reach. Let your imagination run wild, but reconsider your options next week when your clarity returns."
gemini,2014-09-07,"Your scattered energy stirs up plenty of trouble today, leading you to forget your previous plans and spontaneously make new ones. But you cannot just assume that your daydreams will turn into reality, for a sudden twist of events could jolt you awake and make you deal with the truth. Although it might seem like you're being inundated with a hodge-podge of information at first, you may be pleasantly surprised with the results."
cancer,2014-09-07,"Although you won't be able to shut off your overactive imagination, you cannot drift far from reality now without getting pulled back into the rat race. A friend or partner might remind you of your previous obligations, leaving very little room for flights of fancy. Nevertheless, you are inclined to listen to your gut instincts today, rather than your logic. A little daydreaming is okay as long as you don't let your fantasies distract you from the work at hand."
leo,2014-09-07,"You are very passionate about someone or something today, and your intensity can be overwhelming to those who don't understand your intentions. However, your sense of purpose is strong and you want interruption-free time to focus on your work. Nevertheless, your desires are pulled in a direction which tests your resolve and self-discipline. Hiding your emotions only intensifies them now, potentially provoking a dramatic eruption later. Instead, express your feelings calmly while you have the chance to create a positive impact."
virgo,2014-09-07,"You're receiving mixed cosmic signals today, telling you to stick to the facts while simultaneously turning up the volume on your fantasies. You might try to ignore your daydreams, but they keep popping up whether they're invited or not. Stop thinking that you have to pick mundane reality over your creative vision. Instead, enjoy the dialogue between these two realms as long as possible. Oddly enough, cultivating your imagination is a wonderful way to enhance your productivity."
libra,2014-09-07,"It's tricky to focus on practical matters today, even if you think you already have a viable plan in place. It doesn't really matter that you have made previous commitments; you want to do something more interesting than just fulfilling your obligations. Thankfully, making time for a quick escape or a creative diversion can be revitalizing to your spirit. Giving yourself permission to have fun now will enable you to return to your unfinished chores with renewed enthusiasm."
scorpio,2014-09-07,"You could get so caught up in your desires today that you can rationalize nearly anything. Happily, love floats through the atmosphere this evening with the Moon hanging out in your 5th House of Play and Venus flirting in your 11th House of Social Networking. However, your heightened passion and faulty logic might lead you astray. Unfortunately, once your analysis is complete, you still must face the issues that you tried to avoid in the first place. Remember, you don't need to take everything so seriously; give yourself permission to bask in the good feelings while they last."
sagittarius,2014-09-07,"This could be such a busy weekend socially that you don't have enough time to hear your own thoughts. Fortunately, you may enjoy the wide variety of activities, but sometimes your friends and family might be too much energy to manage. Don't be afraid to establish healthy boundaries even if it means leaving the party a little early. You're not responsible for everyone's happiness today; make sure to take care of your own needs, too."
capricorn,2014-09-07,"You may be disappointed with yourself if you don't meet all your responsibilities today. But your mind can wander far and wide now, making it difficult to live up to your commitments. You might attempt to curtail your daydreaming because you believe that it reduces your productivity. Ironically, the opposite is true; your active imagination feeds your creativity, enabling you to accomplish more than you expect."
aquarius,2014-09-07,"Your innovative thinking brings unexpected answers to long-standing questions today. However, being too clever for your own good could prompt you to act on a false assumption or jump to an incorrect conclusion. Even if you want to uncover the truth, it may be better to trust your intuition now instead of only relying on the facts. A cautious approach is more productive than a spontaneous one, so take time to develop your idea before you put it into action."
pisces,2014-09-07,"Set aside your regular routine long enough to make time to get in touch with your soul today. Rather than running errands and doing chores, turn your day into a magical one by reveling in your creative imagination. Make use of the Moon's return to your dreamy sign by escaping from the everyday world and indulging in your fantasies or spiritual pursuits. You can always take care of unfinished business later in the week when you're in a more practical frame of mind."
aries,2014-09-08,"You may convince a coworker that you respect confidentiality, but your intentions are better than your follow-through as erratic Uranus in your impulsive sign forms an anxious alignment with the willful Sun. Today's Pisces Full Moon brightens your 12th House of Privacy, sending mixed messages and bringing your secrets out into the light. Although explaining your truth might make you feel uncomfortable at first, being honest is a necessary first step toward creating harmony in your relationships."
taurus,2014-09-08,"Although you are normally content to remain in your comfort zone, you're eagerly anticipating embarking on a wonderful new adventure now. The Pisces Full Moon floods your 11th House of Social Networking, luring you away from your tunnel vision so you can catch a glimpse of the big world outside. Take a chance and reach farther than you have in the past. There's no room for complacency; the future is waiting for you if you are willing to step into it."
gemini,2014-09-08,"Business opportunities pop up everywhere you turn as today's intuitive Pisces Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Professional Goals. Luckily, you see chances to show off your skills in nearly every interaction. However, your struggle now is to narrow the field of possibilities rather than wasting time running in circles of illusion. Several alternatives look so good that you can instantaneously imagine positive results. Nevertheless, you still have plenty of hard work ahead of you, so don't count your chickens before they hatch."
cancer,2014-09-08,"All the flowery language in the world won't pull you off your chosen path today if the intention behind a presentation doesn't make practical sense, too. The spiritual Pisces Moon shining in your 9th House of Philosophy reflects your need to justify your position by talking about your lofty ideals. Make a list of the things you can do now that will get you closer to your goals. Keep bringing your conceptual ideas back down to earth if you want to manifest your dreams."
leo,2014-09-08,"There are fundamental differences between your needs and those of a close friend or partner today. Working with other people can complicate your life, but cooperation is now necessary since the Pisces Full Moon rocks your 8th House of Shared Resources. You might even try to avoid an emotionally tense discussion that rattles your core beliefs. Nevertheless, evasive action alone won't sustain your relationships for very long. Instead of running away from the truth, stop for a moment and embrace it."
virgo,2014-09-08,"You know better than to immediately choose one side in an argument just because you have some of the facts in front of you. Today's soulful Pisces Full Moon reflects the no-nonsense Virgo Sun from your 7th House of Relationships, requiring you to have compassion for your opponent. There's more to the current issue than simply playing by the rules; you may need to make a few allowances for those who aren't as logical as you. A little forgiveness goes a long way toward bridging the gulf between you and others."
libra,2014-09-08,"Maintaining your objectivity may not be as useful as you think today. The dreamy Pisces Full Moon lights up your 6th House of Details, reminding you that following your imagination can take you farther now than simply executing your plan according to the book. Treating rules as helpful guidelines rather than bothersome restrictions enables you to listen more closely to your intuition. If you get a strong hunch about what to do next, stop asking questions and just do it."
scorpio,2014-09-08,"If you can't justify taking a substantial amount of time off from work now, then at least try expressing yourself more creatively within the demands of your job. It's pointless to follow a previously created recipe for success or navigate your life by using someone else's map. Instead, take advantage of the Pisces Full Moon's energy in your 5th House of Play to add a bit of spontaneity back into your daily routine. Follow your bliss and let your inner child out to play."
sagittarius,2014-09-08,"You might not know as much as you think you do about the emotional storms brewing on the home front. Today's Pisces Full Moon enlightens your 4th House of Domestic Conditions, suggesting that you could be fooling yourself by believing that everyone is happy. To the contrary, someone close to you may be working hard to cover up his or her insecurities. Instead of accepting the truth as you see it, take time to explore the subtle messages behind the smiles. Opening your heart leads the way to deeper connections with those you love."
capricorn,2014-09-08,"You may feel unsettled by the cosmic cross-currents today because you prefer to have your feet firmly planted on the ground. You need to know your current position and have a good map in your possession. But the Pisces Full Moon throws confusing light on your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, making it nearly impossible to discern navigational markers in the landscape. Nevertheless, there's no need to struggle so much; trusting the forces of the universe enables you to reach your destination on time."
aquarius,2014-09-08,"Managing your cash flow today could be challenging as the fuzzy Pisces Full Moon fogs out your 2nd House of Finances. However, you can still get ahead of the curve, even if you are lacking the right answers. Luckily, you have a brilliant ally who magically appears at exactly the right moment. If you don't have a viable solution now, don't be afraid to lean on a trustworthy friend or find a professional adviser to set you straight. There's no reason to let pride stand in the way of your success."
pisces,2014-09-08,"Your fantasies seem to be blown out of proportion now that the emotional Full Moon spotlights your wildly imaginative sign. The Sun's aspect to unpredictable Uranus makes it even trickier to handle the erratic relationship dynamics that could catch you off guard. Nevertheless, you must maintain a healthy perspective on your dreams by behaving rationally in spite of your strong feelings. Instead of stressing about making any long-lasting decisions now, put them off for a day or two until you have regained clarity. In the meantime, throw your worries out the window and enjoy the spiritual ride."
aries,2014-09-09,"It's not that you are digging up hidden information because you want to create any problems today; you may feel as if you don't really have a choice. Something isn't sitting  quite right and you won't be comfortable until you get to the bottom of it. Although you might worry that you won't like what you discover, your fear is likely blown out of proportion. Dealing with the facts is easier than stressing about the unknown. Fortunately, your current persistence works in your favor, so don't give up until you have uncovered the entire truth."
taurus,2014-09-09,"You're not in a negotiating mood today and could remain unmoved by everyone's attempts to change your mind. You are tired of hiding your motives but you still don't want others to know your true feelings just yet. If you are reluctant to engage in emotional interactions, you are not obliged to tell anyone why. Do whatever you can to avoid an outright argument now but don't compromise your integrity in the process."
gemini,2014-09-09,"You won't be coerced into doing anything that is outside of your comfort zone today. You are quite capable of holding your ground now, even if pressure is applied by a powerful adversary. Making your position clear is a good start, but don't waste words in endless explanations. You can always share more details later on after the intensity settles down. You won't offend anyone with your silence; in fact, others can't help but admire your fierce determination."
cancer,2014-09-09,Your reaction to a loved one's behavior may be quick and intense now as quicksilver Mercury squares passionate Pluto in your 7th House of Partners. Even the most casual conversation could agitate your feelings and bring a dormant resentment back into awareness. Be extra careful today or you might inadvertently hurt someone if you express your heartfelt anger at the wrong target. A sensible dose of self-restraint goes a long way to keep the peace.
leo,2014-09-09,"You may attack like a lion if you feel that someone is threatening your financial stability today. Although you could be driven to confront a powerful person, make certain it's necessary before you start something that could grow into an intense encounter. Take a few deep breaths and consider your alternatives first. If you really want to take care of business now, winning an argument isn't as important as getting your point across. Waiting a day or two to put all the facts in order might just work to your advantage."
virgo,2014-09-09,"Your words might be sharper than you realize today and could cut like a razor, even if that's not your intention. You can be very sarcastic as witty Mercury intensifies its intellectual edge in the fires of Pluto's passions. Unfortunately, your heightened emotional state diminishes your innate objectivity, so it's important to be as clear as possible in all that you say. However, balancing your message with a bit of compassion is helpful if you want others to respond in a positive manner."
libra,2014-09-09,"You believe that you are being very rational now that logical Mercury is in your fair-minded sign. However, someone else's extreme reactions might be spilling over into your life. An emotional outbreak won't solve anything, and it could leave you feeling unsatisfied and depleted. Fortunately, you can soften the hard energy of the day by making a conscious effort to practice kindness wherever you go. Hopefully, your positive attitude will rub off on everyone around you."
scorpio,2014-09-09,"You want to express your point of view in no uncertain terms today as communicator Mercury squares your key planet Pluto. But Mercury has taken up residence in your 12th House of Secrets, raising your anxiety about how much to say and what to keep to yourself. You could become obsessive as you sort out what makes the most sense to reveal. However, there are many ways to draw your boundaries, so it is up to you to decide what you want to handle. Err on the side of saying less now, since you can always choose to go deeper later on once you've established a certain level of trust."
sagittarius,2014-09-09,"You may be quite certain about your decisions today, yet your confidence could turn into rigid self-righteousness if you don't honor the feelings of others. Unfortunately, you could run into a problem professionally if you provoke a conflict with your boss. It's a waste of time and energy to think you can change the dynamics of the situation by rationalizing your actions. Go ahead and build your case, but don't stir up any unnecessary trouble until the emotional uncertainty passes."
capricorn,2014-09-09,"Locating the source of your uneasiness is complicated today, but an unspoken truth could resurface again and again in a series of disagreements. However, you might be arguing about something that's completely irrelevant while the real issue remains just outside of your awareness. Be smart and save your criticism for another day after you've had time to calm down and put things into a healthy perspective. Take a much-needed break and do something special to soothe your nerves and lift your spirits."
aquarius,2014-09-09,"Something has been bothering you and it won't go away until you tackle the problem directly. Unfortunately, you may not realize the source of your emotional discomfort now, making it difficult to resolve the situation. Don't blame anyone else for your extreme reactions. Instead, take full responsibility for your feelings and communicate with as much compassion as possible. Not only will you feel better after you share your heart, but others might also follow your lead."
pisces,2014-09-09,"Your friends may not be very supportive today as they take you to task on an issue that you thought was fairly straightforward. This unexpected disagreement creates additional anxiety because you aren't sure that you can trust your logical analysis, even if others are demanding that you do what makes the most sense. If your heart continues to tell you something different, follow its message now instead of all the words swirling around in your head."
aries,2014-09-10,"Although you often know exactly what you want in love, your romantic goals aren't very clear now. You could idealize your desires today, which is a lot of fun as long as you don't assume they must be fulfilled. Too many concrete expectations hinder your current metaphysical journey. However, going with the flow may reward you with a very beautiful experience that can resonate in your heart for a long time to come."
taurus,2014-09-10,"You may misread an emotional interaction today unless you're paying careful attention to the subtle cues in every conversation. You might be feeling some ambiguity with respect to a developing relationship. Allowing your thoughts to wander around in the realms of possibility, although an enjoyable distraction, won't necessarily lead to personal satisfaction. Instead, focus on the most immediate issues at hand in order to set your train back on the well-traveled tracks of reality."
gemini,2014-09-10,"Although you plan to discuss practical issues at work today, your colorful fantasies are so enticing that you have trouble staying on topic. You may assume your position is clear but your coworkers might misunderstand your message. Unfortunately, you could convince yourself that further explanation isn't necessary. However, it's easy to avoid problems by unfolding your ideas one at a time and asking for feedback as you go along. There's no reason to bury your dreams as long as you keep them in check while discussing more mundane matters."
cancer,2014-09-10,"Your schedule could fall apart at the seams today if you don't allow time for everything that needs to be accomplished. You might not be as prepared as you prefer as people aren't sharing their expectations with you. Instead of floundering your way through the day in uncertainty, ask concrete questions to receive specific answers. Your friends and associates may surprise you with their down-to-earth responses that can save the day."
leo,2014-09-10,"You could be living in a bubble of fantasy, even if you believe your self-assessment is grounded in reality. It may even be challenging to get a clear handle on what you can bring to the table. Unfortunately, facts are colored by your feelings now, and it's nearly impossible to separate your objective perceptions from subjective opinions unless you make a conscious decision to do so. Thankfully, the potential for creating meaning in your life grows stronger when your intuitive visions are fully integrated."
virgo,2014-09-10,"Normally, you can deftly manage the details of a complex project and keep all the separate tasks in order. However, it may be more effective now to save your critical analysis for another time. Instead of trying to limit your thoughts, give yourself permission to space out and explore unknown territory. Your imagination is your greatest asset today, so don't be afraid to put it to work. The most creative solutions to your current dilemmas will be the ones that arise out of unstructured thinking. Listening to your intuition allows you to tap into your unexpressed ingenuity."
libra,2014-09-10,"You are quite introspective today as your key planet Venus takes center stage in your 12th House of Privacy. If you must spend the day with others, you can still withdraw into your dream world while appearing as socially astute as ever.  However, balancing your work obligations with your current desire to be alone might be a challenge. It's not an either / or proposition; you can collaborate with your peers and still retreat into your imagination for inspiration whenever you wish."
scorpio,2014-09-10,"You may have a very specific idea about which activities you want to share with your friends now, but your job might not give you the freedom you desire. You're not one to run out on your responsibilities once you have made a heartfelt commitment. However, you can rearrange your schedule to finish up your work early without negatively impacting your productivity. Following through on your word is vital to your integrity, but so is pursuing your dreams."
sagittarius,2014-09-10,"Conditions on the home front can be all too confusing, but they aren't your biggest problem today. Things are not as they appear now and it's tricky to gauge the relative importance of a particular thought. Taking a clever idea and turning it into an overly complicated strategy won't make it any more successful. Keep your message simple and succinct. Misunderstandings that come to light in the next few days will make you glad that you strive for simplicity today."
capricorn,2014-09-10,"Other people attempt to use ambitious schemes to lure you away from your previous commitments today. Unfortunately, you could grow overwhelmed if you can't control your personal desires. There are days when you can build the road as well as travel along it. However, today's planetary patterns are meant for exploring territories that are off the beaten track. Spend a bit of time wandering around, knowing that you'll be back on the highway and heading toward your destination again in just a few days."
aquarius,2014-09-10,"Although you have specific goals and a concrete plan in place, you can't seem to find the inner resolve to achieve your goals today. People can see a gentler side of you as your hidden emotional tenderness slips through the cracks in your defenses. Instead of fighting it, consciously let others inside your otherwise impenetrable walls. Vulnerability is your strength now, not your weakness."
pisces,2014-09-10,"Today you might fall in love with a beautiful person, a spiritual practice or a fleeting vision. Unfortunately, it's unlikely that you can tell the difference between reality and fantasy now. Nevertheless, fact and fiction might just morph into a magical moment that opens your heart. Don't try to figure out what's happening; just relax and enjoy the experience. Untangle the threads in the tapestry of life on another day after the clouds of illusion drift away."
aries,2014-09-11,"Complex issues continue to weigh on your psyche today, even as real world pressures appear to ease. Although you're trying to reestablish balance between your needs and the demands of working with others, you might overstate the importance of a personal preference. Consider backing down from your supposedly non-negotiable position since your strong opinions could instigate an unnecessary meltdown. Compromise is more constructive than conflict."
taurus,2014-09-11,"Although your intent is to come clean today, it may be impossible to put your feelings out in the open with the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Secrets. It's best to avoid being drawn into an intense disagreement that's fueled by fear of the unknown. Shining your light of awareness into the shadows of consciousness is complicated at first, but grows easier when the Moon enters your dependable sign later this evening. Demonstrate your commitment to the process by clearing the air as soon as possible."
gemini,2014-09-11,"You might experience a wide range of feelings that don't seem to have an acceptable outlet in your current social setting today. However, these unexpressed emotions still have a strong influence on what's occurring in your outer world. It may be tough at first to overcome the resistance, but the blockages are easier to handle once you realize that you are the real obstacle to open communication and not anyone else. Fortunately, your fears will subside in the face of your clear intentions and unrelenting persistence. Hang on until your logic returns."
cancer,2014-09-11,You aren't hesitant about expressing your private feelings today so you might have no trouble at all saying exactly what's on your mind. This isn't about suddenly making outrageous demands; it's about honoring your inner voice. Don't keep your thoughts locked up now even if you're not sure about the consequences of your disclosure. Say what you must; just remember to be kind and gentle in your approach so others will be more receptive to your message.
leo,2014-09-11,"Try not to overcompensate for any lingering emotional insecurity by acting more dramatically than you actually feel today. Disguising your vulnerability with an inflated demonstration of passion can trick others into believing that you have more self-confidence than you really do now. Find someone you trust and openly discuss your dilemma, hoping the ensuing conversation could help you sort out your fears and doubts. Oddly enough, just opening up helps you regain your self-esteem."
virgo,2014-09-11,"Hiding your feelings isn't a viable option now since everyone seems to know what you're thinking before you even say a word. Ironically, when you take the time to explain yourself in great detail, you still aren't sure that anyone else really understands what you need. Carefully examine your motives so you don't mislead someone in a way that could be problematic down the road. Once you are clear about your intentions, it will be easier to communicate them to others. Transparency is your friend."
libra,2014-09-11,"You don't need to let anyone push you around, since you have more power than you realize today. Although it may be challenging to manage the uncharacteristic intensity of your immediate reactions, nothing is gained by obsessing about something that you cannot change now. Continue to practice moderating your extreme emotions and seek middle ground wherever possible. Thankfully, you can take a common sense approach without compromising your integrity."
scorpio,2014-09-11,"Sexy Venus flirts with the fine line between fact and fancy today. You aren't in the mood to play games now, unless you believe they will lead somewhere pleasurable. Nevertheless, you still strive to do what's right, even if you already know what you want. Watch your step; make sure that everyone is on the same page before reaching a point of no return."
sagittarius,2014-09-11,"Logic isn't necessarily a part of your equation today as you attempt to satisfy your desires. You may be openly communicating with a romantic partner, yet your words can also act as a smokescreen that hides feelings you don't want to discuss. Avoid coercive tactics since they add power to what's not being said. Shedding light on your emotions minimizes unnecessary confusion later on. Engaging in an honest dialogue is the first step to being your authentic self."
capricorn,2014-09-11,"Even your closest friends might have a hard time understanding how deeply your passions run today. Although you don't often use evocative language to express your needs, your heart can be just as vulnerable as anyone else's. Something special may be stewing in the emotional slow cooker, but it's too soon to declare it done. Don't hurry the process; good things come to those who wait."
aquarius,2014-09-11,"Your desires could be overridden by everyone else's demands today. Ultimately, you might decide that it's better to conform instead of rigidly sticking to your own plans. It may be inconvenient to stand up to others right now even if you know what you want; the time and effort required isn't worth it. But your needs grow in strength if you simply try to ignore them. Avoid the possibility of losing your temper by letting others know your preferences without being attached to the outcome."
pisces,2014-09-11,"Simultaneously dancing in multiple realities can be exciting today, but it also produces additional stress. You are tempted to choose one set of emotions to live by, while burying another. However, you're being called to do powerful inner work while still maintaining external appearances. Keeping one foot in each realm helps you face your feelings now, even if you cannot fully integrate them into your current life yet."
aries,2014-09-12,"You can barely contain your enthusiasm today as you visualize new money-making ventures or discover more efficient ways to do your job. Although you may resist settling down at first, it grows easier to find your rhythm as the day wears on. Fortunately, you can effectively filter out the impractical ideas now so you don't waste precious time scattering your energy. Instead of getting lost in unrealistic visions of the future, keep bringing your focus back to the present moment without being overly concerned about what happens next."
taurus,2014-09-12,"You may grow so complacent now that boredom sneaks back into your life. The Moon's monthly visit to your bucolic sign normally helps you find the solace you seek. However, you could begin thinking about different ways to stir up some excitement today. But tread carefully; once you open the floodgates, you might wish for the calmer times you left behind. Instead of destabilizing your life, just change your attitude. You don't have to turn everything upside down to make your day a success."
gemini,2014-09-12,"You're craving action today and plan to sneak away to play even before you complete your work. However, you can't just run off without suffering some sort of consequences. Unfortunately, your annoyance with the current constraints might grow into resentment and make it impossible to have any fun later on. Stop wasting your energy; meet your obligations expediently, so you have the time for a rejuvenating escape after you fulfill your promises and your conscience is clear."
cancer,2014-09-12,"You realize how amazing your friends are now, especially those who stand up to defend you or rush to your side when you need help. Although your allies may not think that their behavior is out of the ordinary, their humility is what makes their acts of kindness so special. There's no reason to turn your appreciation into too much of a fuss today as long as you make certain that those you cherish know how much you value their presence in your life."
leo,2014-09-12,"Although you know that you should just follow instructions and do what you're told today, your heart might not be into it. You are not happy deferring to someone else's agenda and don't want to chase a pot of gold that isn't at the end of your own rainbow. It may be healthier to focus on your personal goals now rather than anyone else's. Just be sure that your new-found heightened practicality doesn't stand between you and an otherwise delightful time. You can have your cake and eat it too if you budget your resources wisely."
virgo,2014-09-12,"You could have an exciting vision about your future today, without necessarily becoming too attached to it. Although you can dream of an extraordinary outcome to your current situation, it's not likely to happen without your full participation. But be careful about stepping over the fine line between possibilities and fantasies. Believing in the impossible inspires you to stretch beyond your normal limits, but actually reaching your destination still requires advanced planning and hard work."
libra,2014-09-12,"You're tired of being patient because you have a specific goal in mind and you see no logical reason to wait any further before executing your plan. Your sense of urgency may be fueled by someone who seems to be even more impulsive than you are today. Nevertheless, your current comfort level could be a deterrent to change. Don't over-analyze your feelings. Just listen to your intuition; if you think that postponing your move makes sense now, then that is exactly what you should do."
scorpio,2014-09-12,"Someone might encourage you to take an unnecessary risk today, but your intuition might hold you back from leaping into the abyss. Although you may be tempted to reveal your current negativity, doing so could jeopardize your recent progress. Nevertheless, the unexpected support feels good and it makes you consider extending your reach to the stars. Naturally, you're free to respond in any manner you see fit, but minimizing your concerns helps calm your fears."
sagittarius,2014-09-12,"You could be tempted to lower your expectations today so your coworkers don't disappoint you with their lack of reliability. However, adopting a nonchalant approach isn't a smart tactic for long. Teamwork may be required to reach your goals, so don't let anyone off the hook too easily. Aim high and remind others of their commitments so you don't fall short of your target. Ironically, your colleagues might be counting on you to set an example for them to follow."
capricorn,2014-09-12,"You may feel scattered and have trouble concentrating on your chores today because your mind keeps drifting to everything else you want to do. However, if your extracurricular activities aren't bringing you enough pleasure, your thoughts might be harder to control as you attempt to find your groove. Instead of trying to make progress on every front, just pick one and chip away at it. Limit your options now in order to expand your future possibilities later."
aquarius,2014-09-12,You wish you could get away with being irresponsible today and skip out on your previous promises. You might make a judgment error which leads you to think that you're more effective spending time motivating others now rather than just buckling down and meeting your obligations. But the truth is there's no substitute for leading by example. Don't dilute your power by talking about what needs to happen; just do it.
pisces,2014-09-12,"You might be reluctant to admit you're feeling so optimistic today because you're afraid it reveals too much vulnerability on your part. However, you probably do believe that better times are just around the next corner. Meanwhile, your personal life may suffer because you are focusing on the future instead of dealing with a relationship issue in the present. Bringing your attention back to the here and now is challenging at first, but opening your heart is the key to happiness in the long run."
aries,2014-09-13,"Just when you thought you had everything under control, you suddenly realize that you must be dreaming. The electrical circuits are all switched on high, sparks are flying everywhere and mental fuses are blowing left and right. It's like a laser light show playing in your mind. But if you try to stop the performance, you might only make matters worse. As long as you respect the boundaries of others, this cosmic shock can be an amazingly creative experience."
taurus,2014-09-13,"Perhaps your mother once warned you about crazy days like this. You planned on enjoying your favorite Saturday routine, but the cosmos apparently have a wildly different idea. You might as well set your schedule aside, for it's not going to unfold as you imagined. At first, you could feel irritated that you're not getting your way but if you can relax into the flow, you may be thrilled with the unexpected twists and turns you encounter."
gemini,2014-09-13,"If you're a performer in a circus, it's wise to let someone else handle your high-wire acts today since the universe has a few surprises in store for you. However, if you are a juggler, you might be able to keep more balls in the air and more plates spinning on sticks than ever before. Just remember that when you are on a roll with events happening faster than normal, you can't rely on your brakes to stop in time. Planning ahead is still a smart move even if you need to make adjustments on the fly."
cancer,2014-09-13,"Your nerves could get rattled today by someone who appears to take delight in pushing your buttons. Although you might feel as if you are being attacked, most likely this isn't the case. People can unintentionally say hurtful things that don't carry an emotional charge for them, yet your acute sensitivity reads it as a personal affront. Step back, take a few deep breaths and shake it off. You can't control the actions of others but you can control how you respond."
leo,2014-09-13,"Today can be packed with fun and frivolity as long as you're not planning on getting any rest and relaxation. There could be some unfamiliar emotional intensity in the air, prompting you to spread your wings and fly far away from the drama. Your intentions may be challenged by others but if you mean well, they will eventually forget their doubts and join in your pursuit of pleasure. Your passionate nature is hard to resist."
virgo,2014-09-13,"Don't bother trying to accomplish too many mundane mental tasks today. Brilliant Uranus electrifies your ruling planet Mercury, creating sudden epiphanies and taking every ounce of willpower you can muster just to keep up with your own thoughts. Try to keep the best ones in your net of consciousness. Give your mind a chance to explore uncharted space since you'll land safely back on earth by tomorrow."
libra,2014-09-13,"Forget about reading a map to see where you are going now. Your key planet Venus is receiving thunderbolts from unstable Uranus, prompting you to feel a bit out of whack. Although others can't seem to settle into a routine today, you can escape their erratic energy by pursuing your goals instead. Remember the adrenaline rush you experience when you're in motion. Your thoughts and feelings are running one step ahead of your actions. Enjoy the excitement of self-discovery while it lasts."
scorpio,2014-09-13,"It's as if your mind is racing on an open road without a speed limit, yet every now and then there is a sharp turn that suddenly appears with no warning. Luckily, there's no cause for alarm today because your responses are quick and nothing can be put in front of you that you can't navigate. If you consciously slow your thoughts down, you may  be able to appreciate the detours of the day even more. The journey might be just as rewarding as the destination."
sagittarius,2014-09-13,"You are known among your circle of friends for your big laugh and your bold ideas. However, you're focused like a laser today on one specific thought and won't be distracted by any of the usual suspects. Additionally, it's as if someone has changed the speed on your music player and everything is running faster than normal. The weird thing is that you can still understand all the words. Thinking inside the box now is just a study in frustration. Free your mind and the rest will follow."
capricorn,2014-09-13,"A totally unexpected event could start your day with a shock. However, a sudden change of plans may open your eyes to an entirely new outlook on life. You may be intrigued with unorthodox concepts you've never thought about before. But as the day continues to unfold, try to find constructive ways to make use of all that you are learning. Let go of your preconceived ideas so you can fully embrace the future with an open heart."
aquarius,2014-09-13,"It's as if there's an electrical current running through your nervous system today making you feel more alive than ever. However, it may be challenging to stay grounded in your body. The planets are singing your favorite tune now and your brain is buzzing with snap, crackle and pop as stimulating thoughts explode into awareness. A sensible strategy is to seek out other like-minded eccentrics with whom you can travel to the edges of the universe. Learning to fly is easier in a flock."
pisces,2014-09-13,"Sometimes you are more comfortable with your dreams and fantasies when they don't have any words to confuse the message. However, all forms of written and verbal communication are in the spotlight today. There's no escape from the high-frequency mental chit-chat that continues to follow you around. You might as well resign yourself to spending the day in your hyperactive world. Just remember that the noise is coming from within, regardless of how it seems. Take a risk and share your thoughts if you want any peace of mind."
aries,2014-09-14,"Your intuition tells you to follow your feelings today, even if you don't know where they might take you. You are uncomfortable with the idea of giving up your freedom, yet this seems to be a relatively small sacrifice now for establishing a magical connection with a magnetic person. It's a gamble to put your eggs in one basket, but the potential to receive sweet satisfaction in return makes the risk worthwhile."
taurus,2014-09-14,"Emotional fulfillment isn't only about feeling good today; it's also about aligning with a higher purpose. Fortunately, accomplishing your goals is currently a breeze if your head and your heart are on the same page. You know exactly what you must do to attract prosperity and love, so don't let past dilemmas limit your current opportunities. Dream as big as you possibly can and grab the brass ring when given the chance."
gemini,2014-09-14,"Slowing down enough to sink into your emotions is challenging, especially if you're afraid of what you might discover. Nevertheless, you could be drawn into the dark recesses of your imagination today, where a clever turn of phrase won't be sufficient to bring you back into the light. Recognizing distractions for what they are now empowers you to ignore them at will. Negativity dissipates if you can find the courage to be patient. Buried treasures await your discovery if you're willing to dig deep enough."
cancer,2014-09-14,"You are ready to step up to the plate and help others overcome their fears today. You have already wrestled with your own inner demons and are eager to put your experience to good use. Although you don't have all the answers, you're willing to assist the process for someone else without feeling threatened yourself. Don't underestimate the commitment that is required; this is intense emotional work and your compassion will be greatly appreciated."
leo,2014-09-14,"It's no simple matter to find an uplifting story in the midst of an intense encounter today. However, your persistent quest might just uncover important realizations that dramatically improve your day. Though you're learning new ways to maintain your emotional health now, your current lesson may be an unexpected one. You have not picked an easy path, but delving beneath the surface can change your perspective and bring you a whole new point of view."
virgo,2014-09-14,"Your passion is a source of power now and even a challenging obstacle won't likely take your mind off your need to express your feelings. Naturally, you wish to concentrate your efforts on managing practical issues that arise, but don't want to leave your emotions unacknowledged today. Thankfully, your critical thinking enables you to see through your own camouflage and effectively cut to the chase. Sharing your heart brings you closer to those you love."
libra,2014-09-14,"Although you might try to avoid being pulled into a complex emotional drama today, it proves nearly impossible if it raises a familiar issue. Fortunately, the present circumstances are quite different from your past, yet you are reminded of a previous power struggle when you weren't necessarily in control of your feelings. Don't look back or your fears may prevent you from making the best decisions. Any possibility you put your mind to now has the potential of becoming real."
scorpio,2014-09-14,"Your power comes from your amazing ability to undergo an unexpected metamorphosis. Now that transformative Pluto harmonizes with magnetic Venus, you can manifest the magic symbolized by the Phoenix, a mythical bird that arises from the ashes of destruction. People might be afraid of your dynamic changes, but you instinctively realize it's futile to resist these cosmic waves of evolution. Being smart enough to relinquish control and drift with the cosmic flow is a sign of strength today, not weakness."
sagittarius,2014-09-14,"Although you may disagree with the conclusion of someone else's story, it's not productive to argue about a simple difference of opinion. Nevertheless, explaining your beliefs allows you to distinguish them from the hard facts. Making this differentiation is quite helpful now, and reduces your chances of fighting about a subject where there will never be a clear winner. Ironically, avoiding a confrontation today might be the only way you can emerge victorious."
capricorn,2014-09-14,"No one is going to sweet talk you into throwing in the towel today, but you could actually perform some gentle persuasion yourself. Unfortunately, if you feel like you have too much to lose, you may revert to sheer stubbornness as a last resort. Don't waste energy trying to protect the status quo; instead go out and do something creative in order to stir up the energy. Others will appreciate you making the first move."
aquarius,2014-09-14,"Anything you keep to yourself today carries more weight than the thoughts and feelings you reveal. However, this awkward dynamic is not a permission slip to share everything with everybody. There are many things that are best left unspoken now. Think about your motives before you speak and then consciously choose the best time to talk. If your intentions are clear, your communication will  bring an important issue out into the open where it can be dealt with once and for all."
pisces,2014-09-14,"Your current analytical approach triggers an important decision about a relationship today. However, you might feel as if you are temporarily lost in a desert in search of an oasis. Although you exhibit strength of purpose in your choices, a lack of commitment to your larger set of goals could be problematic. The best way to find your bearings is to listen to what's in your head while also following your heart."
aries,2014-09-15,"Apologizing doesn't come easily to you, yet it may be crucial now to overcome your need to always being right. It's healthy to acknowledge you still have a bit of growing to do. However, it's not enough to simply say you're sorry, you have to feel it from the heart. To truly get in touch with your emotions you'll need to stop and listen to the subtle messages behind the endless stream of words. Oddly enough, admitting that you're wrong brings you closer to others."
taurus,2014-09-15,"You want to concentrate on the good news today rather than focusing on feelings of insecurity. Project optimism and confidence now, even if your mind keeps cycling back to your unspoken fears. Your concerns may be valid, but you'll only make matters worse if you believe that you can handle your problems without involving someone you love. Keeping the channels of communication open is a positive catalyst for lasting change."
gemini,2014-09-15,"You might talk up a storm today, but your chattiness could just be an effective way to cover up your emotional vulnerability. You may not have as much self-confidence as others think, but there's no reason to hide the truth. Instead of trying to impress others with your cleverness, just be honest about your feelings. Thankfully, your innate flexibility enables you to learn something new if you simply remember to be quiet and listen."
cancer,2014-09-15,"You could stir up trouble today by imagining people aren't telling you the whole story. Your fears may be magnified if others have little or nothing to say, but it might be your own emotional reserve that encourages them to act similarly. Rather than asking lots of questions to show your interest, take a risk and share a bit about your own personal history first. Expressing your vulnerability is the fastest way to get the conversation flowing."
leo,2014-09-15,"One of the ways you can honor the service-oriented Virgo Sun is to set aside any self-centered feelings. Naturally, it's important to have enough confidence to successfully start a new project, but too much focus on yourself isn't healthy. Disperse some of the imbalance by shifting your attention to your friends and associates. Ultimately, it's more efficient now to work as equals, even if you are actually running the show. Aiming the spotlight on others allows your spirit of generosity to shine."
virgo,2014-09-15,"Someone might try to persuade you that you're doing the right thing, but you're not convinced. Part of your predicament is that you can vacillate on nearly any decision today, possibly creating chaos in your schedule. Don't let your self-judgment call the shots; instead, look at the situation from a more objective point of view. Envisioning yourself as an integral part of the big picture reduces any temporary feelings of isolation."
libra,2014-09-15,"You may be operating under the illusion that whatever you create now is artistically sound, even if it's not of practical value. However, it's counterproductive to justify your work based on the opinions of others. Even if you receive harsh criticism later, you will still learn a valuable lesson from your current experience. The best way to discover what's possible is to simply do it."
scorpio,2014-09-15,"You're rarely interested in messing around with shallow conversations or frivolous activities that sidetrack you from more meaningful interactions. Today is no exception as you strive to experience the full intensity of life. Ironically, you might not want to get your hands dirty in the process since the Sun is in tidy Virgo. Keep in mind that exerting emotional control could ultimately turn it into exactly what you're attempting to avoid. Take your gloves off and dive in."
sagittarius,2014-09-15,"Although you may start the day in a rather easygoing mood, a friend or partner can get under your skin, eventually provoking you to snap. Be smart and don't try to hide your annoyance right from the start because it grows more disruptive if you bury it. Denying your feelings is not  currently a viable strategy. Express your frustration calmly today; everyone will feel better once the air is cleared and peace is restored."
capricorn,2014-09-15,"You don't want to let your emotions stand in the way of your ambitions, but your irrepressible fantasies might lead you down a dead-end path today. Thankfully, you can negate your unrealistic expectations by asking questions and then listening carefully to the feedback you receive. Integrating critical information now increases your efficiency at work while helping you to be more successful in the long run."
aquarius,2014-09-15,"Others tend to see you as less pragmatic than you actually are today. Although you yearn for the ideal because you want everything to be beautiful, there are limits even to your colorful daydreams. An imaginative view of the world based on obsessive thinking isn't necessarily helpful, so don't get so wrapped up in your own thoughts that you miss the beauty that's right in front of your nose. Deal with the truth today rather than waiting until damage is done."
pisces,2014-09-15,"You are eager to handle a tricky situation by quickly swinging into action now, even if you don't have a practical plan in place yet. Although you may not be the impulsive type, your idealism can inspire you to react without thinking about the consequences. Nevertheless, you are wise to reevaluate your options prior to committing to any one path today. Postpone the most critical decisions until you have had sufficient time to consider where your current strategy will take you. Better safe than sorry."
aries,2014-09-16,"Although you might wish you could lay low as the passive Cancer Moon moves through your 4th House of Security, your key planet Mars energizes your 9th House of Adventure, activating your wanderlust. Ultimately, your frustration level will be intolerable if you can't get out and fulfill your need for an adrenaline rush. But you may be so eager for some action that you take off before you even know your destination. Your enthusiasm is admirable, but it's smarter to make a sensible game plan before you dash out the door."
taurus,2014-09-16,"All of a sudden you're so busy that you might not  have enough time to catch your breath. You may even feel a bit anxious about fulfilling your current stack of obligations today. Thankfully, you should be able to keep up with your hectic schedule if you make a plan and stick to it. If you're not sure about the best way to handle a particular situation, trust your instincts; let common sense be your guide."
gemini,2014-09-16,"You are contemplating a major change in your lifestyle these days. Thankfully, the hypersensitive Cancer Moon gives you an uncanny knack for seeing what's just beyond the horizon. But catching a glimpse of the future now isn't enough; you also have to take direct action. Don't just go back for another round of analysis today; announce your intentions and then prove your commitment by rolling up your sleeves and getting down to business."
cancer,2014-09-16,"Don't assume that you can get anyone else to help you with your work today. Even if you want to get others involved in your project, you're better off now to undertake it on your own. Going solo may not be your notion of an ideal situation, but it is much better than partnering with the wrong person at this time. Do the groundwork first and then find the right people to support your efforts later  when you have more resources at your disposal."
leo,2014-09-16,"You may feel the need to retreat in order to reconnect with your dreams and there's no reason to deny your preference today even if you have promises to keep. Following your desires isn't always the most intelligent thing to do, but it could certainly have a positive impact now. Focus your attention on the present moment, even if you are tempted to look ahead to what's next. Additionally, eliminating attachments to the past adds to the power of now."
virgo,2014-09-16,"Although you might be dreaming about an exotic getaway to a faraway destination today, the current cosmos encourage you to concentrate your energy on responsibilities closer to home. Fortunately, you can rely on your ability to communicate clearly and objectively as long as you make a concentrated effort to limit the topics of discussion. Avoid the temptation of talking about your fantasies, however vivid and captivating they may be now. Setting priorities enables you to deliver your very best."
libra,2014-09-16,"You want to offer your assistance to nearly everyone you know, but the simple truth is that you're struggling to just take care of yourself today. Although it may feel uncomfortable, it's necessary to be selfish if you want to have anything left over to give others. There's no reason to be too hard on yourself, especially if you're just trying to create a healthy balance that works. The rest of the world can fend for itself more than you think."
scorpio,2014-09-16,"You may be feeling self-sufficient today, yet your desire to detach from others can bring some pitfalls. One problem is that a trusted friend might see you as unable to ask for help or unwilling to receive it. Keep in mind that you don't have to give up your coveted independence to receive emotional support. Letting someone else slip through your defensive boundaries and into your life could bring you more joy than you expect."
sagittarius,2014-09-16,"You're acting as if you've had an extra dose of caffeine today because your energy level is buzzing from active Mars gaining traction in your exuberant sign. Your enthusiasm can soar even higher now if you are able to let go of your past. Mars remains in your sign for six weeks, recharging your batteries and supplying you with extra passion and stamina. It's your time to start something fabulous. Don't wait for another invitation from the cosmos; this is it."
capricorn,2014-09-16,"You're able to strike a balance between reasonable caution and radical thought today. However, it's not easy to keep your final goal in sight if you meet resistance. Don't give up, even if others tell you that your plans are too unrealistic now. Stay in the game by sharing your new ideas with someone you trust. Be persistent; one of them will hit the proverbial nail on the head."
aquarius,2014-09-16,"You're seeking opportunities to explore your intuitive realms today, but you must remain practical about meeting your obligations. Thankfully, you won't have to endlessly analyze the details of your day, for everything is more on track than you expected. Nevertheless, it's wise to work out the timing of your schedule in advance so you'll be more prepared for the unexpected twists and turns you encounter along the way. Ironically, being flexible works best when you already have a practical plan in place."
pisces,2014-09-16,"Your creativity is out of bounds today with the Moon lighting up your 5th House of Self-Expression. However, you could be so eager to get your personal projects up and running that your performance at work slips. Luckily, supportive lunar aspects can help you smooth over the rough spots, but you might inadvertently make matters worse by taking on too much. Limit your promises to avoid unnecessary problems later on. Establish emotional security so your inner child can come out and play."
aries,2014-09-17,"You're riding on a wave of excitement today but even though you are thrilled, you might be happier if you had more control of the present circumstances. Thankfully, you do have power over some things, but there are still issues that are beyond your authority. Don't bother wasting your precious time attempting to change something that is out of reach; instead, focus on responding to the shifting currents as best as you can. Maximize your overall effectiveness by adjusting your priorities throughout the day."
taurus,2014-09-17,"You might not feel very motivated today. However, you can be quite productive if you stop scheming to get time off. Ironically, you may actually enjoy doing mundane chores around the office or at home once you find your groove. Now is not the time to seek approval from anyone else, since your coworkers won't likely tell you what you want to hear today. Ironically, working solely for the deep satisfaction of a job well done brings admiration from others."
gemini,2014-09-17,"You can sense the anticipation in the air today as long as you're not afraid of trying something new and different. Although you are often  easygoing in your approach, you could be overly concerned today about getting every little thing right. If you relax your expectations you can still achieve your goals while having fun. Push yourself past your limits, but don't take yourself too seriously in the process."
cancer,2014-09-17,"You are tempted to take on so much responsibility today that you might feel discouraged once you realize that you can't complete everything you started. Thankfully, the current solution is rather simple: exercise caution prior to making another time-consuming commitment. Begin a new project slowly and build momentum as you go along for the best results. For now, it's better to promise less and deliver more."
leo,2014-09-17,"Financial matters could be confusing now as uncertainty about a looming decision rises to the surface. You are moving through tricky territory, intrigued by a money-making scheme. Or, perhaps, you may be trying to justify a major purchase. In either case, you feel anxiety because the solution isn't clear. Your sense of urgency can push you to make an impulsive choice you might later regret. Remove the pressure by delaying your response for a few days. If the opportunity passes, then it's best to just let it go; time is on your side."
virgo,2014-09-17,"You like to think of everything in advance, but all the prior research in the world can't prepare you for the surprising twists and turns that your life is currently taking. However, don't get too caught up with the demands of the present moment or you might forget about your original intention. Remember, the issues aren't black and white now since setting your old plans aside enables you to be even more effective in executing your new ones."
libra,2014-09-17,"Someone could catch you off guard today by overreacting to what you say or do, but you might not be aware of the behind-the-scenes story. Don't turn into a chronic naysayer just because you're uncomfortable with another person who chooses a different approach from yours. Even if people seem brash, remember that you can be gracious enough to allow for the wide variety of personalities you encounter. Taking the high road now may be more beneficial than you expect."
scorpio,2014-09-17,"You might feel rather impatient today, yet your spontaneity is counterbalanced by your unrelenting drive to finish anything you start. It would be a severe mistake for anyone to assume that you're all talk now, even if you have a lot to say. Back up your promises with clear and decisive action while focusing on getting your work completed as quickly as possible. You don't have anything to prove to anyone but yourself."
sagittarius,2014-09-17,"You may be experiencing a high-frequency state of anxiety now, but some of your intensity is less than apparent. There may be more to the big picture than meets the eye as social Venus creates an awkward aspect to non-conformist Uranus. However, your creativity is irrepressible today. Hitting the gym or taking a long walk may be an ideal strategy to get your mojo flowing and start things moving in the right direction."
capricorn,2014-09-17,"You're tired of struggling to stay on top when everything seems to be working against you. However, denial isn't a viable strategy; you certainly don't want to fall asleep at the wheel, only to discover that you missed a significant opportunity. Your greatest challenge is to believe that everything really could get easier from this point on. Whether or not the hardest part is over, you can set your life back on track by visualizing a bright future in the present moment."
aquarius,2014-09-17,"You have a clear idea of how you'd like to spend your time today until someone crosses your path with an entirely different agenda. Your immediate reaction might be to explain why your plan is the better course of action. However, you only create more problems if you set up a competitive situation where there can only be one winner. Thankfully, establishing common ground enables everyone to work together successfully as a team. Cooperation is smarter than opposition."
pisces,2014-09-17,"You really don't want anyone telling you what to do today, especially since your mind is already made up. Nevertheless, it's still best to avoid open conflict now by imagining what would be possible if everyone involved was truly on the same page. However, don't let others push you too far, especially if their core values are vastly different from yours. Give them a fair warning and then take whatever action is required to maintain your integrity."
aries,2014-09-18,"You may be disappointed by the way things are turning out today, but you're probably in better shape than you realize if you can let go of your previous expectations. You will have more opportunities later on to bring your day-to-day obligations into alignment with your high ideals. Now is the time to exercise self-restraint and deliver on what you've already promised rather than just moving on to what's next. Happily, your future looks brighter once you have handled unfinished business from the past."
taurus,2014-09-18,"You could inadvertently take on way too much today because you may underestimate the size of a job. Part of the problem is that you can't let go of a project until it feels right, so you may spend time going back over your previous work. Although others won't likely notice the difference, it's important that you honor your own need for excellence. Your best bet might be to postpone some chores for another day. Quality counts now more than ever; your reputation is on the line."
gemini,2014-09-18,"Slowing the pace of your work may not sound like the smartest thing to do, but it's wise to rest now when you have the chance. Unfortunately, you can't just declare today a personal holiday, so focus your energy on what you absolutely must accomplish before treating yourself to a bit of time off. Considering the long road you have ahead of you, replenishing your energy along the way is a good idea. This is a marathon, not a sprint."
cancer,2014-09-18,"The evocative Moon is rattling your 1st House of Self, taking you on a wild emotional ride. Stay unattached to every thought as it comes and goes. Don't push away anger and don't pull in the desires. Just allow your feelings to run their own course without trying to control them. However, this doesn't mean that you must share your inner process with those around you. Observing your journey from a slightly detached point of view teaches you a valuable lesson."
leo,2014-09-18,"Although you Lions are known for your dramatic self-expression, putting your thoughts out in the open might prove to be too much trouble today. Once you let one little feeling escape, the windows to your soul are thrown open and all your emotions could come pouring out. Even if you think you have solid boundaries in place, it may be hard to stop midstream. Err on the side of caution now and keep your secrets to yourself."
virgo,2014-09-18,"You could be so concerned about what your friends are thinking of you now that you work yourself into a state of anxiety. The reflective Cancer Moon's presence in your 11th House of Social Engagements prompts you to feel as if someone doesn't want to include you in their social group. But it's your heightened sensitivity and not anyone else's negative judgment that actually motivates your self-protective tactics. Even if you're afraid to express your vulnerability today, try to remain receptive to the overtures of others."
libra,2014-09-18,"Some of your objective thoughts might need to be hidden from view today because analysis leads you to one conclusion while your heart says something else. You can almost convince yourself that you don't have to become entangled in someone else's affairs. However, after considering all the rational reasons to retreat, toss them aside and do what feels best. Your gut won't steer you wrong now if you keep your ego out of the picture."
scorpio,2014-09-18,"Your romantic dreams can be realized today if you counterbalance tender expression with an air of detachment. It's not that you want to avoid an intimate connection with someone special, it's just that you also need your personal space. Be careful; you could get caught in the middle as you try to sort out this internal conflict. Make it easier on everyone by refraining from extreme reactions either way. Sharing your heart isn't as scary as you think."
sagittarius,2014-09-18,"Seek the simplest way out of an emotionally awkward situation today by practicing the fine art of procrastination. Although this isn't often considered to be a healthy strategy, avoiding conflict and delaying an important decision could be your smartest move now. Letting events take their own course lessens the intensity, allowing the resistance to naturally dissipate on its own. Give things a day or two and then try again."
capricorn,2014-09-18,"You can see the work piling up in front of you, but your inclination is to remain quiet rather than expressing your concerns. You may be guardedly optimistic because you have confidence in your skills, even if you realize that accomplishing your goals won't be easy. Don't waste time; start clearing the obstacles that are in your path so you can make it to the top of the mountain where you belong."
aquarius,2014-09-18,"It's tricky to find your rhythm today because whatever you do, it feels like something's off-kilter. Oddly enough, this subtle discomfort motivates you to take care of many little tasks that remain unfinished. Instead of complaining about all your work, transform your annoyance into action with a little help from your friends. Leaning on someone you can trust sets you back on solid ground. Everyone needs a little friendly encouragement now and then."
pisces,2014-09-18,"It's not that anything in particular is wrong today; it's just that you don't have the luxury of saying what's on your mind. Sharing your real concerns might send someone else into an emotional tailspin, which would only make your day more challenging. Thankfully, you can step up to the plate and help others feel more comfortable with their feelings. Instead of rocking the boat now, be a hero by bringing stability into the lives of those you love."
aries,2014-09-19,"Your intuition tells you that everything is coming up roses in the very near future. You might need to wait a while longer, but the current circumstances that have been holding you back are in the process of changing. Although it seems you have little to say today about what will happen next, it's crucial to voice your desires anyhow. If you don't stand up and speak your truth now, you could miss this window of opportunity. She who hesitates is lost."
taurus,2014-09-19,"You may be stuck in an outdated emotional pattern today, yet you know that the resistance you face won't last. Nevertheless, this lack of progress can still be quite frustrating, making it more important than ever to rely on your common sense. Consider what you want to change in your life, and then share your concerns with your partner or a friend who will tell you the truth. Communicating your apprehensions helps you to remove the obstacles from your path. Out with the old and in with the new."
gemini,2014-09-19,"Although your enthusiasm might have recently faded a bit, your outlook could improve rapidly today. The dark clouds are dissipating and you are ready to head out for a little adventure. Tread carefully, since even the simplest distraction along the way can catch you off guard. However, trying to avoid the unexpected is a waste of energy, a break in your routine could be exactly what you need. There's something to be said for the element of surprise."
cancer,2014-09-19,"Hopefully, you can set aside some private time this weekend for yourself. You are so skilled at taking care of others that sometimes you forget your own needs in the process. Unfortunately, you can't be everything to everyone. If your emotional batteries are drained now, then you may have nothing left to give. Put yourself at the top of the list for a change and do something special that makes your heart happy."
leo,2014-09-19,"You can't help but sense the power of the soulful Moon once she settles into your sign for a couple of days. Make the most of this lunar visit by taking time to sink into your own emotional world. Be still and let your intuition be your guide, even if you prefer doing something more physically active. Sometimes stopping to smell the flowers can change your whole perspective on life."
virgo,2014-09-19,"It may seem like everyone is working against you now, but it's not easy to put your finger on the reason. It might not be very significant, but if you do feel like you are missing something, rest assured that this is a real possibility. Don't waste precious time trying to find the solution out there. Instead, look inside yourself for something obvious that you previously overlooked. Oddly enough, adjusting your perspective can make the apparent problem disappear."
libra,2014-09-19,"You are eager to make new connections with others today and you're anticipating spending time with a group of like-minded friends. If you don't have particular plans in mind, take a leisurely stroll in a public park or explore a local museum. Whatever you do, get out and surround yourself with people, for temporarily losing yourself in a crowd can put you into a much more optimistic frame of mind."
scorpio,2014-09-19,"You could be coerced onto center stage whether you like it or not, but you do appreciate that others are openly admiring your work. It's gratifying to be recognized by your peers, even if you grow uncomfortable when excess attention is showered on you. Thankfully, there's no need to go into hiding. Instead, find a compromise between the heat of the spotlight and the cold, dark closet. It's perfectly acceptable to feel proud of yourself when you deserve it."
sagittarius,2014-09-19,"You tend to bounce back quickly from disappointment because you see the glass half-full rather than half-empty. Today, as the sky clears, try to get out and do something that will add more joy to your life. Whether it's going to a concert or taking a long hike out in the country, find a way to recharge your soul. Better yet, bring a friend along and talk about what ails you. Expressing your vulnerability activates healing and the potential for more intimate connections."
capricorn,2014-09-19,"Although you're confident that your plans will come true, you also are feeling some urgency about sharing what's on your mind. This doesn't mean that you must share everything your thinking today with other. No matter what you do, the road not taken may seem the better choice retrospectively. Don't judge your decisions so harshly. You are where you are now for a reason, determine your lesson and move on to what's next."
aquarius,2014-09-19,"Someone may make excessive demands on your schedule now and you might not know what to do about it. Of course, you want to come through with the goods, since you know this would smooth over the rough spots. Nevertheless, it's not constructive to jump through hoops just for the effect. Fortunately, you can still be gracious while setting healthy boundaries. Ultimately, it's essential to remain true to your heart."
pisces,2014-09-19,"You might be required to produce further details about your ideas today, but these demands could annoy you rather than inspire you. Others may miss the fact that you are not particularly interested in the finer points now. Instead, you are content to let the little things take shape on their own. Still, demonstrating your good intentions by making a sincere effort to focus could strengthen your overall position within the group."
aries,2014-09-20,"Schedule your social plans wisely because you may inadvertently commit to conflicting engagements. It might be that there are more events happening today than you can attend and it's nearly impossible to narrow your selection. Nevertheless, it's best to cut back on non-essential activities, so don't put too much energy into second-guessing yourself once you've made up your mind. Your first choice is your best choice."
taurus,2014-09-20,"Family members or close friends may now be the source of your current dilemma as they offer you an idea that seems attractive at first. However, upon closer scrutiny, the opportunity turns out to be one of those schemes that looks a lot better than it actually is. Be careful of jumping into any situation with both feet, since you might not have a quick way back to stable ground. Take your time before responding, and don't burn any bridges in the process."
gemini,2014-09-20,"Your lack of motivation could mean you don't get a whole lot of work done today. You like the idea of a repose, but your hectic schedule may not allow you the time for one today. The good news is that you have a real opportunity for growth in front of you, but you must push beyond your comfort zone in order to make the most of it. You will never know what can happen if you don't try."
cancer,2014-09-20,"Receiving unexpected praise boosts your confidence today. Unfortunately, there are surprises lurking behind even the most attractive situations, which could muddle your emotions and obscure your sense of direction. In fact, your self-esteem may go through a few ups and downs today. Don't let self-doubt get the best of you; maintaining a positive attitude impacts your future in a powerful way."
leo,2014-09-20,"Your current inclination is to convince others that everything is fine, but this may not be the whole truth. You are captivated by daydreams of romantic love and sensual enjoyment. Shake things up today and share your fantasies with a sweetheart or close friend. Though complete satisfaction may not be attainable, now is not the time to hide your true feelings. You'll never know what magic you could experience until you open your heart."
virgo,2014-09-20,The cosmic tides are pushing you to bring your unexpressed needs out into the open today so you can finally fulfill your desires. Keep in mind you are better off delivering your message with a sugar coating for it to have the impact you desire. It's crucial to remain gracious and kind in all your communications now if you want a shot at manifesting your dreams.
libra,2014-09-20,"Your creativity is often in the spotlight as you seek ways to reflect the beauty around you, both in your interactions with others and in what you choose to create. Pay attention to the pragmatic side of your life today as you weave your magic to produce a positive impact on your own personal appearance and your self-esteem. You don't need to turn your world upside down. Small changes are the ones that last the longest."
scorpio,2014-09-20,"Your personal relationships might be a formidable source of confusion now. You know what you want, but it's not clear how to achieve it. You're willing to sort out your feelings, but a fog is rolling in and it's nearly impossible to obtain reliable emotional bearings. Wait until the time is right before following your heart. Achieving emotional fulfillment will be easier once the illusions clear and you can see where you're going."
sagittarius,2014-09-20,"Your dreams of the future are a source of personal inspiration today. You might be so enamored with your exciting plans that you take every chance you can to share them with others. You're passionate about your vision and assume everyone else feels the same. However, this dynamic is more complicated now than you realize, leaving you dazed and confused. Reveal a little less and smile a little more today."
capricorn,2014-09-20,"You welcome boundaries as they help you define your plan of action. When everything is neat and tidy you know exactly what you need to do, and you do it. But the edges of reality seem fuzzy today and things appear softer and more innocent. Intuitively, you know that you are looking at your life through the eyes of your inner child. Remember, just a small acknowledgment of reality will go a long way to sustain your dreams."
aquarius,2014-09-20,"Significant changes are about to rock your boat and shake you awake. You probably don't have a clue yet about what is going to develop. Just ride the tides of your emotions as they go back and forth without acting on your feelings until the currents return to normal. Demonstrating your Aquarius resolve empowers you to overcome your uncertainty. Fortunately, your chances for success improve when you act with conviction."
pisces,2014-09-20,"You can be swept up in someone else's drama today without even realizing what's happening. Additionally, an unstable work situation could magnify your sense of surrealism. You may even set goals based upon your fantasies, rather than what is actually attainable. Be careful because you could miss an opportunity for personal growth if you misinterpret current events. Focus on realizing your potential and quit trying to save everyone else."
aries,2014-09-21,"It's usually prudent to have a concrete plan in place prior to starting a big project. However, your need to have your ducks in a row could prevent you from gaining any progress today. Setting meaningful goals is helpful, but it's pointless to fill in all the steps too soon. A flexible attitude enables you to utilize your experience when responding to the changing circumstances. Having a general strategy as a guiding light is more productive now than nailing down all the details in advance."
taurus,2014-09-21,"Instead of letting the expectations of others rule you today, you might slip away for a bit of fun and games. You're tired of playing the role of someone's moral compass during an emotional storm and need to redirect your attention toward satisfying your own needs. Your key planet Venus is activating your 5th House of Play, adding a layer of sweetness to activities that are usually quite routine or even boring. Let someone else come up with solutions; even if they are not as solid as yours, you'll be free to chase your creative pursuits."
gemini,2014-09-21,"You could be a bit confused about your goals if your dreams linger even after you wake today. You might not want to undertake projects that require too much physical exertion. Instead of trying to control the external circumstances, contemplate which feelings to let go without remaining attached to a specific outcome. This meditative practice helps you align with the nurturing energy all around you."
cancer,2014-09-21,"You are in a familiar loop today, and might become deeply involved in an emotional concern, probably not of your own making. You have a tendency to judge others based upon your own personal values, but don't let your assumptions prevent you from supporting those you love. Your sympathy and caring spirit could be exactly what the doctor ordered to help your friends through a difficult time."
leo,2014-09-21,"You are attracted to the idea of being fair-minded today, but may find it challenging to act on your good intentions. Part of your current dilemma stems from not knowing how much you should get involved in other people's affairs. Fulfilling your own desires is not your top priority now, leading you to become emotionally entangled in the drama of the moment. Tread carefully and conserve your resources for when you really need them."
virgo,2014-09-21,"You might be so concerned about the reactions of others that you are cautious about expressing your feelings today. A brief hesitation is probably sensible in the moment because it gives you additional time to make the best possible decision. Unfortunately, you could talk yourself into doing more research just to avoid choosing one path over another. However, procrastination is not a viable option; ultimately, taking any action is better than doing nothing at all."
libra,2014-09-21,"Withholding information works in your favor now, but if you choose to reveal your feelings it must be done with good intentions and a high level of integrity. Keeping a secret is something you do well today, yet your unwillingness to share might backfire on you. Fortunately, your current discretion is healthy while authoritative Saturn aligns with vulnerable Venus. Decide what your limits are and don't let anyone talk you into saying any more than you want."
scorpio,2014-09-21,"Expanding your horizons by furthering your education is a smart idea. You have considerable planning to do today in order to reach your goals. Thankfully, whatever you learn now can be very useful to you later on, especially in order to advance in your career. But don't obsess about the cost or the commitment of time; just move ahead as if it will happen. You must believe in your dreams if they are to come true; you can always figure out the details later."
sagittarius,2014-09-21,"You think you can trust your intuition, but impulsive behavior based on a gut feeling won't serve you well today. Instead of making up your plans as you go along, put some forethought into your actions prior to doing anything out of the ordinary. Stick with the facts to avoid fooling yourself with any pie-in-the-sky thinking. Playing it low key now allows you to shift into high gear once the pace picks up. Conserving your energy until the timing is right heightens your chances for success."
capricorn,2014-09-21,"Although you are usually production-oriented, your practicality is off the charts today. Naturally, you want to acknowledge your desire to get ahead now that resourceful Venus is blowing an encouraging kiss to your key planet Saturn. Nevertheless, it's also important to be open to pleasant experiences that may have nothing to do with your professional ambitions. Sometimes the most valuable gifts are those that cannot be measured."

Things are not as they appear now; an obstacle might be a blessing in disguise."
pisces,2014-09-21,"You may believe that you have invented or discovered a new and improved way to do the same old thing.

Pursue your creativity and see where it goes; there's no time like the present to make something magical happen."
aries,2014-09-22,"It may seem like a hopeless battle today as your schedule goes up in smoke. Good intentions don't pave the road to success; instead, they can encourage your workmates to set unrealistic expectations about your productivity. Thankfully, you don't have to let others down if you are cautious about inflating your dreams in the first place. There's nothing wrong with thinking big as long as you maintain a healthy perspective about what is really possible. Promise less and deliver more."
taurus,2014-09-22,"Riding a wave of creativity feels empowering, but you might end up being disappointed if the end result doesn't fit your larger plan. There's no room for your pipe dreams now; you must bring your visions down to earth. You can achieve satisfaction if you can manage to stay grounded. You might feel as if you're running out of time, but you're not. Instead of panicking because you think you're approaching a deadline, imagine you're just shifting gears and taking control of the journey."
gemini,2014-09-22,"Maintaining your focus on one specific project can be challenging when there are so many interesting opportunities calling your name. However, this isn't the time to scatter your energy; for the best results you should limit your options. Establishing priorities helps you decide where to best apply your energy now. Instead of dreaming about what you want to do, put all your concentration on the tasks at hand. Exercising self-restraint today sets the stage for expanding your range of vision over the days ahead."
cancer,2014-09-22,"There's a lot going on in your life now, but not so much that it becomes unmanageable. Thankfully, you can make the most of the day by adopting a dual approach; keep one eye on the exciting potential of the future while focusing the other on making the most of the present moment. Envisioning your ideal situation at work or at home is fine as long as you acknowledge the power of now.

leo,2014-09-22,"You can have a powerful influence on those closest to you today as benevolent Jupiter highlights your 1st House of Personality. Your optimism is contagious and inspires others without much effort on your part. However, you may be so enthusiastic that you overstate your case or oversell your cause.

When others are able to see your talent, they can give you the support you desire."
scorpio,2014-09-22,"Although it feels good to lighten up and enjoy the company of your peers, you are hesitant to take things too far. Nevertheless, you can still lift others out of their doldrums as they pick up on your positive energy. Just remember, it's healthier to establish a sustainable pace than it is to burn out on extreme reactions. When you put forth a conscious effort you can find that sweet spot between connecting emotionally and engaging in too much personal drama."
sagittarius,2014-09-22,"If you are busy with community issues or your career, your recent efforts might have brought you into the public eye. Although you enjoy the admiration of your peers, it's time to step down from the pedestal and work with others as equals. The sooner you realize that you have nothing to prove, the quicker your relationships will improve. Share the glory of being a star today; when your tribe shines brighter so do you."
capricorn,2014-09-22,"Sometimes you define yourself by your accomplishments. However, you must shift your focus now and manage your social dynamics rather than your professional goals alone. If a relationship issue takes up more of your time these days, it's a sign from the cosmos that you need to reevaluate your priorities. But don't slip into denial if the tension becomes unbearable. Channel the stress into an emotional teaching moment so that you can learn an important lesson about your heart."

When you channel your enthusiasm into the tasks at hand, you'll take your productivity to a whole new level."
taurus,2014-09-23,"You might choose to pursue pleasurable experiences today, whether or not you really have the time. Practice self-discipline, since you may find that the energy you waste on a passing fancy could be put to better use creating something that will have lasting value. Thankfully, you can have the best of both worlds now by incorporating joy into your daily routine. Love what you do and you'll never work a day in your life."
gemini,2014-09-23,"You may be at odds with yourself today as you remember a recent experience and wonder if you did the right thing at the time. However, you're unable to move on to whatever is next until you fully understand what is happening in the present.

aquarius,2014-09-23,"It might seem as if you missed a chance to make something significant happen, but by tomorrow you should be all geared up to try again. Nevertheless, don't let an opportunity pass by today without giving it serious consideration. Even if your expectations don't pan out as you hope, the process of visualizing the alternatives could fire you up with a wave of enthusiasm. There's no need to worry about the outcome yet; just be ready to act with clear intention when the time is right."
pisces,2014-09-23,"Take it in stride if someone offers you an idea today that conflicts with your previous plans. Unfortunately, it's all too easy to get into an argument over something that isn't as critical as it seems. Maintaining your objectivity is crucial now because your uncharacteristic impatience creates more problems than it solves. A little bit of caution can save you from unnecessary frustration down the road. Creating a path based on compromise could turn you into the hero of the day."

Practicing the art of compromise might enrich your life in ways you can't imagine."

Nevertheless, monitoring your words allows you to express your heart without taking things too far.

Naturally, it's essential to keep your dreams alive, but it's also critical to discern the difference between fact and fancy.

It's safe to assume you are performing your job duties admirably with the Libra New Moon spotlighting your 10th House of Career.

Don't let your emotional neediness get in the way of achieving success."
aries,2014-09-25,"Although you might not be as comfortable in the emotional realms as when you are in motion, it's time to learn new ways of expression. The potential for growth may be rather subtle at first, but the long-term effects can be profound. Pay attention to any ideas that percolate into your awareness now from dreams or in meditation. The first step to gaining awareness is to slow down and seek the knowledge within. You need to stand still if you want lightning to strike."

Perhaps you are longing for a romantic adventure or a spiritual quest. However, you might also want to pursue more creative activities at work.

Don't weigh yourself down with old expectations; anything can happen if you believe in yourself."

You can get away with eccentric behaviors that might appear overwhelming at other times in your life. People seem to support you and your long-term visions now more than ever.

Your spiritual practice and emotional processing are essential keys to deepening your awareness and breaking free from unnecessary restrictions that are keeping you from expressing your vulnerability."
libra,2014-09-25,"Your feelings are quite close to the surface now, yet they may continue to evolve over the days ahead. Controlling your emotions is not the same as monitoring your reactions to others.

All your past experiences make you the person you are today."

You won't necessarily prevent the current standoff by yourself because you don't have all the facts.

Acknowledging that you don't have all the answers is the first step to finding resolution."

Summon up your courage now and let your feelings, not your logic, guide your way."

Your inner voice tells you to grit your teeth and just finish your chores, while a second voice encourages you to express your feelings in protest. You feel caught between these extreme positions and might not know what to do.

Cooperating with others relieves the pressure and sets a good example for everyone to follow."

Instead of avoiding the discomfort of vulnerability, discuss your desires with a confidant you can trust."
capricorn,2014-09-26,"You may choose to kick back today and contemplate your current position in life. Naturally, there is always something else to do and more goals to accomplish, but just spending time with friends or family brings you great joy today.

Your optimism and persistence enable you to rise above the chaos and do the right thing for everyone involved. Your talent for seeing the glass as half-full motivates others to do the same."
pisces,2014-09-26,"There's an underlying tension creating a struggle between who you want to be and what others expect from you. There may not be an easy resolution to this emotional dilemma today, but you still might believe that things will work out if you just hang on for a while longer.

People admire your skills and want to be in your company because engaging the world on multiple levels enables you to appear like a magician.

A slow and steady approach might actually help you to reach your goal even faster than you expect."

Ironically, the best thing you can do now is simply respect your friends by listening and accepting them for who they are. Don't waste energy trying to create a false sense of harmony. Set a positive example by applying your passion toward your own goals, instead."

You are receiving inspiration from unseen dimensions yet your friends could be overwhelmed by your intensity.

Some things are better left unexpressed; a mysterious smile says everything others need to know."

Instead of cleaning up after the fact, keep your words to a minimum today. No matter what anyone else says, actions speak louder than words."
aquarius,2014-09-27,"An inspirational person enters your life today, presenting you with an intriguing opportunity. You could be so eager for something new to happen that you start dreaming about all the possibilities without considering the practicalities involved. Be patient and try not to prematurely jump to any extreme conclusions. Although your conversation might not catalyze an immediate change, it could lead to something else that's ultimately a positive move."
pisces,2014-09-27,"An overly exuberant family member or roommate might be a nagging source of trouble today. Surrounding yourself with positive people is nearly always a good idea, but someone's optimism may be covering up a more complicated issue now. Nevertheless, gently asking questions could start a meaningful dialogue that evolves into a deeper discussion. Rely on your innate compassion to guide you as you step into unknown emotional territory."
aries,2014-09-28,"It seems as if your motives are under scrutiny today as someone questions your authenticity. Don't waste energy defending your intentions; just be as honest as possible and then move on. Remember, your unresolved emotions could interfere with your happiness if you do not address them as soon as they arise. The resistance will quickly dissipate and you can push past any residual awkwardness with your usual confident charm."
taurus,2014-09-28,"It's in your nature to approach life from a down-to-earth perspective, but the drama of relationship issues can require a significant amount of your time now. Even if you try to set responsible priorities in your life, you probably won't be able to avoid sensitive home and family issues today. Say what's on your mind and don't worry too much if communication seems strained at first. Others may not appreciate you starting the conversation, but clearing the air is ultimately the best for everyone involved."
gemini,2014-09-28,"People might give you a hard time today if you try to avoid the consequences of your words. Your key planet Mercury inspires you to be brutally honest now that it's swimming through Scorpio's tumultuous waters. Although you're tempted to put everything on the table, the whole truth may be too much for others to handle if you tell it all at once. The best way to ensure that you won't have to take back what you said is to stop and think before you speak."
cancer,2014-09-28,"If you find yourself squaring off with someone today, rest assured that the argument won't likely last long. Your feelings are triggering unpleasant memories, which makes the current situation feel larger than life. Thankfully, it probably won't morph into something more problematic. However, you need to acknowledge that the emotions of others have just as much validity as yours. Finding common ground starts with establishing mutual respect."
leo,2014-09-28,"You are eager to shine your light with unrestrained enthusiasm today, but you may be required to focus your attention on something that seems trivial to you. However, don't worry about what you must do now, for the sooner you take care of old business, the quicker you can return to your own agenda. There will be no allowance for sloppy work, so take your time and do it right. Not only will you please others with your penchant for perfection, but you might secretly please yourself in the process."
virgo,2014-09-28,"You might not communicate everything that needs to be said now that messenger Mercury is in Scorpio's secretive domain. In fact, you may be so concerned about making someone uncomfortable that you choose to withhold your feelings. However, you're currently not the best judge of other people's reactions because you're hypersensitive to every emotional nuance. Thankfully, your words wield more power if you wait until the right time and place to talk."
libra,2014-09-28,"An old pattern might be back on your plate as you experience the pressure of Saturn's limiting aspect to the radiant Sun. Your feelings of inadequacy are revealed, where they can magically transform into more healthy expressions. Even if you are hitting a financial wall today, remember that you could gain a lot of perspective from this cosmic challenge. Pushing past your own resistance to change is your key to success."
scorpio,2014-09-28,"Tensions arise from the raw power of your feelings. It's imperative to find a confidant who believes in your talent while the relentless Scorpio Moon motivates you to develop your plans even further. Postpone big decisions until after Luna slips into your 2nd House of Self-Esteem later in the day. Although others can help you clarify your strategy, ultimately your conscience is your best guide."
sagittarius,2014-09-28,"You Archers tend to be known as the fun-loving ones of the group, but you're feeling out of sorts today. You are more serious than playful now as you reassess your dreams and reevaluate your place in the world. Even if you disappoint someone else with your uncharacteristic somber attitude, your honest vulnerability can pave the way to stronger relationships in the long run. You will discover who your real friends are when you are not the life of the party."
capricorn,2014-09-28,"A few days of monthly emotional housekeeping may be enough to keep you on track. It's time to prune stuck negative feelings from your overgrown garden. You are being asked to cut back several aspects of your life and if you do it voluntarily, the energy will flow much easier. Remember that eliminating unhealthy patterns now creates more room for the flowers to grow in their place later on."
aquarius,2014-09-28,"You are standing on the edge of a precipice now, yet must hold your ground for the time being. You may have significant facts you want to share, but you can't tell anyone the whole story yet. If you reveal your plan prematurely, others will realize that you haven't done all your homework. Your current assumption might be missing a crucial piece of information and you must be patient until you have figured out the entire puzzle. Keep looking, you're closer to the solution than you think."
pisces,2014-09-28,"No matter which direction you Fish are swimming now, the current seems to be going the other way. Oddly enough, it feels like everyone is working against your best intentions. Whatever you do, step around the urge to sink into playing the role of a victim. You really don't have time or energy to waste on unproductive behavior. Your world is about to change and you need to be at your best to take advantage of it."
aries,2014-09-29,"You might not be very flexible today, even if you understand that being receptive to the ideas of others could teach you as much as following your own brilliant thoughts. Although your positive approach to life helps you shake off the stress, you know there's a big shift in the works now, making it nearly impossible to discern what's coming next. Nevertheless, don't be afraid to share what's in your heart, even if you scare yourself. Stick to the truth and your fears will fade sooner than you expect."
taurus,2014-09-29,"You may be at a rather significant crossroads now, yet you still want to believe that you can keep things going just as they are. The fact is that something needs to change and you're not sure who to trust with your dilemma. But even if you are ready to make your dreams come true, your emotions could become too volatile to contain today. Forget about trying to manage your feelings; embrace the unknown instead of resisting the inevitable. Life is more fun when you're open to the element of surprise."
gemini,2014-09-29,"Although you are eager to change the dynamics between you and others today, it's challenging to regain normalcy once the energy begins to shift. There could be a lot at stake in a relationship now, but don't try to force your will on anyone else. The more you attempt to control the outcome, the more distant you grow from your goals. Express your passions and remain open to the many possibilities ahead."
cancer,2014-09-29,"Your heart is fully engaged, making it tough to set limits when sharing your feelings now. Complications may arise from your insistent attention to the big picture, even as you keep getting dragged back into the details. Maintaining a positive attitude is challenging today if loose ends start to unravel. Do the best you can to work with the uncertainty for a little while longer. Taking your journey one step at a time is the safest route to your destination."
leo,2014-09-29,"It's nearly impossible to let go of your unexpressed feelings that still linger beneath the surface. Although you think everything is settled, a personal drama arises. Just when you are ready to move on, a reminder dredges up a wave of powerful emotions. Don't waste energy on fighting against the prevailing currents; instead navigate with your heart to work with the natural tides and not against them. Channel your intensity into your creativity and see what happens."
virgo,2014-09-29,"Your changing moods swing like a pendulum now, prompting you to go from focusing on the tiniest details of the day and then ponder universal concepts. Unfortunately, either extreme leads you into tricky territory as you step beyond your usual pragmatic approach. Thankfully, you can learn something of value as you move back and forth between practice and theory. Exercising your flexibility allows you to get the best of both worlds."
libra,2014-09-29,"You may as well be in the middle of a noisy crowd today as there's probably little you can do to create the relaxing atmosphere you prefer. But it's not that you are having a rough time; it's just that everything seems overly intense these days. Give yourself permission to roll with your emotions, even if you aren't as easygoing as others expect. You don't always have to be the one who makes everything all right. Oddly enough, expressing your true feelings isn't nearly as risky as you think."
scorpio,2014-09-29,"Your feelings are pulled in two directions today as you struggle with accepting the status quo. Even if you're dissatisfied with all the details of your daily routine, you can still see the positive aspects of the bigger picture.

You truly love the idea of adventure, yet you also long for peace and quiet so you can bask in the beauty of your journey. Unfortunately, you don't have the luxury of wasting time on rosy nostalgia or restless fantasies. There's too much happening now that needs your immediate attention. Keep breathing; calmer weather is on the way."
capricorn,2014-09-29,"Your stress might not be very apparent today, but that certainly doesn't mean it's nonexistent. You may believe that you're heading directly for unknown territory because you can't figure out what others are feeling. Unfortunately, the more you attempt to fill in the missing pieces of the puzzle, the more anxious you become now.

aquarius,2014-09-29,"You need to be accepted by those in your community, but you might think that they don't even know the real you. Acknowledging your role in this situation is crucial, because you may be hesitant to share your feelings if you worry too much about gaining approval from others. However, your fear of rejection could be more problematic now than what you won't disclose. Taking a risk by showing your vulnerability isn't an easy path, but it's a great start toward long-term emotional fulfillment."
pisces,2014-09-29,"You want to be appreciated and admired at work, but you may not be inclined to go the extra mile necessary to be outstanding. You're torn between your inner and outer worlds today. Pleasing others sounds so easy at first, but it grows more complicated once you actually begin the work. Don't make any commitments that you can't fulfill today."
aries,2014-09-30,"Your influence on others isn't limited only to what they can see. Placing extra emphasis on your performance may have you looking the part but won't necessarily convey the real substance of what you have to offer. Be smart and save your act for another day. For now, proactively work with the major changes that are unfolding around you. The future will be here before you know it."
taurus,2014-09-30,"Declaring your feelings out loud sounds like an easy thing to do today, even if this isn't your normal style.

Your life is already more complicated than you prefer, so don't add another layer of drama on top of everything else. For simplicity's sake, keep your desires under wraps until the time is right."
gemini,2014-09-30,"You might feel as if you recently navigated your way successfully through a tricky situation. Now that you have demonstrated your skills as a negotiator by convincing someone to avoid direct confrontation, it's your turn to take a stand for one of your beliefs. Although this may require a serious commitment on your part, you could be pleasantly surprised with the outcome if you're willing to put your integrity ahead of convenience."
cancer,2014-09-30,"You wish you could move past recently hurt feelings, but it's not easy to forget them if someone is being inconsiderate today. Still, it's crucial to realize that you can't make people react to you in a specific way, even if you're tempted to manipulate their emotions. Instead of trying to change anyone else, find a place of acceptance within yourself that can transform your fears into a positive expression of love."
leo,2014-09-30,"You are all set to put your best foot forward since you long to be noticed by those you love. Luckily, your charm cuts through most stressful situations now that the Moon is visiting your 5th House of Self-Expression, inspiring others to admire your performance. However, sometimes you can try too hard to make a positive impression. Once you have enjoyed your moment in the sun today, be gracious and give someone else a chance to shine for a while. Knowing when to step away from the spotlight is just as important as entertaining the crowd."
virgo,2014-09-30,"Your desire for adventure conflicts with your need for perfection today. You're intrigued by the idea of sacrificing quality in order to squeeze more into your day. However, you may regret this kind of foolish behavior later on. Your friends and family might not even be aware of your current struggle unless you choose to make your feelings public. Keep in mind that your experience doesn't depend on anyone else knowing about it. Ultimately, this is your personal journey and the solution must come from within."
libra,2014-09-30,"You could grow worried about an uncomfortable situation with a friend, but it's hard to tell if it's real or if you're just making it all up. Either way, the results will likely work out in your favor since the Sun aspects auspicious Jupiter in your 11th House of Social Networking.

scorpio,2014-09-30,"It feels like all the pressure is landing squarely on your shoulders now, but fortunately you know that your efforts are appreciated by those who matter the most. The uplifting Sagittarius Moon brightens your 2nd House of Self-Esteem and boosts your confidence, reminding you to look on the sunny side of things. But don't waste energy pretending that you are okay with life as it is if you're not. Being authentic counts more than anything else."
sagittarius,2014-09-30,"Unfortunately, your overconfidence can carry you away today, making you appear a bit reckless. However, the Moon's monthly visit to cavalier Sagittarius lifts your spirits and encourages you to share your optimistic outlook with those around you anyhow. It's great to have such a positive influence on others, but you could lose support from your closest friends unless you are also willing to acknowledge the more difficult aspects of life, too. Being sensitive to the full spectrum of experience opens the door to stronger relationships."
capricorn,2014-09-30,"You are motivated by your desire to reach the top of the mountain, but this ambitious goal can be nearly impossible because the ground is shifting beneath your feet now. You can see many exciting possibilities on the horizon, but are also fearful that you could lose your sense of direction if you allow yourself to be distracted by pleasure. Thankfully, you have enough discipline to stay on track today as long as you remain true to yourself."
aquarius,2014-09-30,"Although others are likely to share their feelings with you today, there's a good chance that you could misinterpret what they say. Relationships are complicated by unexpressed emotions now, especially if people think that you won't approve of their desires. Create safe space by demonstrating your willingness to be open-minded and non-judgmental if you want those you love to share their secrets with you. A good friend knows when to stop talking and when to start listening."
pisces,2014-09-30,"You can still make it look like you're having fun even if you don't feel like doing your chores or fulfilling your duties today. Your cleverness can turn your tedious routine into a game, alleviating boredom and adding more pleasure to your life. However, caution is advised because there is a price to pay for keeping your real feelings to yourself. It's wiser to be honest from the start if you want to break out of your rut."
aries,2014-10-01,You might land in a heap of trouble today if you think you should have power without first earning it. You could inadvertently set the wheels in motion on an idea that's fueled by passion rather than logic. Back up your decisions with solid facts and not your feelings if you want to reach your destination on time.
taurus,2014-10-01,"It's much easier to see the impact of the choices you make now because you aren't encumbered by other people's expectations. Your coworkers may have their own agendas, but their plans are invisible to you today because you're focused on your own goals. Nevertheless, going over your plans with someone you trust could be your wisest move at the moment. It never hurts to get a second opinion."
gemini,2014-10-01,Today you have the ability to override your tendency to become bored and restless when the topic isn't interesting to you. The truth is you can't always have the lighthearted version of reality; sometimes you must sink beneath surface appearances to reach what's truly important. You never know what treasure you might find unless you're willing to look for it.
cancer,2014-10-01,"You might find that someone you truly respect won't take the time to listen to what you have to say today. Although you're not looking for anyone to fix anything, you don't like to be cut off while you're expressing your emotions. You need your feelings to be fully acknowledged so you can rest assured that your intentions are understood. If you wait until you have a receptive audience before sharing what's on your mind, you will have a better chance of receiving what you desire."
leo,2014-10-01,"You have a specific list of tasks to finish today and you don't want anyone to distract you from your current agenda. You're highly resistant to changing your schedule just because someone else wants you to follow their lead. However, make sure that you aren't being so stubborn that you miss out on an exciting opportunity. Keeping an open mind at all times gives you the flexibility to live life to the fullest."
virgo,2014-10-01,"You know exactly what you want today and might try to involve others in ways that will be advantageous to your cause. There isn't anything wrong with your persuasive tactics as long as you don't mislead someone because of selfish motives. Remember, you are more likely to receive the support that you seek if your goals benefit everyone involved. As Aristotle claimed, ""The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."""
libra,2014-10-01,"You're quite serious about your feelings today, possibly prompting others to withdraw because they don't particularly want to be swallowed up by your intensity now. But there's no need to arbitrarily alter your path just to get someone to like you. It's essential to stay true to your core values whether or not you alienate anyone in the process. However, even if you have non-negotiable items on your agenda, kindness is always the best policy."
scorpio,2014-10-01,"Your intentions might not be very transparent to others today but ironically, this uncertainty could actually work in your favor. Of course, you can always rationalize your actions to others. However, you could gain momentum when you know that your secret plan is safe from prying eyes. Don't succumb to sharing your strategy just to please someone else. In silence there is power."
sagittarius,2014-10-01,"You may have money issues to handle today, but prefer that others stay out of your personal business. Although there's nothing to hide, you don't want to talk about your finances because you know that everyone will offer advice and you prefer to manage your affairs on your own now. However, confiding in the right person could be quite useful because a fresh perspective to your problem might be just what you need to put things in order."
capricorn,2014-10-01,"Although you might seem moody to others today, you still have a cool and calculated agenda. However, you're wearing your emotions on your sleeve now that the Moon is occupying your 1st House of Personality. You may be so sure of yourself that you create unnecessary drama if you insist on pushing other people's buttons. Paradoxically, denying your heightened emotional intensity turns you into exactly what you're trying to avoid. Let others think what they will; their opinions don't have to impact you unless you choose to let them."
aquarius,2014-10-01,"You are a walking contradiction today because you want to keep your feelings to yourself, but flying beneath the radar isn't possible now. The problem is that you have a crucial role to play and your actions are in the spotlight. However, you don't have to reveal your private emotions just because you're in the public eye. Your friendly smile may be enough to keep everyone at bay for a while longer."
pisces,2014-10-01,"If you are collaborating on a project as part of a team now, you should be extra cautious about going against the grain of the group. Naturally, you would be selling yourself short if you didn't stand up for your beliefs. However, there's no need to take everything to an extreme when expressing your feelings. Once you make your position known today, be willing to let go of it for the common good. Compromise is the key to your success."
aries,2014-10-02,"Involving others in your process is a smart idea today, even if they aren't fully supportive of your plan. However, there's no reason to express every idea you have out loud. Instead of furthering your agenda, you might be dragged into defending it. Reevaluate your goals and then push toward your destination rather than worrying about what you could have done differently. It's more effective to live in the present than to dwell on the past."
taurus,2014-10-02,"It's not easy for anyone to change your mind once you've chosen your path. Unfortunately, the most logical appeal won't work any better than an emotional one today. However, keeping an open mind might be enough to attract an ally that eventually alters your perspective in a positive way. Listening carefully to others is your smartest strategy now because there's always room for improvement."
gemini,2014-10-02,"You may be absolutely certain that you need to strike out on your own today, but it won't hurt to try to meet other people's expectations, anyhow. Don't waste your energy resisting someone else's agenda, even if your natural inclination is to stay uncommitted. Thankfully, doing what's best is easy now because your judgment is grounded by your common sense. Being practical is currently more important than remaining independent."
cancer,2014-10-02,"Taking other people's needs into consideration is critical today even if their feelings make you uncomfortable. Your fear of being vulnerable tempts you to build unnecessary walls while the Moon is sensitizing your 7th House of Partners and highlighting relationship dynamics. Even if you don't fully understand someone else's point of view, compromise is a better choice than just going off on your own. Opening your heart isn't always easy, but it's the best path for personal growth."
leo,2014-10-02,"You know what you need to do at work today, although it might seem overwhelming at first. It's a surprise when you realize that your initial plans may be different from what's actually needed. Avoiding your basic responsibilities is not a viable option. You still must fulfill your obligations sooner or later, so get them out of the way as quickly as possible to leave time for yourself later on."
virgo,2014-10-02,"Surprisingly, you're not worried about how efficient your methods are at work today. Instead, you are preoccupied with whatever makes you happy. Although narrowing your focus to finish your work is your normal modus operandi, you are more effective now if you're also having fun. Ironically, being too serious can actually be counterproductive today. Follow your heart and you might learn something new."
libra,2014-10-02,"Domestic responsibilities could be very demanding today, especially if someone's expectations are different from what you're willing to do. However, you might not be able to escape your current obligations, so there's no point in resisting the inevitable. Fortunately, you won't have to deny your desire for pleasure. Once you have taken care of your personal business you can let the good times roll."
scorpio,2014-10-02,"You're likely to be drawn into an intense emotional drama, even if you wish that you could have more unstructured time for spiritual pursuits. Being in the company of others may not be your first choice now, but you can benefit by engaging in a constructive dialogue with a close friend or trusted associate. Ironically, taking the time to process your feelings widens your horizons and opens your heart."
sagittarius,2014-10-02,"You may have to stand up to a powerful adversary today because your plan is contrary to the consensus of the group. Unfortunately, your friends or coworkers might be too quick to choose the easy way out of a difficult situation. They don't understand your resistance now as you adhere to your core values. Although your unwavering idealism is admirable, don't be so obstinate that you cannot see the common ground you're already standing on."
capricorn,2014-10-02,"You might become so obsessive about accomplishing your objectives today that you could lose track of your legendary pragmatism. The emotional Moon's return to calculating Capricorn can prompt you to turn an easy task into a big project before you know it. Don't create extra work for yourself by committing to an unrealistic strategy; instead, avoid making a bad decision by maintaining your practical approach to success no matter what."
aquarius,2014-10-02,"Your daydreams may seem as if they came right out of a science fiction movie today and appear to have no basis in reality. However, it's likely that your fantasies reveal something special about your future because they're inspired by your everyday experiences. Instead of trying to control your thoughts, allow them to wander. Finding treasures within your subconscious mind is possible when you let your imagination run wild."
pisces,2014-10-02,"You could be feeling so confident today that you staunchly defend your plans. You may believe you have to harden your position if other people are aggressive in their criticism. The thought of facing an uncertain future is scary now, but it's still better than sticking to a story that's wrong. If you realize that you've jumped to an incorrect conclusion, don't avoid the facts just because you fear the truth may be inconvenient. Honesty is your best policy, especially with yourself."
aries,2014-10-03,"It may seem as if you're at a fork in the road, but a mental fog is making it nearly impossible to see the obstacles ahead. Luckily, you have a network of smart people in your life that are able to give you much-needed guidance. But you could place so much trust in others that you forget you are the only one who can decide which path to follow. Listen respectfully to all the advice you receive, make your choice and don't look back."
taurus,2014-10-03,"Your imagination is running on overdrive today as you head into unfamiliar territory. Your daydreams are alluring, but your fear of being irrational prevents you from acting impulsively. Avoid further complications by making sure you are working with correct assumptions prior to moving forward. Trusting your intuition works best when logic is on your side."
gemini,2014-10-03,"You may set your sights on indulging your senses, but exercising a bit of self-restraint goes a long way today to keep you out of mischief. Nevertheless, you're still  tempted to head off in an unproductive direction before you consider the results of your actions. Just remember that you are probably seeing the future as you wish it to be, rather than how it is. Delay major decisions until tomorrow. In the meantime, play out your fantasies in your imagination."
cancer,2014-10-03,"Deepening the emotional bond with someone you love sounds like a wonderful idea, but romance may be overly complicated today. Even if you believe you know what you're doing, everything could change once you act on your desires. You might even choose to withdraw if you're afraid of getting your feelings hurt. It's sensible to move slowly now, rather than rushing ahead, since the future looks brighter from a distance. Take a calculated risk and open your heart."
leo,2014-10-03,"Placing too much trust in a friend or partner could land you in big trouble today. It's not that someone gives you bad advice or purposefully tries to mislead you; it's just that your options sound better than they actually are. Keep in mind that your judgment might be slightly off now and that you need more time to gain a proper perspective. Eventually, the clouds will lift and your clarity will return."
virgo,2014-10-03,"Focusing on your chores may be nearly impossible today as enticing opportunities unexpectedly drop into your life. Luckily, your good fortune continues to grow over the next few days, so you don't have to respond immediately in order to capitalize on the positive energy. In fact, your patience is rewarded, so take your time before deciding your next move. Finish your previous tasks prior to starting anything new. Working with a clean slate gives you the chance to shine."
libra,2014-10-03,"You could be viewing the future through rose-colored glasses today, prompting you to miss a crucial piece of information. Your positive attitude may be more like blind optimism unless you are willing to examine the darker side of your feelings, too. Don't be afraid of self-doubt now because ironically it can lead you down a path that reveals the truth."
scorpio,2014-10-03,"Sometimes you need to passionately jump into an experience in order to feel everything fully. However, establishing healthy boundaries between your inner and outer worlds is vital to your personal development. Taking time for a personal retreat will rejuvenate your spirit. However, remember to balance fulfilling your responsibilities with honoring your desire to escape so you don't stir up resentment from those closest to you. Being true to yourself doesn't have to come at the expense of others."
sagittarius,2014-10-03,"Your inability to complete all your chores and tasks today is not your primary problem. The real dilemma arises from your assumption that you can do anything you imagine now. Unfortunately, your conclusions might be based on fantasy and not facts. Don't agree to take on one more project until you reevaluate your workload. It's better to be realistic now than to be discouraged later."
capricorn,2014-10-03,"Aspiring to lofty ambitions is admirable if it motivates you to push harder, but you may have unreasonable ideas about what you can finish today. Creating lofty goals isn't such a good idea if your destination is out of reach. Rather than setting yourself up for failure with your inflated expectations, ground your idealistic visions with pragmatic thinking so you can feel proud of your accomplishments."
aquarius,2014-10-03,"You could be overly optimistic about your ability to make everything come up roses today. Your bold confidence might lead to premature exhaustion, especially if you can't deliver on your promises. Ironically, your heightened ambitions could prevent you from enjoying life's little pleasures. Strive for objectivity as you make plans for the future. Working too hard will surely take the fun out of the exciting days ahead."
pisces,2014-10-03,"Relationship dynamics are more complicated than they appear today as delusional Neptune messes with vulnerable Venus in your 8th House of Intimacy. On the other hand, projecting your fears or worries onto others won't lead to satisfaction. Instead, rely on your strength of character to remind you that you already know the truth and can confidently proceed with whatever you must do. The most important answers come from within."
aries,2014-10-04,"Sometimes you forget how aggressive you sound when trying to make your point. You might actually believe that you're the only person who sees the whole picture clearly. Unfortunately, your unwarranted confidence may frustrate your friends and associates today. There are many paths to the truth, so don't act like yours is the only one. Thankfully, you can make substantial progress if you remember that others have the same right to their own perspectives as you have to yours."
taurus,2014-10-04,"You might not be comfortable if you have to defend your behavior against someone's criticism today. You could even try to sidestep an important issue because you're afraid of a direct confrontation. However, your avoidance of conflict is likely to only intensify it now. Instead of retreating emotionally, face your fears and share your concerns. The outcome may pleasantly surprise you. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
gemini,2014-10-04,"Your mind is racing so fast that it's challenging to grab onto any one thought for long. However, you are determined to follow through on a creative project by discussing your plans with someone you trust. Unfortunately, your conversation may take on a life of its own, leading you away from your original inspiration. Write down your ideas so you can stay on track with your message. Start by focusing on what's most important and work from there."
cancer,2014-10-04,"Attempting to express your creativity could seem like an act of frustration today. You might feel energetically blocked, which negatively impacts your productivity. However, it's not anyone else's fault if you can't finish what you start. Apply your artistic flair to your work and concentrate on completing one task at a time. Inch by inch it's a cinch; Yard by yard it's hard."
leo,2014-10-04,"You're excited about having so many opportunities knocking at your door, but a family member or close friend may already have an agenda in mind for you today. Unfortunately, attempting to get everyone to understand your point of view might only provoke more resistance. Keep in mind that everything probably seems more critical than it actually is now, so consider relinquishing a bit of control just for the sake of playing nicely with others. Compromise is your friend."
virgo,2014-10-04,"You might find that putting your plans into motion is more challenging than you previously thought. In fact, it makes sense to ease up and let things move at their own pace for a day or two as you adjust to trickster Mercury's backward turn. Even if you aren't in the mood to negotiate today, your uncharacteristic aggression can create more problems than you want. Calm your energy and think through your next steps before swinging into action. Fine-tuning your strategy always pays off if you use your extra time wisely."
libra,2014-10-04,"You want to be as fair as possible about a decision you must make today as your actions impact others. Heightened tensions could precipitate an emotional meltdown, especially if someone is trying to coerce you into playing favorites. You prefer to work out your disagreements in a peaceful manner, but standing up for your convictions can be exactly what's needed to settle things once and for all. There's a fine line between accommodating others and losing yourself."
scorpio,2014-10-04,"You might attempt to express your true feelings without caring about the consequences. Relationships are already complex enough these days, so think twice before saying something that only complicates things further. Find a way to let everyone know what's on your mind without being attached to the outcome of the discussion. You can't control the reactions of others, but you are responsible for your own."
sagittarius,2014-10-04,"Your friends won't likely be a source of solace today because they could disagree with you on a very fundamental issue, making it nearly impossible to feel at ease in their presence. You won't be quick to let down your guard once you become aware of the gulf between you and others. Instead of falling into the trap of thinking everyone else must be wrong now, create a larger philosophical framework that can simultaneously hold many divergent opinions. Building mutual respect leads to creating common ground."
capricorn,2014-10-04,"You may be ambivalent about assuming authority on a project today because you're not sure about the most efficient way to reach your objective. Unfortunately, it might ultimately require more effort to say no than to just do what's being asked of you. You stand to better your status at home or work by demonstrating your competence, so reconsider your options carefully before selecting your route to success. Following your common sense makes you a natural leader of the pack."
aquarius,2014-10-04,"Your unconventional approach to life often has you rationalizing your most eccentric ideas. However, today you might feel overly secretive about your thinking process. Someone may accuse you of being evasive, but that's just because you haven't disclosed what's motivating your decisions. Although your intuition could be steering you in the right direction, others won't understand your intentions no matter what you say now. Letting your unexpressed thoughts simmer for a day or two isn't a bad idea if you want to be left to your own devices."
pisces,2014-10-04,"You want to get to the bottom of an unsolved mystery, yet it may be impossible to put all the facts into one coherent story now. Even if you reveal what you already know, your allies might not be very receptive while Pluto, in your 11th House of Friends, squares the Sun in your 8th House of Deep Sharing. If you end up engaging in an escalating conflict today, quietly back away from the situation with a smile. You can rekindle the discussion once everyone's emotions settle down and your clarity returns."
aries,2014-10-05,"It's not an easy feat to fulfill your need for independence in a relationship while also wanting to be fully present for someone special. Usually, these desires seem mutually exclusive, but you believe you can do both today. Unfortunately, your partner may have an entirely different set of expectations. A misunderstanding complicates things quickly, so take time to clarify exactly what you want. Reaching a solid understanding of each other's perspectives is the safest way to deepen the connection in spite of your conflicting views."
taurus,2014-10-05,"Naturally, you want to please a good friend or a lover, but you could easily go overboard today and do too much. It isn't your job to solve everyone else's problems. Offer your shoulder to lean on, listen attentively and then share your thoughts only if asked. Maintaining your own emotional balance is the best thing you can do now for those you love."
gemini,2014-10-05,You might envision yourself as a fantastic super-hero who can rescue the day by helping your allies escape boredom and experience excitement. Warrior Mars in adventurous Sagittarius aligns with brilliant Uranus in your 11th House of Social Networking. Forget about impressing others with your reality-defying moves; just enjoy the fact that you are a valuable member of the pack. You don't have to pull a rabbit out of the hat when love will do the trick.
cancer,2014-10-05,"You're eager to add a bit of spice into your daily routine, yet you don't want to stir up too much trouble. You're not interested in anonymity today; you prefer to be acknowledged for your contribution to your family or community. On the other hand, you don't want to hog the spotlight either. Ultimately, you're happiest if you don't worry about how others might judge you. It's healthier to live in the present moment so you're able to react quickly, regardless of what anyone else thinks."
leo,2014-10-05,"The drama in your love life can escalate today, but it's more of a fun distraction than a bothersome problem. You're not shy about letting others know exactly how you feel. You might be so sure of your direction that you blast ahead without forethought. Slow down  before it's too late. Adding a short time delay to your responses improves your chances of making the best decision the first time around."
virgo,2014-10-05,"Your emotions could drive you to make a spur-of-the-moment choice today, but ironically others may not be aware of your mistake. You might not be able to prevent your feelings from bouncing around all over the place, but you can get away with unconventional behavior without negative judgment now. Even if you're not sure of your actions, it's still better to trust your instincts. You are the master of your destiny so follow your heart before it's too late."
libra,2014-10-05,"The awkward tension between you and others continues to grow over the next several days. However, you still hope to establish an emotional connection with someone special if given the chance. Your desires are so strong now that you won't likely find complete satisfaction for a while. Relaxing is probably out of the question today, but with a little extra effort on your part you can express your individuality without upsetting the apple cart."
scorpio,2014-10-05,"You wake up so excited today that you want to jump right out of your skin. Although calming your nerves is tricky business now, you can successfully channel your energy into your work. Avoid the trap of being so busy that you skip around from job to job without finishing anything you start. Making many small adjustments throughout the day eases your anxiety, but doesn't solve the deeper problem. Luckily, putting your excess energy into a healthy physical outlet takes the edge off and helps you to focus on reaching your goals."
sagittarius,2014-10-05,"You may be sitting on the edge of your seat today, so enthralled with what's in front of you that you forget to follow through on your previous promises. You're tempted to run off and chase the possibility of a good time, but you might have to pay the price later if you choose to ignore your commitments. The good news is that you can respond by saying not yet instead of yes when invited out to play. Creatively juggling your schedule allows you to fit more into your day."
capricorn,2014-10-05,"You're yearning for a bit of passion in your life and are tempted to do something entirely out of character. Unfortunately, you might become so obsessive about having a good time that you end up creating more mischief than you bargained for today. Fortunately, whatever instability that surfaces now helps to release hidden feelings and reveal buried treasure. Don't hold back; any movement is better than none at all."
aquarius,2014-10-05,"The current cosmic energy generates dynamic interactions all around you. Although social distractions are compelling now, they also might prevent you from getting some  much-needed rest and relaxation. Don't work yourself up into a state of panic if time begins to slip away before you can enjoy the day. Instead, remain as flexible as possible with your schedule. It takes much more effort to fight the tide than to simply flow with it."
pisces,2014-10-05,"You want to share your plans with your closest friends today, yet you could be more interested in shocking them with your outrageous ideas than in gaining their support. To say the least, your actions can be surprising, but somehow you seem to be able to get away with more than usual now. Although you're insistent to do things your own way, your approach is novel enough that everyone is more intrigued than upset. Following your creative whims is a wonderful idea as long as you don't go so far that you can't find your way back."
aries,2014-10-06,"You may be so quiet today that others wonder if you're okay. The Moon is occupying your 12th House of Privacy, but you have current obligations that prevent you from disappearing from view. You're not obliged to explain your emotional retreat, but at least let someone know when you plan on returning. Meeting your responsibilities and keeping others in the loop can give you a chance to escape with a clear conscience."
taurus,2014-10-06,"Your ambivalence about your work won't likely be resolved today, even if coworkers rally to your cause. It's not that you don't care; to the contrary, you might care too much. Practicing emotional detachment helps take the pressure off and allows you to make a choice without fear of the consequences. Remember, the outcome is not as significant now as the process. A simple change of attitude could do you a world of good."
gemini,2014-10-06,"You might be inspired to take care of everyone's needs at work today, but this isn't a sound strategy if it distracts you from fulfilling your real responsibilities. You must establish clear boundaries now or the quixotic Pisces Moon could trick you into losing yourself in other people's problems. The good you do for someone else may ultimately be wasted if you let your own life fall apart. Fortunately, scheduling your time carefully enables you to help others while remaining true to yourself."
cancer,2014-10-06,"Your dreams of adventure can take on a life of their own today as the evocative Moon brightens your 9th House of Faraway Places. However, the willful Sun's presence in your 4th House of Security reminds you of all the reasons to stay home. Thankfully, there is a healthy middle ground between these two extremes. Don't be afraid to spread your wings and fly, but not so high that you put yourself in danger."
leo,2014-10-06,"Surrendering rational control and trusting your intuition today empowers you to negotiate an agreement with a business partner or find common ground with an adversary. Although logic won't necessarily lead to your best strategy now, clear communication is necessary in order to get others to understand your position. Don't expect anyone to know what you want by reading your mind. It's up to you to take the initiative and state your desires in a clear and succinct manner. No risk, no reward."
virgo,2014-10-06,Even your best efforts at communication could lead to confusion if you assume that you know what the other person is saying before the words are actually spoken. The emotional Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Partnerships increases your need to interact with others today. But don't jump to conclusions or you might have to untangle the knots created by an unnecessary misunderstanding. Listen with your heart but respond with your head.
libra,2014-10-06,"Sometimes other people think you're wishy-washy because your keen ability to objectively see both sides of an issue makes it tough to choose one over the other. However, you are capable of drawing your own conclusions based upon the information at your disposal today. What you lack in detail now you can make up in your imagination, and luckily, your creativity just might save the day."
scorpio,2014-10-06,"Issues of trust may rise to the surface over the next couple of days as lightning-like Uranus opposes the Sun in your 12th House of Secrets. Instinctively, you know the unvarnished truth even if others don't. However, caution is advised now because your fears could feed into any existing negativity until it's strong enough to be the main character in a story that's not grounded in fact. Once you put your fantasies in proper perspective, you can act with confidence as you strike out on your own."
sagittarius,2014-10-06,"You may start off the day with high expectations, but it quickly becomes apparent that there are issues needing to be addressed. You might believe that everything will work out on its own now that the dreamy Pisces Moon is moving through your 4th House of Domestic Conditions. However, it's nearly impossible to relax at home unless you have an open discussion with everyone involved. Simply sharing your concerns lessens the burden, but keeping communication channels open will create a more harmonious atmosphere."
capricorn,2014-10-06,"Your current fair-minded approach to getting ahead professionally should not be mistaken for a lack of concern. In fact, your easygoing style today can smoothly disarm a possible adversary who doesn't realize that you need to be taken very seriously. Thankfully, there's no reason to be overly ambitious now because it's better to cultivate supporters than enemies. Ultimately, cooperation is a smarter strategy than competition if you don't want to go it alone."
aquarius,2014-10-06,"You might not be able to see your overall financial picture clearly enough today to make an important decision. Still, you are weighing and balancing your alternatives and attempting to remain objective in the choices you make. But don't try to convince others that your current options are the best ones because the more you say the less sensible you sound. Wait a day or two before bringing anyone else into the equation. In the meantime, continue to gather facts and explore the various alternatives in front of you."
pisces,2014-10-06,"You may appear to be less certain today than you actually are because the moody Moon is hanging out in your 1st House of Self. Your emotions are closer to the surface now and others know what you're feeling even before you say a word. Instead of withdrawing, fearful that your sensitivity can make you more vulnerable, use this time to share what's in your heart with someone you trust. Having your feelings validated could be all you need to restore your confidence."
aries,2014-10-07,"You might believe you're communicating your needs clearly today, but you could be unintentionally sending mixed signals. To complicate matters further, a partner may run hot and cold, leaving you unsure about where you stand. Ultimately, the dynamic energy is exciting if you can let go of control now, since pushing your agenda on anyone else is a sure invitation to trouble. However, the relationship dance will continue to evolve if you don't try to restrict the movement. Drop your expectations and follow your heart."
taurus,2014-10-07,"Your emotions may be overwhelming today, prompting you to socially withdraw so you can sort out your feelings on your own. However, if previously scheduled activities require you to be around others more than you wish, you might lose your temper and say things you quickly regret. Keep your sharp tongue in check or you could undermine a stable relationship. Your key word for the day is cooperation. All for one and one for all."
gemini,2014-10-07,"Your individual needs clash with your social responsibilities today. Unfortunately, you might believe that you have to sacrifice one for the other, but this isn't necessarily true. Although you're traversing tricky relationship territory now, the key to your success is in finding balance -- even if you must settle for less than you want. As always, honesty works best if you combine telling the truth with kindness."
cancer,2014-10-07,"You know exactly how strong you want to appear to others today, but it may be tough to carry out your plan if your feelings get in the way. You might believe that taking a stand to establish your boundaries is essential, but direct confrontation won't bring you the happiness you seek now. Be as flexible as possible instead of working with a fixed agenda. Allowing for the element of surprise can turn a tense situation into a thrilling ride."
leo,2014-10-07,"You thought everything was progressing according to your plan, but you may need to reconsider your strategy today. You realize that your old road has come to an abrupt end. Something is about to sweep you away in an entirely new direction, but it's tough to make big decisions while you're under so much pressure. Don't focus on the uncertainty; take definitive action, even if you think that you might change your mind again tomorrow."
virgo,2014-10-07,"The evocative Moon returns to impulsive Aries today, triggering an emotional eruption before you can escape. Keeping your feelings to yourself is your modus operandi but you could suddenly lose patience and think you must make your move right this moment. Initiating action is all too easy now, but you won't be able to simply hit the undo button tomorrow."
libra,2014-10-07,"Your skills as a diplomat are being tested today and, surprisingly, you might fall short of other people's expectations. The Sun is visiting your gracious sign, yet its opposition to shocking Uranus releases buried emotions and you might find yourself in the midst of an unexpected storm. Ironically, you're uncharacteristically willing to take a big risk now. Nevertheless, it's wise to avoid dramatic confrontations and see where the energy goes before making any drastic moves."
scorpio,2014-10-07,"You might feel an urge to flirt with someone special today. Unfortunately, you're playing with fire as revolutionary Uranus inspires you to throw caution to the wind. Areas of your life that felt safe and secure just yesterday are suddenly chaotic and vulnerable now. Fortunately, you have a motivational message that could have a positive effect on others. Stand strong in your convictions, maintain your integrity and choose your words carefully."
sagittarius,2014-10-07,"It's tempting to claim that everything is copacetic, but relationship dynamics may actually be rather stressful now. However, the intensity of your defensive posture could be a clue that you're avoiding something significant. A surprising event acts as a powerful catalyst that initiates a chain reaction today, releasing suppressed emotions. You have a rare opportunity to break out of an old pattern if you have the courage to be vulnerable. Believe it or not, it's a sign of strength when you can admit that you don't have all the answers."
capricorn,2014-10-07,"You are plotting to rebel against doing things the same old way at work today as unruly Uranus opposes the Sun in your 10th House of Career. However, you can muster up some of your legendary self-restraint and resist the urge to turn your life upside down.  Thankfully, a simple twist of fate might suddenly have you singing a whole new song if you remain open to seeing all the amazing possibilities in front of you. Positive change occurs whether you initiate it or not."
aquarius,2014-10-07,"Your behavior reveals how comfortable you are with radical change as the radiant Sun illuminates your key planet Uranus today. Remember, you don't need to let every single person know exactly how you feel. However, there is no need to hesitate before sharing your ideas with someone you trust. Paying attention to other people's reactions enables you to manage this rather chaotic day with a healthy perspective and a wicked sense of humor."
pisces,2014-10-07,"Someone may push you too far today by criticizing your core values, but you could be the one who ends up in trouble if you respond with equal intensity. Although you might think you're capable of handling nearly anything that surfaces, caution is advised now. You can have the absolute best of intentions and still step on someone's toes. Respect other people's limits or you'll end up wasting a lot of time and energy pleading your case in vain. You don't have to prove how awesome you are to anyone else."
aries,2014-10-08,"You could burn one too many bridges today, but containing your feelings isn't feasible with the Aries Full Moon Eclipse activating your 1st House of Self. It may feel as if someone is exerting control over you and blocking your progress. Although your initial reaction is to just come on stronger and steamroll your way over anyone else's objections, you could misjudge the severity of the situation. Don't waste energy creating more conflict; take the high road and seek common ground instead."
taurus,2014-10-08,"Job-related responsibilities are stacking up everywhere you turn today and you might just want to run and hide. But the Aries Full Moon Eclipse polarizes your 12th House of Escape, shocking you with a few surprises along the way today. Burying your head in the sand doesn't help in the long run and it won't likely alleviate the pressure in the present moment, either. Instead of trying to outsmart reality, embrace it. Life becomes a lot more pleasant once you see your current workload as a blessing rather than a curse."
gemini,2014-10-08,"If your enthusiastic behavior triggers an extreme reaction today, you might need to make an apology, pull back on the reins and reconsider your next move before you make matters worse. The Aries Full Moon Eclipse falls in your 11th House of Social Networks, intertwining your dreams with those of others. Don't charge off on your own just to avoid the consequences of your actions. Take a deep breath and check in with those you trust; regrouping before you push forward again increases your chances of success."
cancer,2014-10-08,"Domestic obligations prevent you from rushing into a new project at work as the  Aries Full Moon Eclipse emphasizes your 10th House of Career. You're uncharacteristically eager to embark on a new professional path, but it helps to gain support from your closest friends first. Don't ignore your family responsibilities now because your true security depends on building a strong foundation. Establishing priorities is crucial today; creating an atmosphere of emotional stability empowers you to go out and conquer the world."
leo,2014-10-08,"Your mind is taking you on a wonderful adventure today as the enterprising Aries Full Moon Eclipse fires up your 9th House of Faraway Places. Although your current visions might be grounded in reality, there are no shortcuts to get from here to there. Face the facts and realize that you still may have to manifest this dream the old-fashioned way: by creating a concrete plan, putting in the hard work and maintaining an unwavering determination to make it happen."
virgo,2014-10-08,"Although you prefer to have everything pinned down in advance, you're better off keeping your options open today. The action-oriented Aries Full Moon Eclipse highlights your 8th House of Shared Resources, encouraging you to collaborate with someone on your project in order to make the most of a current opportunity. Don't be concerned if you have to give up some control over the direction of your work; what you can accomplish in partnership now will outshine what you could have done on your own."
libra,2014-10-08,"Setting aside your personal agenda and joining forces with someone else today isn't as simple as it seems. You naturally love to support your friends, but you have your own ambitions to pursue now and deviating from your deadlines leads to discouragement. The pioneering Aries Full Moon Eclipse lands in your 7th House of Partners, prompting you to persuade others to help you to accomplish your goals. It will be much easier to lend a hand to someone else once you are closer to reaching your dreams."
scorpio,2014-10-08,"A sudden breakthrough in your daily routine can lead you to doing your work more effectively than ever before. But the potential increase in productivity brought about by the presence of the Aries Full Moon Eclipse in your 6th House of Habits may require you to take a substantial risk now. Instead of using logic to explore every possible alternative today, run with the best idea and don't look back."
sagittarius,2014-10-08,"It's so easy to fall in love now that the ardent Aries Full Moon Eclipse is casting shadows in your 5th House of Romance. But your current zest for life goes beyond a simple attraction to someone who excites your heart. Even if you're ready to pursue a new relationship, an intriguing idea or a creative hobby, it's smart to take your time before turning your life upside down. You don't have to put everything at risk to follow your bliss."
capricorn,2014-10-08,"You're anticipating an energetic blast of something new on the home front, but you may not have the patience now to turn your plans into reality. The irrepressible Aries Full Moon Eclipse destabilizes your 4th House of Security, prompting you to tell your friends and family exactly what you want. Don't be distracted by a false sense of urgency; you're not the only one with changing needs. The current events are part of a larger process; instead of worrying about your immediate satisfaction today, widen your perspective for the benefit of all."
aquarius,2014-10-08,"You might be inclined to suddenly shake up your schedule as the unstoppable Aries Full Moon Eclipse rattles your 3rd House of Immediate Environment. But an unpremeditated change in your agenda could stir up more than just a bit of excitement today as unexpected consequences to your spontaneous behavior take on a life of their own. For now, the solution is easy: shift your awareness from what's right in front of your nose to the distant horizon."
pisces,2014-10-08,"You are brainstorming original ways to make money today as the enterprising Aries Full Moon Eclipse zaps your 2nd House of Income. However, it's key to realize that your passionate enthusiasm contributes to your belief that an idea is better than it might actually be in the stark light of reality. Before you head off on a wild goose chase, take the time to discuss your thoughts with a person who already knows the ropes; sometimes it's wise to heed the advice you are given."
aries,2014-10-09,"Although you might be offered a chance to take it easy today, nothing comes without a cost. The problem is that even if you manifest a mini-retreat, unexpressed emotions can build in intensity until you must do something about the situation. Be daring and share what's on your mind now with a close friend or coworker, but watch the tone of your delivery so you don't stir up petty disputes. Instead of wasting time in conflict, a gentler approach sets the stage for a meaningful dialogue."
taurus,2014-10-09,"Scheduling time to recharge your emotional batteries is a good idea today, especially if your work duties are overwhelming. Avoid the trap of believing you have to stay productive every minute of the day. Even if a melodrama unfolds nearby, there's no need to make it worse by throwing your fuel on the fire. Instead, remain calm, cool and collected now; finding pleasure in the little things rejuvenates your soul."
gemini,2014-10-09,"Clever communication comes naturally to you, but something seems quite different now. Although you maintain a certain point of view, you aren't inspired to say much about it. You might not even share anything at all. Despite the peer pressure to spill your secrets, it's crucial to trust your inner voice today, even if it still takes a while to create the positive change you seek."
cancer,2014-10-09,"You are inclined to draw a line in the sand today. If someone rubs you the wrong way, he or she might receive a lot more resistance than bargained for because you are ready to defend what is rightfully yours. Nevertheless, your real strength comes from your tenacity. Fortunately, there's no need to fight. You can hold on longer than nearly anyone else; just remember that time really is on your side."
leo,2014-10-09,"You might think that you could lose your chance to do something very exciting if you don't initiate action immediately. However, it's more likely that your current situation is progressing along nicely and it will just take longer than you wish to reach fruition. Acting impulsively today isn't your smartest move and could agitate others. Do your best to smooth over any ruffled feathers and wait for the right opportunity to ripen in its own time."
virgo,2014-10-09,"You may not be very inspired today; in fact, you might feel downright lazy. Nevertheless, keeping up with your basic routine is essential because falling behind could make the days ahead more difficult. On the other hand, it's not necessary to drive yourself harder than required. Do what you must, but reserve your energy while you can. Others might not even notice that you're giving it any less. Thankfully, conserving your resources now means they will still be available later on when you really need them."
libra,2014-10-09,"An unresolved emotional issue may stubbornly work its way to the surface today while the Moon is traveling through your 8th House of Deep Sharing. Even if you aren't comfortable expressing your feelings, at least make an effort to reach out and communicate now. Remember, you can't please everyone and you will only make yourself unhappy if you try. Anyone who is your true friend will remain one, even if you can't give them everything they want at this time."
scorpio,2014-10-09,"Your closest friends mean more to you than ever, but the obstinate Taurus Moon's presence in your 7th House of Relationships makes it tough to accept the advice from someone who is trying to help. Even if you don't agree with others now, remember that the real argument is not with them, but with an aspect of yourself. Oddly enough, once you acknowledge your own paradox, the external ones become much more manageable. Be grateful that you have people in your life who truly care about your happiness."
sagittarius,2014-10-09,"Letting go of the details is tough today, even though this approach isn't normally a problem for you. There's no reason to be too hard on yourself. Cut yourself some slack and take the time you need to get all your ducks in order. Clearing your slate now opens the way for bigger and more exciting projects to enter your life."
capricorn,2014-10-09,"You may believe that your closest friend or partner isn't giving you the support you need now, but you're cautiously optimistic about reaching your long-term goals, anyhow. However, you might grow self-protective and distance yourself emotionally from others in order to take care of business. Thankfully, you can make decisions that will be right for you in the long run as long as you keep your priorities straight and concentrate on the most immediate tasks. Once your work is finished, do whatever it takes to reconnect with those you love."
aquarius,2014-10-09,"The cosmic energies are rumbling quietly today, yet you know that there are more changes on the horizon. Accordingly, you might feel pressure to take action if you're dissatisfied with your most significant relationships. However, you don't need to force any issues today; the river of change is flowing right on schedule even if you're not aware of it. Focus on being the partner you wish you had. Real transformation occurs within you as your desire for confrontation lessens."
pisces,2014-10-09,"Your comfort level might be surprisingly high today, even if stress fades in and out all day. Although you have pressing responsibilities at work, it's still healthy to set aside some personal time for your own adventures. Relationship dynamics will likely grow more confusing in the days ahead, requiring extra effort to straighten things out. Creating your own sacred space helps you balance your worldly obligations with your spiritual needs."
aries,2014-10-10,"It's time to take a project you already started and give it a lasting structure. However, if you can't add stability to your previous venture, it might quickly fade into the past. You can influence the outcome by where you place your attention. If you do nothing now, your recent efforts could be wasted. However, if you focus on creating maximum impact, you will likely be well on your way to success."
taurus,2014-10-10,"You might feel as if crucial information has been kept from you, but now something that was previously hidden may find its way to the surface. New information is adding depth to your changing perspective, bringing you a clearer picture of your opportunities at work. But it's essential to balance your optimism with a dose of reality. Let your heart's desire lead you gently into your future but don't forget to take your common sense along for the ride."
gemini,2014-10-10,"Although you assume your motives are completely transparent, others might have no idea what you are up to now. However, their lack of clarity may have very little to do with your behavior. Try to be as forthright as possible; your honesty will be appreciated even if your desires and expectations don't conform to those around you. Respect everyone, but to thine own self be true."
cancer,2014-10-10,"Your friends are your source of stability today. However, there is still a bit of fog between you and reality, challenging you to watch your step so you stay on track. As long as you keep your goals simple, you can rely on your intuition to guide your way. Attempting to carry out several tasks at once might leave you floating around in the space of your own dreams. Eliminating unnecessary distractions enables you to smoothly sail along to your destination."
leo,2014-10-10,"Previous attempts to learn something new may have led to  frustration. Now it's time to give it another shot, whether your education is experiential or academic. Travel is still on your agenda, either in the physical realms or within your mind. However, you can benefit from applying your big ideas toward more sensible career goals. Integrate your desires with a dash of practicality and you can't go wrong."
virgo,2014-10-10,"Putting your feet solidly back on solid ground today is the first step to reestablishing stability. However, the recent intensity of your emotions lingers for a while longer, but now your confidence returns and you know exactly what to do. Don't take your eyes off the goal; you can be successful at your endeavors as long as you keep your optimism alive."
libra,2014-10-10,"Something in the air has changed and you are suddenly ready to dig into an issue that you might have been avoiding until now. The solution to your problem, though, is no longer as simple as it once was. Your best weapon in this current engagement with reality is your willingness to cooperate. Your chances for success are high if you focus on working for the betterment of everyone involved. Setting a worthy example inspires others to jump in and do their part."
scorpio,2014-10-10,"You have grown weary of the daily grind and now seek the simplicity of retreat. However, trying a conservative strategy isn't about traveling back in time; it's about moving into a less complicated future. Instead of struggling to escape, put your energy toward fulfilling your obligations. Find new ways to finish your chores and you'll have your opportunity to relax before you know it."
sagittarius,2014-10-10,"Fun and games are knocking at your door but you can't decide whether or not to let them in. There is a low-level angst building internally, reminding you that you have unfinished work to do today. You cannot sidestep what's on your plate now, so sort out your priorities and deal with your responsibilities in a methodical manner. Once your conscience is clear, you can live more joyfully in the moment."
capricorn,2014-10-10,The weight on your shoulders is lighter today because of the progress you are making on more enjoyable aspects of your life. It's finally time to reap the benefits of your recent hard work and take some well-deserved time off. There's no reason to justify your actions; pursuing pleasure is your reward for a job well done.
aquarius,2014-10-10,"You might try to ignore issues on the home front, but the sooner you face your feelings, the better it will be for everyone involved. Maintaining a warm and loving attitude helps the situation, even if someone makes you angry at first. However, fueling hostilities won't solve anything; slipping into denial only makes matters worse. Gentle kindness and a steady hand mean more today than the smug satisfaction of being right."
pisces,2014-10-10,"The light of awareness shines with great clarity on relationship matters today, empowering you to make sound choices. Don't be afraid of trusting your intuition even if you are worried about a significant decision currently on the table. Leaning on your core values leads to a solid emotional investment. Do what you know is right; although your current actions might not have an immediate effect, their long-term impact will be profound."
aries,2014-10-11,"You are insistent to win the approval of others today by wearing them down with your charming and innovative style. Unfortunately, you are relentless in your approach and might not know when to call it quits. You can still carry on a passionate discussion within your own head. It's fantastic if you learn something about your feelings in the process. But if you're not ready for the reality of a relationship now, then it's wiser to simply be honest and move on."
taurus,2014-10-11,"It's as if you are swimming against a great tide and it's nearly impossible to think logically today when your key planet Venus opposes rebellious Uranus. Whether you give skydiving a whirl, try your hand at speed-dating or eat at a new restaurant, you might as well set aside your responsibilities now and do something that's out of the box. If expressing your desires doesn't hurt anyone else and could increase your happiness, then push past your comfort zone and follow your bliss."
gemini,2014-10-11,"You are waging an inner war between two extremes today. You long for more action, yet may already have so much going on that your excitement can turn to a palpable anxiety. Meanwhile, even a minor attempt to find some peace and quiet could work so well that you are left feeling isolated in your seclusion. However, there's no need to choose between these opposite worlds now. You Gemini are the champions of duality so hold these divergent perspectives until the tension begins to settle down."
cancer,2014-10-11,"You wish you could distance yourself from your intense feelings today. Although your immediate reaction to emotional stress is not your typical one, you feel more comfortable now if you step back from the drama of a relationship. You might prefer to lose yourself into the vastness of the virtual landscape where you can stay in touch with your changing moods while maintaining anonymity. However, if you start to obsess over your digital distractions, unplug from your electronics and connect with people in the real world instead."
leo,2014-10-11,"You may have unrealistic visions about your future yet still believe you can manifest them through sheer willpower. You might feel trapped by your previous commitments, and your impatience could fuel an impulsive reaction today. You crave a chance to make something exciting happen -- and you want it now. However, your heightened sense of urgency does not help your cause; you're more likely to reach your goals if you balance your anticipation with a dose of pragmatism and stop looking for trouble."
virgo,2014-10-11,"A friend or associate might turn your day inside out when he or she behaves in an erratic manner. But you may react too quickly and judge someone before you even stop and think about it. But playing the role of an authority figure isn't useful, for this could push away the very person you're trying to befriend. Paradoxically, encouraging someone else to dance to the sound of their own drum ultimately brings them closer to you."
libra,2014-10-11,"Your eagerness to experiment encourages you to test the waters now by interacting with someone who is completely different from anyone else in your life. Shocking Uranus electrifies your key planet Venus today, attracting unusual people, places and things like a magnet collects iron. It's not the time to listen to what everyone else is saying; just follow your heart wherever it leads and deal with the fallout of your actions as necessary."
scorpio,2014-10-11,"Someone who seems to be acting in a manipulative manner today could stir up feelings of apprehension. But you really don't want to get too close to others at this time. However, the strong attraction to a totally new experience stimulates your curiosity, making it difficult for you to turn away. Don't succumb to your fears by retreating; remaining in the zone of discomfort can lead to a powerful emotional breakthrough."
sagittarius,2014-10-11,"You might find yourself dreaming today about the greener grass on the other side of the hill even if you're in a mutually satisfying relationship. Given the opportunity, you most likely would choose excitement over security now. However, it may be best to leave some desires unexplored. Finding less disruptive ways to widen your current horizons is healthier than going to extremes in your quest for transient pleasure."
capricorn,2014-10-11,"You may have complicated issues at home to handle that end up getting in the way of more ambitious plans. Perhaps you thought that others would support your ideas, but something doesn't go as expected today. Nevertheless, don't worry too much about your previous strategy, for it can be changed in a moment's notice by someone's surprising reaction. Instead, willingly leap into the great unknown. Dancing with uncertainty now keeps you humble and on your toes."
aquarius,2014-10-11,"You can be quite cavalier in your thinking now that cerebral Mercury is backpedaling in your 9th House of Adventure. But it's a real challenge to follow through on your plans if you're not sure about your destination. People's attitudes are transforming, forcing you to alter your own course of action. The more accommodating you are today, the better you'll feel tomorrow when you reestablish your direction."
pisces,2014-10-11,"You might make a significant conceptual breakthrough today that turns your life around and inspires you to come up with a whole new strategy for your future. The idea of a sudden shift may be quite exhilarating now, but keep in mind that you cannot just forget about your previous responsibilities. Reconnecting with someone you trust is not about revisiting the past; it's about jointly envisioning your path ahead. Nevertheless, you still must balance your expectations with your recent commitments to get the most from the present moment."
aries,2014-10-12,"Everyone else seems to have answers for your questions today, but you aren't convinced that any of them make sense. Your window of opportunity won't last forever, so don't put off your decision for too long. Unfortunately, your confidence can steer you wrong if you think that adding more alternatives now is your best bet. Instead of seeking more choices, just pick the most practical one available and don't look back."
taurus,2014-10-12,"Adopting a simplistic approach goes a long way toward raising your spirits today, especially if you feel overwhelmed by the recent pressures of everyday life. But don't get too agitated about finishing your work before you know all the facts. Taking a project to the next level may require additional research now, but the key to your current happiness is likely buried in the details. Ultimately, knowledge is power."
gemini,2014-10-12,"You are inspired to swing into action as the Moon's visit to your restless sign lights a fire under you. But running into a small obstacle could be enough to quickly change your mind. You're not easily discouraged, but your attention span is even shorter than usual now. Sticking to your agenda when expressing your feelings is a challenge today, yet your vigilance might make a big difference. Bringing your focus back to your original point of view enables your creativity to come to the rescue and save the day."
cancer,2014-10-12,"Your dreams overflow into daylight hours, making it difficult to separate facts from fantasy. Thankfully, the Moon brightens your 12th House of Inner Peace today, empowering you to draw great inspiration from your imagination. Don't try to suppress any flights of fancy. Unfettered thoughts are like kites today; let them soar freely, but don't forget that you are holding the cord that tethers them to reality. You decide when to bring your ideas back down to earth."
leo,2014-10-12,"You can't help but feel enthusiastic about your future as the Moon shines in your 11th House of Goals; unfortunately, it's impossible to tell if your optimism is warranted. A romance may appear quite real now, like a carrot dangling on a stick in front of you. However, the original source of your motivation isn't as important as you think. Maintain your integrity at all costs; your decisions will be sound as long as your actions remain consistent with your values."
virgo,2014-10-12,"You might be so enamored with what you're learning today that you continue to collect all the relevant details that you can find. Maintaining your confidence requires extra effort, especially if you attempt to prove your point by overwhelming others with information. Forget about trying to discern what's right; following your instincts now sets you on the path to success."
libra,2014-10-12,"It's helpful to keep your hopes in check today so you don't set yourself up for disappointment. Thankfully, you can apply your creative imagination to transform a really good relationship into an even better one. However, it isn't wise to take anything for granted now or your dreams might just slip away. Keep your feet on the ground and make a sincere effort if you want to connect with others on a deeper level. Opening your heart is a true act of courage."
scorpio,2014-10-12,"You may be rather uncertain about your career objectives now that messenger Mercury has stepped backed into your 12th House of Invisibility. However, you're not particularly interested in lingering on the fantasies that are tempting you to pursue different life paths. New possibilities appear on the horizon today, yet changing your direction might be risky. Instead of attempting to plan for the unknown, concentrate on the present moment so you can build upon your accomplishments one step at a time."
sagittarius,2014-10-12,You want to be completely objective when considering your alternatives today. It doesn't matter if you already have a destination in mind and a plan to get there; people can still throw you off course with all their wild and crazy ideas anyhow. You might discover that your goals are not as set in stone as you thought. But don't give up on your original agenda; it may be more relevant than you think. Entertain all possibilities for a while longer before narrowing your field of options.
capricorn,2014-10-12,"You might be feeling a bit disoriented today, challenging you to find your balance. Your natural tendency is to make a concrete plan and gather your resources prior to performing each chore with great deliberation. Unfortunately, this sensible strategy may lead you to fall short of your goals anyhow. Although it sounds counterintuitive, you can increase your efficiency now if you stop thinking and begin doing. It doesn't matter if you experience a false start or two; if at first you don't succeed, try, try again."
aquarius,2014-10-12,"Although the circumstances of the day might not unfold according to your plan, there's no point in obsessing on getting things back on track. Instead of pushing against the grain, relax the reins of control. However, don't squander a rare opportunity to use this time to reconsider your desires and reevaluate what's most important to your heart."
pisces,2014-10-12,"Your current career goals may be overwhelmed by your growing desire to stretch beyond your old limits. However, you might feel as if your energy level is low and worry that you won't be able to finish your work within your time constraints. Unfortunately, you could fret so much that your productivity suffers. There's no reason to judge yourself so harshly; you can gain a clearer picture of what is going on in your world if you separate your expectations from your emotions. Don't be afraid to spread your wings and fly."
aries,2014-10-13,"You might be overly impressed by your own quick wit today, but others may not be so amused with your sharp tongue. Although you often express what's on your mind in the moment, you could choose to keep more to yourself as the day wears on. Nevertheless, there's no need to withdraw completely; just be discerning when making decisions about your communication throughout the day. If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all."
taurus,2014-10-13,"Although you long for the comfort of spending time with your friends, you might not let them into your heart today. Your emotions can grow so strong that you feel the need to protect yourself against being too vulnerable. Hiding behind a lot of clever words or confusing actions can keep others guessing about your real intentions. Conserve your energy; there's no need to engage in any diversionary activities. Being authentic with those you trust is more useful than playing games."
gemini,2014-10-13,"It's nearly impossible to keep your feelings in check today as you try to catch up to the changes all around you. You probably don't mind the temporary loss of control because all the uncertainty makes you feel vibrantly alive. Acknowledging your needs should be a top priority; if you are in alignment with your inner self, you will be able to be as productive as you wish."
cancer,2014-10-13,"Your perfect fantasy might be about withdrawing from the outer world since the Moon is still hiding out in your 12th House of Privacy. However, you don't really want to be alone for long; the Moon's shift into your sign this evening increases your desire to share your feelings with a special friend. However, your personal disclosure may not go as expected, so be prepared for surprises ahead. Your flexibility will allow you to roll with the changes and land on your feet."
leo,2014-10-13,"If you feel slighted by someone's inconsiderate actions today, you might choose to sulk about it rather than getting it off your chest. Withholding your emotions can initiate an important process now as you learn a lot about your personal goals by comparing what you have with what you want. Nothing is gained by being angry with yourself for not speaking your truth. Have faith that you will say what's on your mind when the time is right."
virgo,2014-10-13,"You could receive opportune assistance at work today, but you must remain open to expanding your horizons. Help arrives in a most unusual manner and might catch you slightly off guard. However, you won't get far if you only rely on your analytical abilities. Let your thoughts roam the edges of your imagination, and then respond accordingly after you have a chance to develop a more concrete plan. Blending magic into your day-to-day process brings you the best of both worlds."
libra,2014-10-13,"You are in a rather optimistic frame of mind today as you try to see the spiritual side of every new idea that rises into your awareness. Unfortunately, staying grounded becomes trickier as the day unfolds. There are so many opportunities knocking on your door that you might be hard-pressed to respond. Take a deep breath and relax; luckily, you have more time than you realize to decide your next move."
scorpio,2014-10-13,"You might spend much of the day lost in your fantasies, conjuring up a perfect vacation retreat. In fact, you may be having so much fun planning your itinerary that you struggle to concentrate on the mundane tasks before you. The more you try to focus today, the more your mind wanders. However, if you allow yourself the luxury of daydreaming, there are no limits to the power of your imagination now. Whatever you envision can manifest if you remember to live up to your responsibilities in the real world, too."
sagittarius,2014-10-13,"You could become uncomfortable today if your feelings are drawn into a deep and magical place. You naturally prefer exploring the real world, but your current attractions are found in the emotional and metaphysical realms. Don't resist taking a contemplative path for a while; this spiritual journey can enrich your life if you just let go and see where it takes you. Believe it or not, the greatest adventure may lie within."
capricorn,2014-10-13,"Your mind is running a mile a minute today, making it tough to focus on one specific task. But later in the day the Moon slips into hypersensitive Cancer and your 7th House of Partnerships, inviting you to embark on a highly emotional journey. However, you could fall into the trap of believing feelings are obstacles that prevent you from completing whatever work needs to be done. Push through this faulty reasoning; what seems like a burden now can morph into a gift when you accept what others share with you at face value."
aquarius,2014-10-13,"Although you might have to start the day by tending to unfinished chores, you don't need to feel restrained by your responsibilities. Thankfully, you're free to explore the more artistic side of your character once your obligations are met. Don't intellectualize your intuitive experience; just jump in without restraint. Your weirdest thoughts and desires have the potential of becoming fuel for your creative process if you get out of the way of your imagination."
pisces,2014-10-13,"Relying on your instincts can increase the stability in your life while simultaneously deepening your connection with the future. Intuitively feel  your way down the road, without being concerned with too many facts and figures. Even if you choose to keep your inspirational visions to yourself today, at least make sure to record them for future reference. As William Blake wrote, ""What is now proved was once only imagined."""
aries,2014-10-14,"Anything that can go right for you today, will. But you still may have some resistance on your part, for you believe that you shouldn't receive the goodies without putting in the effort. Although you could be coasting and soaking up the recognition, you might feel the need to work like a busy bee now anyway. There's no harm in being ambitious as long as you remember to step back and enjoy the fruits of your labor when you get the chance."
taurus,2014-10-14,"Your desires are irrepressible today and it seems that fulfillment is within easy reach. Common sense is likely playing second fiddle to pleasure now, setting the tone for your current activities. It is nearly impossible for anyone to talk you out of your search for fun now. Carpe diem; indulge in a delicious bit of guilt-free time off before returning to your regularly scheduled routine."
gemini,2014-10-14,"You're like a lucky leprechaun with a charmed day on your hands -- and you don't even need to wave your magic wand to find your pot of gold. Wonderful things might just come your way now without much effort on your part. Postpone non-essential chores until tomorrow so you can make the most of the positive cosmic energy today. Thankfully, others might not even notice your absence, allowing you to get away with your little escape to the end of the rainbow."
cancer,2014-10-14,"Emotional extravagance isn't normally your style, but you might just find yourself stepping beyond your limits today. Your need for adventure is reaching new heights and your confidence soars even if you secretly think you should be more careful. But your current behavior is not solely under the influence of logic. Taking a risk now is an intelligent plan if you simply follow your heart."
leo,2014-10-14,"It may be an exercise in futility for people to try to contain your energy today, and you're certainly not going to restrain yourself. Your adrenaline is pumping, your heart is racing and you're not going to stop until you get what you want. The funny thing is you have an excellent chance of scoring the love, money, or appreciation that you want. Satisfaction can be yours if you don't get greedy and expect more than you deserve."
virgo,2014-10-14,"You can express your current feelings without any inhibition today. This kind of emotional expression doesn't come naturally to you, but you just may feel safe enough now in these protected emotional waters. There's nothing to fear except fear itself; jump right in while the currents are flowing your way."
libra,2014-10-14,"It doesn't matter how crazy your life is these days; somehow you still can make the sweetest lemon meringue pie out of the sourest lemons around. You are capable of manifesting the beautiful visions in your dreams if you are handed the right ingredients. And, thankfully, your current creation will likely be lauded by your peers. Don't be distracted by the vagaries of the moment; keep your eyes on the prize for the best results."
scorpio,2014-10-14,"Your current job situation may come with complications of its own, but your long-term career opportunities look promising anyhow. You should end up on top as long as you do whatever makes your heart happy. If you pursue your dreams, your self-esteem blossoms and the money will follow. Although there are still some hard things to be said, you have more time to say them than you think. Instead of stirring up unnecessary drama today, practice random acts of kindness wherever you go."
sagittarius,2014-10-14,"You see lucrative opportunities everywhere you look today. You feel loved and lucky now that Venus, the planet of beauty, is harmonizing with benevolent Jupiter, bestowing a cheerful glow onto nearly everything in your life. This is a fantastic planetary combination as long as you don't let the moment pass you by without taking decisive action. Pursuing your highest potential leads you on a journey to success."
capricorn,2014-10-14,"You have a wonderful chance to heal a relationship today, but you must proceed gently if you want to make real progress. You may be feeling more optimistic these days -- and although your positive vibes bode well for your future, you can easily overextend your energy. Although your life appears to be on the upswing, things might not be quite as awesome as they seem. If your emotions begin to run away with your logic, trust your common sense to keep you on solid ground."
aquarius,2014-10-14,"Friends or coworkers may arrive at your doorstep with an irresistible plan for fun. You immediately know you want in without giving it much thought. Any kind of social celebration sounds like what you need, but don't forget about everyone who is counting on you to deliver on your promises. It may be too easy to say yes today, even if you need to honor your previous commitments first. Thankfully, you can have your cake and eat it too, if you schedule your time wisely."
pisces,2014-10-14,Nearly everything has a tendency to smooth itself out today without you having to step in and take over. Even potential conflicts with others that appeared to be heading toward a showdown seem to fade away now. It's not that every problem disappears; it's more like the clouds part and you can remember what blue sky and sunshine feel like. Visualizing the best possible scenario lays the groundwork to your success. Color in all the details to inspire the manifestation of your dreams.
aries,2014-10-15,"Your behavior is confusing to your coworkers because you act like you know the score, but there is more going on here than meets the eye. There's tension brewing and it's not yet clear what your role is in the unfolding drama. Undoubtedly, your imagination is being tickled but your emotions are on edge; you feel restless, even rebellious today. Reality is performing a magic trick; if your attention lapses now, you could miss the action. Keep your eye on the ball and your focus on the game."
taurus,2014-10-15,"You believe you are working with tangible facts, but reality is a bit of a slippery slope now. Although you may not be clear about your place in the world or about how others judge you, you can recognize when something feels good and this is enough of a justification to pursue it. Unfortunately, your senses might be overstimulated, making it difficult to maintain good judgment. If life doesn't live up to your expectations, remember it's always better to know the truth than to perpetuate a fantasy."
gemini,2014-10-15,"Someone who is allegedly your friend may be inscrutable now, making it hard to tell who is really on your side. There are contradictory signals at work and it's tricky to navigate a course through the weird circumstances that are playing out in your life. You may become so lost that you can't figure out how to return to reality. Take your time and get your bearings before traveling too far from home. It's easier to reach your destination once you know where you are."
cancer,2014-10-15,"You may feel truly inspired today, even if people think you are a bit loony. Your senses are so acutely tuned now that you might hear mermaids singing sea chants in some unknown ancient language. And, the weird thing is that their songs make perfect sense to your ears. The waters of your subconscious are rising like a flood tide. Don't bother foolishly trying to hold back the flow. It doesn't matter what others think; you can swim with the best of them."
leo,2014-10-15,"A trusted friend may throw you a curve ball today and you won't see it coming unless you are ready. So, keep your defenses on high alert all day as it's too easy to get broadsided by the unexpected. This surprise might seem like a pleasant experience at first, encouraging you to let down your guard. Don't. Staying on your toes empowers you to react swiftly and turn a difficult situation in your favor."
virgo,2014-10-15,"You are being lured out of your comfort zone, beyond the safety that is created by your analytical mind. The practical answers that you usually have at your fingertips are just out of reach today. This lack of clarity is so unlike you that it can cause you to lose your rhythm as you go about the business of your day. However, this intellectual fuzziness does have a purpose. The fact is it's time to set aside your logical mode and rely more on your intuition. Drop the details and let the Force be with you."
libra,2014-10-15,"Most days you know what you like and you can apply your common sense towards getting it. But today your pragmatism has left the building and you are on your own. All you have to work with now is your next whim or fantasy. Let the powerful creations of your imagination roam freely. However, don't make them bigger than they are by foolishly acting on whatever your dream up. Keeping things in a healthy perspective enables you to avoid unnecessary trouble."
scorpio,2014-10-15,"You can scale the depths of your own imagination or be fascinated with someone else's, but in either case you're embarking on a confusing ride today. You're entering your own version of the Twilight Zone where it is impossible to know what is real. You're likely to leave the mundane world behind as you grow quite enamored with the fantasy realm. There is no reason to worry as you'll land back on earth soon enough, forever altered by your memory of something special."
sagittarius,2014-10-15,"Once you Centaurs decide what you want, it's not easy for anyone else to change your mind. Nevertheless, you can still talk yourself into liking nearly anything today. You are being pulled along by a tide that is greater than you. You may find yourself spellbound by something or someone only to realize within a few days that you were captivated by a figment of your own imagination. Seeing the trap in advance might be all you need to avoid getting hooked."
capricorn,2014-10-15,"You could find a voice that you didn't even know you had if you're willing to draw from your own experiences today. You might think you are speaking with clarity of vision and strength of purpose. But even if others believe that you are a force to be reckoned with, you need to exercise caution now. Don't try to mislead anyone; you will gain strong allies if they respect the integrity that you bring to the situation. Maintain your authenticity at all costs."
aquarius,2014-10-15,"You are riding a high-frequency buzz now, adding a layer of complexity to an already cosmically confusing day. Your feelings seem like they are bent out of shape and you don't quite know how to manage them. No matter what, don't hold everything inside today or you could explode like a volcano letting off steam. Muster up some old-fashioned charm, soften your hard edges and you'll pass the test without incident."
pisces,2014-10-15,"If there was ever a perfect day for a quick get-away, this might be it. There are countless ways to escape and over the next few days you could discover a few of them. If you don't take time to do something totally eccentric or wildly creative now, you may end up facing more serious consequences while looking for emergency exits later. Swim upstream, Fish, or float away in the tide. It's your choice and only you can make it."
aries,2014-10-16,"Hiding your feelings is not an option today, even if you think what you share could make someone rather uncomfortable. You're not interested in stirring up any conflict now, yet you probably won't let the possibility of discord get in your way. Say what you must, but remember to think twice before you just blurt out something that you wish you had kept to yourself. Waiting for the right moment is worth the extra effort."
taurus,2014-10-16,"You are impatient with smooth-talkers who don't follow through on what they say. You prefer to demonstrate your feelings rather than just sitting around talking about them. But your actions might be misinterpreted unless you also let others know your thoughts. Thankfully, it doesn't take much effort to avert an unnecessary conflict by explaining your motives first. Backing up your behavior with the right message is an unbeatable combination."
gemini,2014-10-16,"You are swept up in an emotional flow that weaves together separate threads of your life today. Fortunately, you don't have to prepare since the integration should come rather naturally now. Nevertheless, you can still facilitate positive change by bringing your awareness back to the present moment. Pay more attention to your inner process than to what others might think of your actions. You may be happily surprised with the results if you simply speak from your heart."
cancer,2014-10-16,"You have a lot more going on in your emotional world than you care to admit today, even if you give off the impression of being transparent. However, you can't blame anyone else if you don't get what you want unless you let others know what you need. You can choose to increase your dissatisfaction now by keeping your feelings to yourself or you can use the outgoing Leo Moon as a catalyst to share your desires with someone you love."
leo,2014-10-16,"A hectic day awaits you, yet you're ready to pack as much as you can into your busy schedule. Although you may be pulled one way and then another, it's best to handle each situation as it occurs rather than letting unresolved issues accumulate. You might be tempted to tell everyone how you feel while the evocative Moon is spotlighting your 1st House of Personality, but it's smarter now to say less and let your actions speak for you instead."
virgo,2014-10-16,"If you are looking for the best time to say what's on your mind today, weigh the alternatives and then carefully speak your piece. Although tooting your own horn isn't necessarily your style, reminding people of your accomplishments might be a strategically advantageous thing to do now. Keep in mind that others won't think any less of you if you just stand up and accept the recognition you deserve. In fact, your status may continue to grow as you rise to the occasion."
libra,2014-10-16,"You might not be clear about where you are going today, but you're still eagerly anticipating what's next. Mental Mercury lines up with the Sun in your artistic sign, shifting you out of your comfort zone as you discover ways to colorfully express your creativity. Give yourself permission to talk about what you want to do without being shy or holding back. You don't need to have all the answers; all that's required now is a clever inspiration and a can-do attitude."
scorpio,2014-10-16,"You're wearing your heart on your sleeve today, but you still may feel awkward if you can't easily express yourself in words. Although you were built to withstand emotional pressure, other people might be uncomfortable with your disclosure. Nevertheless, it isn't your job to protect everyone from your intensity. Show others how much you care while still remaining true to yourself."
sagittarius,2014-10-16,"You can't ignore the wave of desire that continues to grow, but you still might not feel ready to reveal what you want to others. You may attempt to suppress your emotions because even the thought of discussing them makes you anxious. But pretending that everything is copacetic won't bring you happiness, either. Even if you believe your confession could complicate an otherwise uncomplicated day, rest assured that expressing what you want is ultimately better than remaining silent."
capricorn,2014-10-16,"Although you must complete your chores today as promised, you're also longing for some personal downtime. Fortunately, you can get away with doing less than usual now, but your desire to impress others with your competence doesn't leave a lot of room for relaxation. Don't hold yourself to an impossibly high standard. Sometimes, it's advisable to ease off on the throttle so you can enjoy the scenery along the way."
aquarius,2014-10-16,"Even if you're not humming with romantic energy yet, you still can be incredibly creative today. Sensual Venus is very close to the Sun-Mercury conjunction in relationship-oriented Libra, suggesting that love could be in the air. Nevertheless, it is up to you to make that something special happen. You may be serious about your personal growth but you would also like to collaborate with a playful partner. Your perfect companion is someone who is funny yet can still add meaning to what you are already trying to express."
pisces,2014-10-16,"Finalizing your plans for an upcoming trip might seem like the right thing to do now, but it's more important to focus on the present. You may be gifted with an opportunity to improve a significant relationship if you're willing to reevaluate your current priorities. It's not that you can't do it all; it's just that you are easily distracted. Nevertheless, there's no need to be self-critical if your mind wanders. Just demonstrate your commitment by showing up in the present moment."
aries,2014-10-17,"You have an enticing opportunity to spend quality time with people you really like today, but you still need to finish your work before you go traipsing off with your friends. Unfortunately, they can distract you from fulfilling your promises. Thus, it is not a good idea to disrupt your regular routine today. Keep your current dissatisfaction to yourself and mind your responsibilities for now."
taurus,2014-10-17,"You know exactly what you want to accomplish at work today, yet you also must find the time to honor your personal needs as well. You could believe that any deviation from your plan indicates a lack of success, but this line of thought is far from the truth. You might be a bit emotionally disoriented now, so don't worry if the day unfolds differently than you imagined. Throw all of your preconceived notions out the window and exercise flexibility for a change."
gemini,2014-10-17,"You might feel unsettled today because your schedule doesn't leave much wiggle room for fun and games. You don't have time to let other people's troubles hijack your day. Luckily, it's entirely possible to enjoy yourself while still being emotionally responsive to those you love. Your mental versatility and quick wit enable you to offer your genuine support with just the right words. Trust your heart to tell you when you can gracefully slip away."
cancer,2014-10-17,"It's time to reconsider your relationships with close friends or business partners, especially if there are money issues involved. Your desire to iron out the details of a financial arrangement can be complicated by a lack of information or a misunderstanding. Even if you want closure today, it's wiser to leave things open-ended for now. In the meantime, discussing the various options you have will lead to finding the clarity you seek."
leo,2014-10-17,"Your intentions may be admirable today, but others might misunderstand you no matter how positive you are in your approach. The cosmic culprit is trickster Mercury hooking up with friendly Venus in your 3rd House of Communication. Perhaps people don't trust your words because your delivery is overly optimistic. Don't try to convince anyone of your altruistic motives; just maintain your position and your integrity will eventually speak for itself."
virgo,2014-10-17,"The overwhelming uncertainty of your life could undermine your confidence today. Fortunately, you are quite capable of covering your anxiety and hiding your doubts because your key planet Mercury conjuncts gracious Venus in charming Libra. The good news is whatever advantage you may lose to faulty logic now, you gain in charisma and creativity. Fake it till you make it."
libra,2014-10-17,"Ask precisely for what you want today and you just might receive it as clever Mercury conjuncts your key planet Venus, enabling you to be quite persuasive in your plea. But you may have to risk a little emotional security to be heard, since your attitude is softened by accommodating Venus in your rational sign. Be as specific as possible in your request; the more details you supply now, the better your chances are of success."
scorpio,2014-10-17,"You might misread someone's intentions today and turn an otherwise insignificant comment into a major drama. Unfortunately, your perspective is so distorted now that it's challenging to maintain clarity. Blowing things out of proportion only makes things worse. It may be more prudent to wait a day or two before you respond in order to see what happens. Treat every interaction as objectively as possible until you know how it fits into the larger picture."
sagittarius,2014-10-17,"Too many people requesting too much information from you could give you a colossal headache today. Don't just make up a story on the spot, for your colleagues will immediately catch on. Honesty is the best policy; share the plain and simple facts to the best of your knowledge and leave it at that. As long as you're being truthful, you don't have to know all the answers. Sometimes others just have to figure it out for themselves."
capricorn,2014-10-17,"Your work plans could fall apart today as you watch the details begin to unravel. Hopefully, you can see this predicament as a positive experience because you are receiving an advanced warning that your ideas need more development. Don't try to force the issue and glue everything back together. Instead, rethink your strategy before taking corrective action. Believe it or not, facing an obstacle now might be a blessing in disguise."
aquarius,2014-10-17,"Someone's overly dramatic story puts you in an awkward position today if you don't know how to respond. You want to help, but you're afraid that if you dig too deeply you might uncover details you wish you didn't know. However, if you don't investigate at all, then you won't have all the facts you need to make a big decision. Prepare for the element of surprise; when the answer finally comes, it may not be what you expect."
pisces,2014-10-17,"Be careful about placing too much trust in your instincts now because a flash of inspiration could steer you in the wrong direction. Although it's useful to recognize the amazing potential of a current situation, your mind may be playing tricks on you today. Even if you believe you're seeing the actual path ahead, check out your assumptions with a close friend or partner before doing something you might regret. Asking for another point of view never hurts, especially if you take the advice you receive to heart."
aries,2014-10-18,You are confident that others will live up to your high expectations today and are quite surprised if they fall short. Your willingness to give someone the benefit of the doubt could backfire unless you maintain objectivity when assessing the facts. Just acknowledge the limitations of available time and resources for all parties involved. Nothing is gained by blowing reality out of proportion. Bigger isn't always better; good things often come in small packages.
taurus,2014-10-18,"It's as if you're waking up from a deep sleep today. Opening your eyes empowers you to see all the possibilities in front of you, even though you might not be doing anything differently from yesterday. Although your new found enthusiasm inspires you to shake things up, it's not wise to expect too much change overnight. Give yourself a few more days to explore your options as the fog continues to lift and your clarity of vision improves."
gemini,2014-10-18,"Your environment might appear chaotic today and a variety of interruptions easily distracts you from your original plans.  Everyone may seem incredibly busy and you are eager to be swept up in the frenzy. However, you could already have more on your plate than you can handle. Prioritizing your commitments early in the day allows you to participate in the fun without being overwhelmed."
cancer,2014-10-18,"Your self-confidence is growing today, tempting you to feel invincible. The good news is this upbeat outlook positively impacts your behavior. However, an inflated sense of optimism can lead to trouble. Don't wait until you're in over your head with promises you can't keep. Strategically choosing your commitments sets the tone for success and eliminates obstacles to happiness before they even appear."
leo,2014-10-18,"You may have a bullet-proof plan for the day that includes some serious rest and relaxation. Your infectious enthusiasm can be almost enough to make everything work in your favor. However, in your haste for fun and frivolity, you might have skipped over a few details. In spite of a minor setback, a practical approach, combined with your unrelenting determination, could have you on your way before you know it."
virgo,2014-10-18,"You can't easily explain your behavior today because your actions come from your heart and not from your head. Your optimism is on the rise even if the current facts don't necessarily support such a positive picture. However, the good news is that your strong desire for change might be enough of a catalyst to get the ball rolling in the right direction. Follow the momentum; the future is much closer than you think."
libra,2014-10-18,"Ironically, taking the course of least resistance can draw you out into the spotlight today. It might happen so fast that you're caught off guard by the attention you receive. The reflective Moon is traveling through your 11th House of Future Goals, preparing you for what's on the horizon, even if you're not consciously thinking about it. There's no reason to overanalyze everything; just keep your dreams alive now so you have the potential of making them come true."
scorpio,2014-10-18,"You have all the right stuff to shine like a bright star today. The unflappable Leo Moon is highlighting your 10th House of Status, but you might not be ready to assume your new responsibilities. Nevertheless, you feel exceedingly hopeful about your future, but it still could take time before you are able to realize your dreams. Your smartest strategy now is to talk less and do more. Positive action lights the way for you and those who follow."
sagittarius,2014-10-18,"Current social circumstances may be more complicated than you prefer, prompting you to set your sights on the future. The Moon's visit to your 9th House of Big Ideas boosts your confidence and makes you feel as if you can do anything now. Action-hero Mars is journeying through your adventurous sign, motivating you to stretch further to achieve your goals, however unrealistic they appear to others. Nevertheless, if you pace yourself for the long haul, you might be surprised how quickly you reach your destination."
capricorn,2014-10-18,"You're tempted to execute a power play in order to gain recognition within your family or community today. Tread lightly, for dramatic tactics can be a dangerous political strategy. Reconsider your motives before doing anything that might detract from your current status or diminish your authority. Once you swing into action, you will need to follow your plan through to the end, so think twice before taking an unnecessary risk."
aquarius,2014-10-18,"You aspire to remain objective and emotionally detached, but relationship dynamics get messy now if passion creeps into the picture. Your desire to keep conversations rational might stem from your general distrust of feelings. You prefer to avoid melodramatic meltdowns, but your attempts to sidestep a conflict today only makes matters worse. Muster up the necessary courage to overcome your resistance; facing the truth can set you free."
pisces,2014-10-18,"If you are considering making changes to your daily regimen, the Moon's monthly visit to your 6th House of Habits is a favorable time for self-improvement. Just make sure you are modifying your behavior for the right reasons. For example, if you go on a diet to impress someone with your weight loss, your plan won't likely succeed. The best reason for starting something new is to do it for your own well-being. Transformation requires meaningful motivation, personal commitment and self-discipline."
aries,2014-10-19,"Untangling a misunderstanding with a close friend or partner could be the right thing to do today. Although your first impulse may be to apologize for your role in the current mess, the planetary emphasis on your 7th House of Relationships indicates that both parties share the blame. The Virgo Moon helps you to keep your feelings to yourself until you are fully aware of all the emotional dynamics at play. Luckily, your patience will be rewarded in a surprising way if you don't push ahead too soon."
taurus,2014-10-19,"You aren't happy about an imbalance of power today. You may feel intimidated by someone who appears to have an agenda that is different than yours. Thankfully, you have the ability to create boundaries, if necessary. It's crucial to stand up for your beliefs, but this strategy can backfire if you become overly stubborn. It's not in your best interest to set off on your own since collaborating with others now is your most effective route to success."
gemini,2014-10-19,"You may instinctively resist an authority figure today because you want to follow your own inspiration. You believe you have a better way to do accomplish goals, and all you want is acknowledgement and respect for your strategy. This can be your chance to demonstrate your cleverness as long as you are also pragmatic in your approach. Don't let anyone talk you out of your intended plans; however, listening to an expert's opinion improves your chances of reaching your goals in record time."
cancer,2014-10-19,"It's less stressful to hide behind your invisibility cloak today, but your emotions may be revealed anyway. If you decide to express what's on your mind now, you could receive assistance from the analytical Virgo Moon moving through your 3rd House of Communication. But people might not be interested in hearing all the details of your inner process. Write down your thoughts instead of sharing them; some ideas are best developed without interference from anyone else."
leo,2014-10-19,"There's no reason to overextend your resources today simply because you wish to express your generosity to those you respect. The good news is that everyone is on equal terms and any costs for social activities can be graciously shared. You don't have to prove anything, but you still may want to contribute for some aspect of the day. Just remember that others won't be easily impressed by your current display of magnanimity unless it truly comes from your heart."
virgo,2014-10-19,Your sleep may have been a bit restless last night with the Moon lighting up your 1st House of Self and amplifying the intensity of your dreams. Your vivid fantasies linger today as mischievous Mercury's connection with foggy Neptune makes it tricky to think straight. It's better to feel your way through the emotional haze than to rely on logic now. Make friends with your inner artist rather than your inner scientist for the best results.
libra,2014-10-19,"Although you may be screaming on the inside, it's to your advantage to maintain your gracious manners on the outside. Thankfully, your natural people skills enable you to interact with others in a personable way, even if you lack your normal patience. The fact is you don't need the distraction of conflict today, especially if it doesn't matter who wins in the long run. Instead of attempting to prove you are right, lead by example and concentrate on improving yourself."
scorpio,2014-10-19,"You intuitively know how people will react to your words today, giving you the power to elicit the response you want. It may not be wise to tell everyone what you're thinking now with three planets, including retrograde Mercury, in your 12th House of Secrets. Too much disclosure too fast could sabotage your progress. Slowing down your delivery is one tactic to improve your chances for success, especially if you can find a way to enjoy the process as it unfolds."
sagittarius,2014-10-19,"There's no need to let your frustration get the best of you if everything seems to be taking forever to manifest. You're on the edge of a significant breakthrough but there's no way to make something momentous happen before its natural time. Nevertheless, you still have your part to play; instead of dreaming about big changes in the distant future, take initiative right now. Some of the greatest journeys are accomplished by putting one foot ahead of the other, one tiny step at a time."
capricorn,2014-10-19,"Getting to the bottom of what appears to be even the most trivial of events is more complicated than it appears at first. Although everyone's motives seem close to the surface, you begin to realize how buried the truth really is once you start digging. Instead of wasting your time trying to uncover the source of someone's intentions now, just accept people's actions at face value. You can always return to the scene of the crime and do additional detective work later on if you're still interested."
aquarius,2014-10-19,"There's no valid reason to hold onto negative emotions today as they don't serve a purpose for you. Just try letting the feelings wash over you and dissipate on their own accord. Fortunately, you can benefit the most by focusing on your competency, rather than blaming someone else or defending your position. Ultimately, your reactions have their own bias. If you let others freely say what's on their minds you will find that you share common ground."
pisces,2014-10-19,"You may be divinely inspired today, but cultivating an ethereal perspective is challenging when mundane reality is so demanding. Other people may encourage you to tend to the details of your life now that the exacting Virgo Moon is visiting your 7th House of Relationships. However, getting lost in the minutiae could lead to trouble. Thankfully, you can balance the energy by consciously steering toward bigger ideas and focusing on the possibility of more amazing adventures ahead."
aries,2014-10-20,"You may be drifting on the winds of fate, yet this can still be quite a memorable day if you relinquish control willingly. There might not be any reason to pretend you're in charge if you're not -- and there are no advantages to working extra hard now just to prove a point. Events don't necessarily unfold as expected; graciously accepting whatever happens next can make your journey more enjoyable from the start. Exercising your sense of humor allows you to see life from a more lighthearted perspective."
taurus,2014-10-20,"You might believe you're at a creative standstill today, unable to take a current project to the next level. But there's no need to let frustration sour your day; just find something else to occupy your time for a while. Once you're focusing on a completely different activity, your inspiration could return stronger than ever. Push yourself so you can get the most out of this unexpected burst of energy. Don't underestimate the power of your determination and the depth of your imagination."
gemini,2014-10-20,"Your collaborative skills may be tested today because your patience is running on a rather short fuse. However, losing your temper isn't constructive if you really want to improve the dynamics. Remember, it's wise to keep your emotions in check as long as you're willing to express your feelings later in the day after the urgency passes. Achieving positive results is more likely now if you don't blow things out of proportion. Timing is everything."
cancer,2014-10-20,"If you are hiding your feelings behind a wall of safety today, it may be time to consider what you would do if the emotional dam breaks. Although your anticipation is exhilarating if you can go with the flow, it could also be scary if you maintain resistance. Keep in mind that your justifications for maintaining the status quo won't necessarily prevent change, so you might as well stop fighting the inevitable and embrace the unknown."
leo,2014-10-20,"Burying your head in the sand when it comes to a current financial crunch is a bad idea right from the start. Although you may be facing a tight cash flow now, you can gain a temporary advantage over a situation that has plagued you for a while if you're willing to simply acknowledge the problem. Work hard will stabilize your current position, but don't expect miracles overnight. Yard by yard, it's hard; inch by inch, it's a cinch."
virgo,2014-10-20,"Since you typically have high expectations for yourself, you can be hard on those around you, too. However, it may be time to practice forgiveness now if you recently judged someone's behavior harshly. Understandably, it's difficult to be nice if you're still harboring resentment. Admitting your own shortcomings increases your vulnerability and softening your delivery clears the path to grow closer to others."
libra,2014-10-20,"Complete as much unfinished business as possible today while the Moon is moving through hardworking Virgo. Your extra effort may not have the immediate impact you desire, but if you slack off now, you might not see any results at all. Don't give up when you're so close to achieving your goals; it's better to have a delayed payoff than none at all."
scorpio,2014-10-20,"If you find yourself pulling your hair out while trying to work with others on a project today, don't just ignore the problem by retreating into your self. Instead of withdrawing completely, it may be sufficient to just step back and give yourself some breathing room. It's not that you are necessarily a loner; it's just that everyone else's goals may not interest you all that much. Don't be afraid to set boundaries and let others know what you need. Opening the channels of communication is the first step to finding common ground."
sagittarius,2014-10-20,Your current desire to keep everything on track  enables you to be quite productive today. You expect others to do their part and you don't want any surprises to distract you from your work now. You can increase your efficiency by making a list of the tasks you want to accomplish. Don't focus on what you can't finish; give yourself credit for what you do complete. Shifting your frame of reference helps you see your contributions in a better light.
capricorn,2014-10-20,"You can immediately see several reasons why someone's big plan won't work today. However, you shouldn't let your pragmatism prevent you from jumping on the bandwagon and doing your share. Being practical is only one side of the equation; being pessimistic is something else. Just because you know how much effort is required to fulfill a promise, don't turn your common sense into unnecessary negativity. Recognizing the real deal increases your sense of authority but remember, the power of positive thought can move mountains."
aquarius,2014-10-20,"Although asserting your individuality comes naturally to your unconventional sign, you might need to take extra steps today to protect your right to march to a different drummer. If someone moves in too close for comfort, you may need to reestablish healthy boundaries to maintain your sense of autonomy. But don't confuse your desire for independence with a fear of intimacy. If you want to live a life of no regrets, it's still wise to say yes to love if it knocks on your door."
pisces,2014-10-20,"Your friends or coworkers may be on your case today, pushing you up against your limits. Your first inclination might be to try your hand at a diplomatic strategy to avoid making waves. However, it could be the wrong time to give up your power by pleasing everyone at the cost of your own happiness. Be honest and share your feelings, even if the consequences of your words are temporarily challenging. Ultimately, you will discover your true allies by seeing who respects your needs."
aries,2014-10-21,"A radical shift in relationship dynamics might mean that someone finally understands your point of view. But don't assume that your friends will automatically encourage your independent behavior just because they listen to your story. Instead of pushing your luck, be thankful they accept you as you are rather than trying to change you. You won't gain any further advantage if you continue to pull them outside of their current comfort zone. Knowing when to back off is essential to cultivating a harmonious atmosphere for everyone involved."
taurus,2014-10-21,"You Bulls don't like to change your daily routine unless there is a compelling reason; it's just easier to do things the same way as you did last time. However, the Moon's shift into rational Libra and your 6th House of Habits motivates you to review the basics of your everyday behavior. Consider what works and what doesn't before making improvements to your diet, exercise program and other lifestyle choices. It's the littlest changes now that can have the most positive and lasting effect."
gemini,2014-10-21,"You are obsessed about pursuing a creative whim today, yet you can't just abandon your current tasks. Tending to unfinished business sounds boring when compared with chasing your desires. However, ignoring previous obligations invites unnecessary trouble down the road. Nevertheless, you'll feel better in the long run if you work now and save your self-expression for a more appropriate time. Maintaining your integrity at all costs makes you a hero in the eyes of others."
cancer,2014-10-21,"Acknowledge your inner Crab today by establishing a protective shell around you. A more positive way to create this bubble is to surround yourself with the love of special friends who nurture you and stand by you, no matter what. The cosmic energy is perfect now for settling into your cozy nest and appreciating your family. Even if you must head out into the world at some point to run errands or go the office, staying put for a while can be rejuvenating to your spirit. Home is where the heart is."
leo,2014-10-21,"The energy is rather exciting today, but you can get so caught up in the adrenaline rush that you keep piling more on your schedule. But your attraction to action doesn't mean you have to squeeze everything into one day. Wake up early and get a head start on your chores; make your plans with the intent of establishing a healthy balance rather than creating more noise. Don't go overboard when you finally decide to have some fun; for now, moderation is the key to your success."
virgo,2014-10-21,"You could become so consumed with your desire to acquire something today that your heart becomes intent on buying it. Normally, you're prudent enough in your spending habits that it's easy to pass up a bargain item if you don't really need it. Wait a few days before making a final decision even if you feel very strongly about the purchase. Time works in your favor; gaining a bit of practical perspective now allows you to make a choice that will serve you well into the future."
libra,2014-10-21,"You may reach a point today when your path becomes clear enough to set a new course of action. You could experience a bit of anxiety once you get started, yet the stress actually acts as a catalyst that encourages you to make a choice. Fortunately, your future begins to make more sense once you eliminate unnecessary noise by fixing on a single direction. Paradoxically, narrowing your focus now actually increases your options over the days ahead."
scorpio,2014-10-21,"Your weariness could catch up with you today, especially if you feel as if you're carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders. Thankfully, your fate is not determined by your current actions alone, so don't try to do everything all at once. Instead, find some time for contemplation where you have the privacy needed to refocus on your dreams. Sink into your feelings without trying to change them or bring others into your inner process. You will emerge from your little retreat with renewed vigor, ready to make the most of the challenges ahead."
sagittarius,2014-10-21,"You have your eyes set on the horizon but still have unfulfilled promises keeping you in the past. This period of renewal that began last month is coming to an end next week as energetic Mars leaves your farsighted sign. Use these last days wisely by imagining what you want to happen next. Make intentional visualization a part of your daily routine to empower you to manifest your dreams. Luckily, you can positively impact your future by changing how you see it."
capricorn,2014-10-21,"You may be preoccupied with professional issues today and your current role in the community. Although others naturally look to you for guidance, they don't necessarily want you to take over. You are only needed you to listen, reflect upon what they have said and add your seasoned perspective. You can be an amazingly effective leader now by being part of the team instead of assuming authority and telling everyone what to do. Believe it or not, taking the time to help others also helps you."
aquarius,2014-10-21,"You are eagerly anticipating what's around the next corner, but it's not healthy to live so far into the future that you detach from current circumstances. Spending quality time with your friends and family inspires you to refocus your attention on the present moment. Fortunately, you receive cosmic support from action-hero Mars now moving through adventurous Sagittarius. Your path to happiness is one of duality; you can live in the present while still dreaming of the future."
pisces,2014-10-21,"There's no reason to succumb to self-doubt today, even if something reminds you of your personal limitations. Old fears aren't necessarily relevant to your present circumstances anyhow. But don't keep your anxiety buried or it will continue to grow unchecked. Find a trusted friend or colleague and express your feelings. Simply discussing your concerns helps dissipate negativity before it causes any further trouble. No burden is too heavy when it's shared."
aries,2014-10-22,"You have no easy outlet for your passions today, and could grow uncomfortable with the dynamics of the situation. Perhaps the real problem is that you can't express your negative emotions. If you need to let off steam, it's wise to find a less disruptive way to vent your feelings. You must get to the source, however, to discover a permanent solution to the current tension."
taurus,2014-10-22,"Minor details at work could pull your attention away from the list of things you should be doing. It may seem like you're being drawn into working on unnecessary tasks and there is no way around them. However, approaching the situation from an either/or perspective won't lead to a way out of your dilemma. Roll up your sleeves and willingly jump in to help; honoring your own needs is more rewarding once you've done your good deed for the day."
gemini,2014-10-22,"Dark and brooding feelings might still be lingering, yet you can begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Even if you try to experience pleasure, it may take another day or two to be completely free from your current stress. Meanwhile, don't lose touch with your own inner voice or you could also lose your ability to make magic. Take a few deep breaths and slow down; transformation is a gradual process that requires time to unfold."
cancer,2014-10-22,"Staying at home sounds like an enticing idea today, but unfortunately, you probably need to wait until the weekend before you retreat into your shell. Make the most of your day by remaining cognizant of your emotions, even when it's not appropriate to express them. This strategy may not fix the ills of the world, but it can help you be more pleasant to others, which in turn could improve your mood."
leo,2014-10-22,"The noise level in your hectic life kicks up another notch today. You're in your element now as you're swept up in a buzzing hive of activity, although the comings and goings of your fellow worker bees might be a tad distracting. Just remember that you also have your own obligations to fulfill on time. Sort out your priorities early in the day so you don't miss out on what's most important."
virgo,2014-10-22,"You could be feeling as if you are stuck in a corner with no clear way out. However, circumstances are in flux, and within a few days you may discover a viable escape out of your current dilemma. Try not to let minor annoyances dampen your spirit; negativity can hamper your overall journey in more ways than one. Luckily, positive thinking just might take you as far as you need to go."
libra,2014-10-22,These are intense times as you are required to tie up loose ends while simultaneously visualizing the challenges ahead. The future seems to be arriving with great speed and the big question now is whether or not you are ready to put your plan into action. But don't rock the boat by trying so hard to prove yourself. You have a much better chance of succeeding today if you don't move too quickly. A steady hand and a healthy dose of determination will carry you to the next chapter of your life.
scorpio,2014-10-22,"Your preparations are coming to fruition and the big event is just around the bend. But your nerves are on edge today, and you aren't sure how anything will work out. To make matters worse, just as you start seeing progress, your plans go into a stall. Don't worry; you won't crash land if you wait for circumstances to catch up with your desires. Impulsively switching your strategy is not a good idea; you're making more headway than you realize now, even if everything is taking longer than you wish."
sagittarius,2014-10-22,"A whirlwind of social events brightens your day with wonderful people; however, the hectic pace can be too crazy for even you fun-loving Archers. In fact, you may prefer to think about being with your friends rather than actually spending time  with them now. Remember, the key is keeping a sense of balance. You don't need to go into seclusion to maintain your composure. Just give yourself enough time alone to process your feelings so you can focus on the present moment when you're in the company of others."
capricorn,2014-10-22,"It's finally time to put your master plan into motion, even if you are currently motivated by the stress of a deadline. You're ready to move from the realms of contemplation into the world of practicality. But don't be afraid to ask for help if you need some. Your associates will most likely support your efforts for they know from experience how responsible and hardworking you can be when pursuing your ambitions. Just keep in mind that others may not jump in until invited. Don't let your pride get in the way of your success."
aquarius,2014-10-22,"Something is amiss at work now, and you cannot rest until you put your finger on the source of the problem. The circumstances may be a bit confusing, for on the surface all the pieces fit  together quite nicely. Still, there are strange undercurrents and it is too early to tell which direction they will carry you. Even if you are ready to act today, wait until the tension dissipates and everything feels right. In moments of great uncertainty there is also great opportunity for positive change."
pisces,2014-10-22,"You might not find it easy to get in touch with your own heart today. In fact, you may be left feeling emotionally high and dry now, yet you are still craving the intensity of deep emotions. Fortunately, you Fish can create your own waters to swim in by conjuring up your ideal world in your imagination. However, this is just the first step on your journey to fulfillment. A solid plan and serious dedication are what you really need if you want to manifest your dreams."
aries,2014-10-23,"Ironically, what you say today might not have as much impact as what you don't say. Although the Scorpio New Moon Eclipse rattles your 8th House of Intimacy, it's difficult to ask for your heart's desire. Your emotions may seem detached from your communication unless you make a conscious choice to include them in your story. Don't wait for a better moment; if you take a chance and tell a loved one what you want, you might just get what you need."
taurus,2014-10-23,"When you wish upon a star today, you might be asking for your life to return to a simpler state. However, relationship dynamics may continue to grow a bit out of control. Your interactions with others contain hidden layers of complexity as the Scorpio Solar Eclipse rocks your 7th House of Partners. You might be willing to put up with temporary logistical problems if you can see your way through the entanglement. Just keep moving toward your destination, one step at a time."
gemini,2014-10-23,"It's not too late to improve your daily routine, even if it's an upgrade you should have made much sooner. Today's Scorpio Solar Eclipse plants the seeds in your 6th House of Habits, indicating sudden changes that can set a series of profound consequences into motion. The potential is greater than you realize, so make every action count as much as possible while you have the planetary magic on your side."
cancer,2014-10-23,"Whether or not you realize it, you are on the edge of a creative breakthrough; however, you must be the one to take the initiative to make it happen. Don't allow discouragement to settle in today, even if it feels like progress has come to an abrupt standstill. This Scorpio Solar Eclipse polarizes your 5th House of Love and Play, opening a door to exciting opportunities on the romantic front. Even if you are eager with anticipation, remember that good things come to those who wait."
leo,2014-10-23,"Your emotions may be playing a game of tug-of-war with your actions today, and you don't know which one will emerge a winner. However, your current tendency is to withhold deep feelings while you smile and just do whatever is necessary to keep the peace. But the Scorpio Solar Eclipse falls in your 4th House of Security, making this a tough time if you don't acknowledge your desires. Protecting your heart seems like a good idea at first, but you might regret it later on. Following your bliss is now your fastest route to happiness."
virgo,2014-10-23,"It might seem as if you have been quietly planning forever, but now it's time to start sharing your ideas with others. The Scorpio New Moon Eclipse marks a turning point in your 3rd House of Communication. Don't hesitate; get your best thoughts out into the open since they don't do any good running around inside your head. There may not be a better opportunity to initiate passionate discussions about what you want to happen in the next chapter of your life, so seize the moment before it passes. You may be pleasantly surprised by who steps up to support your cause."
libra,2014-10-23,"You can't share every feeling that's important to you now without rocking the stability of your life. The Scorpio Solar Eclipse is shaking your 2nd House of Self-Esteem and possibly stirring up a cloud of self-doubt. Unfortunately, hiding crucial information creates a ripple effect, and the subtle disturbances can quickly build into destructive waves, sending you on a journey of self-discovery. Don't rush the process; once you better understand your own core values you'll know exactly what you need to say and do to create positive change."
scorpio,2014-10-23,"Turn off the regularly scheduled program and walk into the surrealistic world that awaits you. Today's New Moon Eclipse occurs in your sign, symbolizing the initiation process you are about to experience. With nebulous Neptune in the picture, you're probably feeling hopeful about the life-altering possibilities that are right in front of you. But don't let go of the shadows on a whim; analyze what's holding you back and why you're still avoiding change. Once you understand the source of your resistance, transformation is soon to follow."
sagittarius,2014-10-23,"Your boundaries are not as strong as you'd like today, so you might steer away from emotional involvements to safeguard your heart. You may even feel vulnerable and act upon the need to protect yourself from others. Go ahead and retreat to engage in the deep soul-searching brought about by the Scorpio Solar Eclipse, occurring in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. There's no reason to share your feelings with anyone else until you're certain the time is right. This is one journey best traveled alone."
capricorn,2014-10-23,"You may be paying rapt attention to what your peers are doing today, as if their current behavior could reveal something crucial about your life. However, the emotionally extreme Scorpio Solar Eclipse agitates your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, making it nearly impossible to know what you might want in a few days. Stop trying to control every aspect of every situation so you come out on top. Focusing on the future is fine as long as you don't miss out on the magic of the present moment."
aquarius,2014-10-23,"Your innate ability to cool your emotions contributes to your air of mystery today and increases your magnetic charm. But you have little patience for playing games now that you want to climb the ladder of success. The Scorpio Solar Eclipse lands in your 10th House of Career, motivating you to concentrate on your professional ambitions. Speak straight from the heart when sharing your plans with your colleagues and watch them line up to be on your team."
pisces,2014-10-23,It's time to take your special brand of logic out of your tool box today and draw a map that shows the path to your dream destination. You might even believe that you can make your amazing fantasies come true now that the Scorpio Solar Eclipse is activating your 9th House of Big Adventure. Start by visualizing whatever you want to do over the upcoming months. Then jot down the critical milestones that you wish to reach along the way. Use this guideline to stay on track as you move toward fulfilling your most creative visions.
aries,2014-10-24,"You might end up expending precious energy and exhausting yourself for no reason today. Although a friend or lover may seem distant, your current situation ultimately serves you well if you simply learn your lesson. But don't attack someone needlessly just because you're feeling insecure. Admit that you can make mistakes and then proceed with caution the next time around."
taurus,2014-10-24,"You tend to play well with others at work because you're normally not interested in making waves. Nevertheless, you might feel as if you're placed in an awkward position today if someone questions your motives or undermines your efforts. But instead of wasting time defending your behavior, put your energy toward reaching your goals. If necessary, retreat and work on your own until the tension passes. Take the high road and let your integrity be the final word."
gemini,2014-10-24,"It seems as if success is within your grasp but your progress could grind to a screeching halt today if you expect too much all at once. There's no need to be afraid of acting on your desires now, assuming you are sticking with the facts and not looking for an easy way out. However, you can reach farther than ever if you lead with your common sense; seize the moment and seal the deal."
cancer,2014-10-24,"You can't escape the burden of responsibility today, but you should focus on the positive of the current situation rather than where you might fall short. You're less inclined to take yourself too seriously today, even if everyone else is acknowledging your authority. However, you're not going to singlehandedly solve anyone's problems, no matter how much you want to help. Offer whatever assistance you can and then give others sufficient space and time to choose their own paths."
leo,2014-10-24,"Your patience may seem out of character today, especially in light of your current enthusiasm for getting the most out of life. However, separating your needs from those around you can help you rationalize your deliberate behavior now. But don't bother trying to explain to everyone why you're moving slowly; just trust your instincts and reach for the stars at your own pace. Although it may take a while for others to notice, the cosmic energy is already beginning to shift and your progress will soon be evident."
virgo,2014-10-24,"Although you think you know exactly what you want today, your goals are more confused than you realize. In fact, your unbridled optimism could prompt you to make a faulty assumption. You believe you understand what's lurking just beyond your perceptions, but getting the rest of the story might be an elusive task. Don't force any issues; it's healthier to delay an important decision than to make a choice without having the right information at your disposal. Patience will ultimately pay off with the truth."
libra,2014-10-24,"Your anticipation grows today since expansive Jupiter boosts your confidence and raises your expectations. Nevertheless, you might feel as if your friends aren't supporting you enough, but blaming others for their lack of enthusiasm doesn't help your cause. Acknowledging your peers for who they are and not for what they can or cannot do on your behalf gives them the freedom to respond without pressure. Just because change is in the air doesn't mean that you should rush it."
scorpio,2014-10-24,"Someone you respect might promise you the Moon, yet you still want to see concrete results. Your willingness to give others the benefit of the doubt works in your favor, but only up to a point. Fortunately, you won't likely get lost in such high expectations that you end up being disappointed. You're better off now if you can step back and keep everything in a healthy perspective. Bring your dreams back down to earth if you want them to come true."
sagittarius,2014-10-24,"You prefer to fly beneath the radar today with the Moon hiding out in your 12th House of Escapism. However, you may have a lot more fun if you purposefully place yourself directly in the middle of the action. Nevertheless, you still might not feel very social now and it's your choice if you decide to bow out of a previous commitment. There's no reason to defend your actions as long as you remember to be nice when you say no. It's not your responsibility to entertain everyone all the time."
capricorn,2014-10-24,"You're working harder than you like now, yet your heart might not be in your current job. You wish you could compartmentalize your feelings so you're able to meet your financial responsibilities on schedule. However, you also want to make substantial progress toward your ideal career path. Fortunately, you can have your cake and eat it too if you don't let your disappointment show today; waiting for just a few more days will bring you closer to living the life you want."
aquarius,2014-10-24,"Your path to success might not be as direct as you wish today. Although you're willing to take a circuitous route to accomplish your career objectives, it's tricky to make a concrete plan if you can't see where your current course is leading. It may be more advantageous now to temporarily set your long-term goals aside. Destiny is more likely to work its magic if you keep your dreams alive by focusing all your energy on the present moment."
pisces,2014-10-24,"It may be disconcerting to observe how reality doesn't match up to your expectations today. You might be inclined to choose to steer clear of any conversations that could touch on tough topics. Unfortunately, avoiding the shadows gives you a lopsided view now because you're intentionally denying the larger issues at play. There's nothing wrong with being optimistic, but you'll be happier in the long run if you are operating in the real world right from the start."
aries,2014-10-25,"You say whatever is on the tip of your tongue today; however, you could step into deep water so quickly that you don't have time to get your bearings. Unfortunately, you may be even more impulsive than ever with your words now that mischievous Mercury moves forward in your 7th House of Relationships. Although you might be tempted to stir up some drama, you're still better off approaching a conversation about your feelings with thoughtful deliberation. Fools rush in where angels fear to tread."
taurus,2014-10-25,"You feel like royalty now as you luxuriate in the splendor of your own domain. But just because jolly Jupiter is camping out in your 4th House of Home doesn't mean you will get everything you want now. Stay optimistic, even if you face a minor setback. It's crucial to project a positive attitude now that the Sun is traveling through your 7th House of Partnerships. Setting the bar high encourages your friends and family to step up to the plate and give it their best shots."
gemini,2014-10-25,"Playing to your audience is tricky business if you aren't on stage today. It's tough to be a teacher if you don't have a class. Above all, you need a stable platform from which to express your creative ideas. Nevertheless, you could still make real progress on a project now by thinking outside of the box. Solidifying routines may still require additional time, yet creating structure reliably leads to greater opportunities down the road."
cancer,2014-10-25,"Your feelings are so tangible that they could overwhelm your plans today. However, avoiding serious emotional commitments now allows you to encourage your imagination to meander without restraint. Keep in mind that even the most impractical thoughts can have practical consequences. Exploration of your inner worlds leads to outer rewards."
leo,2014-10-25,"Everyone might be relying on you to be the nurturing one of the group with four planets residing in your 4th House of Emotional Security. Additionally, others expect you to entertain and amuse them now. However, you're simply not in the mood to put on a performance and you want to avoid the spotlight completely. Tracing your feelings back to their underlying causes can make a real difference, enabling you to make positive changes that last."
virgo,2014-10-25,"You would be quite content these days if people left you alone for a while. You long for seclusion and may greatly benefit by carving out some quiet time for self-reflection. Still, there might be one or two close friends you really want to share your thoughts with now; just don't let your socializing grow out of hand. Your self-esteem depends on your ability to establish healthy boundaries while still being vulnerable with those you love."
libra,2014-10-25,"Sometimes making the simplest changes in a relationship can take longer than you expect. Thankfully, the Sun's alignment with your key planet Venus refreshes your dreams and widens your vision of the future. Paradoxically, your confidence is on the rise, even as you sink deeper into your feelings. Nevertheless, carefully building on a solid emotional foundation makes more sense than rushing ahead just because you like what you see on the horizon."
scorpio,2014-10-25,"Charming Venus cozies up to the Sun in your 1st House of Personality, you won't likely be short on charisma -- even if others criticize or attack your plan. This is your moment to shine; you're at the top of your game, so eagerly invite in every opportunity that knocks at your door."
sagittarius,2014-10-25,"You are a natural-born traveler yet responsibilities are stacking up today, prohibiting your free movement. If you do end up taking a trip now, it will likely be for business, not pleasure. Nevertheless, you still may want to go somewhere special, so expand your intellectual sphere by researching a new and different destination. Don't wait for fate to decide your future; stand up and be counted as someone who makes their own opportunities."
capricorn,2014-10-25,"You might have to work with a very stubborn person today, someone who seems bent on turning a simple exercise into a totally frustrating experience. Pride is not a strength at this time, but a sure sign of weakness. Thankfully, real cooperation is possible when humility is present and there is respect for all parties involved. Remember that bossing others around won't get you what you want now, but practicing compassion could just do the trick."
aquarius,2014-10-25,"You want to step back and take in the whole picture today, so you are quite willing to walk away from the details and leave them to someone else. You're not interested in superficial matters; you're too serious to get sidetracked, especially if you're seeking power and integrity now. However, be ready to drop whatever you are doing if someone with convincing sincerity shows up. The right person can act as a catalyst that changes everything for the better."
pisces,2014-10-25,You can transform the most boring drudgery into an exciting adventure today by simply putting all of your heart into your work. The same old chores that usually annoy you to no end suddenly invite you to explore your imagination and cultivate your creativity. The good news is that you can be productive and playful at the same time as long as you are willing to work hard without taking yourself too seriously.
aries,2014-10-26,"Domestic chores don't feel so tedious today because they shift your attention away from the complexities of relationships. You might not find a quick fix to messy emotional dynamics that have developed recently. However, a solution is more likely once you take a few steps back and give everyone involved a bit of breathing room. Thankfully, doing mundane projects at home is more than just a distraction; they can be a wonderful way to keep busy and feel good about your accomplishments."
taurus,2014-10-26,"Your resources might be spread too thin today, making this a perfect time to regroup as you consider what to do next. Thankfully, your common sense leads you in the right direction as you consciously direct your energy back to center. But don't avoid hard work as whatever you put off now will require even more effort if you have to do it later. Scaling back your long-term plans empowers you to achieve your more immediate goals one small step at a time."
gemini,2014-10-26,"A serious encounter with someone who means business could pull you out of the clouds and bring you crashing back down to earth. You might not be very happy when you are reminded of your unfinished chores, but there's no one to blame but yourself. The real power of now is most evident when you focus on what is, rather than the possibility of what could be. Instead of risking happiness on the unknown future, place your bet on what you can manifest in the present moment."
cancer,2014-10-26,"Your current commitments might have you so stressed out that you can't find time to pursue more relaxing activities today. But don't let resentment ruin an otherwise productive day because negative emotions are just a waste of precious energy. Instead of seeking to fulfill your immediate desires, a more mature and reserved approach to life now will give way to a deeper satisfaction later on. You will feel a lot better about your future once you can see some progress in the present."
leo,2014-10-26,"Your optimistic attitude fades into a more realistic outlook today when you realize that your goals will take longer to achieve than you originally thought. However, there's no room for discouragement because it only further impedes your progress. It's more important to stay on course than it is to cross a few more unrelated tasks off your list. Don't rush through your work; slow down and make every little action count. Quality, not quantity, matters more than ever."
virgo,2014-10-26,"The intensity of your feelings begins to cool today, but this isn't a license to shift into a more analytical mode. Instead, use this time to assimilate recent experiences and prepare for another round of engagement by sorting out your priorities. Although gathering useful data can be comforting, you already have gathered enough facts. Instead, get out of your head by practicing spontaneous acts of joyful self-expression. Letting your imagination run wild adds magic to your life and a smile to your face."
libra,2014-10-26,"Although you might have been swept up in a recent flurry of social activities, it's time to return to your responsibilities. Others may lean on you today because they see the stability you are creating and they hope your practicality will rub off on them. However, it makes more sense to stay focused on your own issues for now; you won't be able to help anyone else until you help yourself. Leading by example is more inspirational than you think."
scorpio,2014-10-26,"Managing your complex calendar efficiently now is crucial to juggling all your obligations. Thankfully, you can probably figure out how to fit everything in, but you must consider all aspects of your schedule for the weeks ahead. You will be able to deliver on all your promises as long as you fully assess the timeline for each and every job. Putting everything in its proper place is the first step to success."
sagittarius,2014-10-26,"You may not be ready to declare the party over yet, even if you understand the consequences of ignoring pressing responsibilities. Nevertheless, the good times cannot last unless you also tend to more serious business. Instead of pushing your luck by chasing after another opportunity for fun and frivolity, be wise and shift your attention toward stabilizing your finances, replenishing your body and getting back to basics."
capricorn,2014-10-26,"You have a real chance to shine now and it would be a big mistake to procrastinate any longer. It's time to establish a pace of work that you can sustain and settle in for the long haul. Although momentum may be pulling you toward your goals, it's in your best interest to encourage the process by applying yourself diligently and staying singularly focused on your destination. The ladder of success is climbed one rung at a time."
aquarius,2014-10-26,"Keep your eyes wide open because important lessons are heading your way and you won't want to miss this chance for personal growth. Although you are often more preoccupied with the future than the present moment, your imagination and dreams are now stuck on practical issues of immediate concern. Don't forget that the work you do today will impact your life for many tomorrows."
pisces,2014-10-26,"Escapist behaviors only court trouble today, so it's best to look at your life through the most pragmatic lens you can find. Although you are often easily distracted by your fantasies, you are now able to see beyond the enticing dreams and ephemeral visions. Keep bringing your thoughts back to the hard cold facts. The most practical approach to life is currently the most successful. Put your rose-colored glasses away for another day when the stakes are not so high."
aries,2014-10-27,"Your revolutionary scheme might be just what the boss ordered today, but you still must take a chance and communicate it to others. Your plan can't resolve the situation if your thoughts stay trapped inside your head. However, you may be fooling yourself if you think the magic will happen on its own. Unfortunately, you won't know what you can do unless you try. Luckily, your positive attitude and persistent determination are sensible antidotes to the current stagnation."
taurus,2014-10-27,"The boundaries between your fantasies and reality are muddled today, making it tricky to know which is which. Nevertheless, you might believe that you're fully in touch with the truth and eagerly share your perspective with someone who will listen. Unfortunately, you're not doing anyone a favor by raising expectations to an unrealistic level. However, your message could have a great deal of impact on others, so choose your words carefully to give someone a much-needed boost of confidence."
gemini,2014-10-27,"Capturing your brilliant ideas is an act of futility today because they come and go so quickly. You may try to get serious and put your innovative thoughts into action, but even your most ingenious plans might not be very practical now. If you decide to take a chance, don't rush the process. A slow and deliberate approach will take you further than trying to make everything happen all at once. Collaborating with others adds an important layer of reality to your work."
cancer,2014-10-27,"You can spin fantastic stories of romance and intrigue today that actually sound like the gospel truth. Your tales can even weave a sticky web that entangles others in your dreams. Your creative streak is a pleasant distraction to you and utterly fascinating to a not-so-secret admirer. Nevertheless, you can influence reality in a positive manner if you just remember to use caution when dancing on the fine line between fact and fancy."
leo,2014-10-27,"Your obsession with solving a mystery intensifies today when it becomes obvious that someone isn't being forthcoming. The more that's kept hidden from you, the deeper you dig. You might even become overly possessive with someone and could have difficulty letting go of your jealousy. Putting on a dramatic display won't necessarily produce the results that you want. Express what's in your heart without letting your fears run away with your love."
virgo,2014-10-27,"Openly sharing your feelings today has a direct impact on your future. But don't jump to any conclusions before you lay the groundwork. Making too many assumptions only creates trouble down the road. Your current effectiveness in communication stems from the fact that you genuinely care about others, and this sincerity comes across in your words and actions. Even if you're only sharing facts, you can do it so pleasantly now that people stop to listen to every word you're saying."
libra,2014-10-27,"You have a real opportunity to experience profound emotional healing today with a member of your family. If there are things that need to be said, express your feelings kindly now without blaming anyone else for your predicament. Adopting a sensitive approach allows you to state a truth that might be hurtful at any other time. Fortunately, it's unlikely that someone will take offense if your intentions are clear from the start. If you reveal your vulnerability first, others are likely to do the same in return."
scorpio,2014-10-27,"You may feel waves of contentment sweep over you now that sweet Venus is sitting pretty in your sign. But confusing Neptune is also in the picture, making it nearly impossible to tell if your comfort level is based on unattainable hopes or actual circumstances. Luckily, you're able to quickly banish any unexpressed fears so negativity doesn't come creeping into your day. Let your imagination wander and give your inner child permission to come out to play."
sagittarius,2014-10-27,"You might have to put on your listening cap today if someone close to you really needs to talk. Thankfully, starting a conversation is easy since others want to tell you positive things rather than what is actually bothering them. Nevertheless, asking direct questions cuts right to the core issue. Cultivating clear communication channels gives others an opportunity to discuss a subject that truly matters."
capricorn,2014-10-27,"You're often the one who saves the day, but you won't become a hero by trying to maintain the status quo now. You must push through your fears and take a risk by sharing your truth. You might think it's safer to stick with the facts today, but it may be more productive to let your emotions become transparent. Although you think this personal admission shows weakness, coming clean can actually work in your favor. Speak directly from your heart if you really want to experience breakthroughs in your relationships."
aquarius,2014-10-27,"You can skillfully project your most brilliant and lovable side today. You are quite personable now without much effort. However, the danger is your temptation to turn on the charm as part of your agenda to avoid the real issue at hand. If you are looking to gain power or trying to manipulate a situation, your cleverness may backfire and you might wish you didn't say anything at all. Take the high road and channel your good fortune in a positive direction for everyone involved."
pisces,2014-10-27,"Say what you think must be said today, even if you're afraid of how others may react. You are experiencing the intensity of the moment now that the passionate Scorpio Sun is trining surreal Neptune in your sensitive sign. Happily, you're optimistic about the future, even with such powerful emotions swirling around in the atmosphere. Your connection to your heart inspires others to delve deeper to match your honesty and integrity."
aries,2014-10-28,"Although you start the day with plans of your own, you could end up playing a supporting role in someone else's story today. There are responsibilities that have your name on them -- and you know exactly what's expected of you. Nevertheless, you still may be secretly searching for an escape route. Although you might believe you can get away with a bit of self-declared play time, it's not a good day to test your theory. Apply your creativity to working within the system instead of trying to beat it."
taurus,2014-10-28,"You're not nearly as rational as you think you are today as you firm up your plans for the future. It's as if one of your dreams took control of the wheel before you even realized what happened. Unfortunately, attempts to regain your authority have the opposite effect now. Surrendering to your imagination is currently the most reliable source of inspiration. Sometimes taking the path of least resistance leads to a surprising good turn of fortune."
gemini,2014-10-28,"The pressure to perform your regular duties can be relentless today, but you find mundane reality more monotonous than ever. You're itching to stir up a bit of mischief and your coworkers may even see you as a troublemaker now. You have been known to create an illusion or two in your time and you might just surprise others by pulling a rabbit out of a hat. Luckily, you can make your magic look effortless if you're willing to put in extra work when no one is watching. There are no shortcuts; practice makes perfect."
cancer,2014-10-28,"You could grow frazzled if too many responsibilities are pulling you in too many directions. You take a certain amount of pride when others rely on you for support and encouragement. But no one seems to be watching out for your best interests now, leaving you with the uncomfortable job of safeguarding your boundaries. Keep your dreams alive by sharing them with someone you trust. Ultimately, you're the only one who can restore balance into your life. There's no shame in asking for assistance if you need it."
leo,2014-10-28,"Harness an electric spark of creativity today and use it to turn frogs into princes and princesses. Although others may not be privy to your inner process now, it's one of those days when you intuitively know that your mind is capable of doing anything. If you can imagine it, you can manifest it. You are as magical now as you believe and have the power to mold reality to conform to your dreams."
virgo,2014-10-28,"You are thriving in your creative element now and are eager to push as hard as you can to get real results. However, your dedication and persistence may not be as visible on the surface today as your apparent optimism. Don't waste time wondering what others think about your behavior. Set priorities, make a plan and stick to your strategy regardless of anyone else's opinion. Exploring your artistic nature can be more productive than you think."
libra,2014-10-28,"Insecurities over money matters may be enough to send you into a tailspin today. Ironically, others might see you as more lighthearted and charming than you actually feel. You're not sure that current circumstances are unfolding according to your plan and you're not exactly sure how to get your finances back under control. Letting some of the details slide for a little while makes good sense as long as you don't actually believe your cash flow will improve on its own. In the meantime, your positive attitude generates its own special brand of prosperity."
scorpio,2014-10-28,"You can see a break in the clouds as your workload begins to lighten today. The sky grows bluer and your pace of accomplishment quickens. Fortunately, the combination of these positive changes frees up some well-deserved leisure time. The good news is that you can work both ends of the spectrum now. You don't have to let go completely; applying your energy to your goals still produces benefits. Nevertheless, be ready to escape for a while when given the chance."
sagittarius,2014-10-28,"Seeking to balance the right amount of realism and optimism regarding a current situation is quite a challenging task today. On one hand, if you're overly confident, others might think you're just trying to put a positive spin on the events of the day -- and they won't believe your story. However, if you're not sufficiently optimistic, then your coworkers may not join in your parade and your much-needed support will wane. Your success depends on your willingness to make adjustments until you get it right."
capricorn,2014-10-28,"You don't have to act so seriously today; you could change the dynamics by simply changing your attitude. At first, it may be uncomfortable to surrender the control you worked so hard to gain -- but perhaps it's time to try a new strategy. Share your most inspirational message so your associates will eagerly pick up the reins as you set them down. Others are more likely to take responsibility if you're ready to give them a chance."
aquarius,2014-10-28,"An unexpected interaction with someone at work dramatically changes the course of your day. It's as if invisible chess pieces are being moved around in another dimension. When everything is in exactly the right position, the veil between worlds grows thin and something profound happens. Some surprises are more shocking than others, and today's events can certainly have a magical and fated feeling. Don't resist your destiny; instead, embrace it with an open heart."
pisces,2014-10-28,"It would be a shame if you were to waste today's magical powers on idle daydreaming. Your fantasies hold the key to your success, but you must discover how to unlock the possibilities. Persistence is your unlikely secret weapon now; you have something very special to share with the world so don't give up before you figure out how to access your creative potential."
aries,2014-10-29,"You may still be surfing slightly ahead of the cosmic wave, but the tidal backwash finally catches up with you today. You must set a sustainable pace at work or you might find yourself in over your head for the next few weeks. Even though this sounds counter-intuitive, your best strategy now is to slow down. Establish your priorities, map out your activities and then execute your plan with confidence."
taurus,2014-10-29,"You're humming a happy little tune now that you're feeling more laid-back. Although you have concrete goals in mind, you're not as concerned with reaching them today. Of course, certain details sometimes fall through the cracks, but the surprises are at a minimum. It's as if you worked through the growing pains of a new project and you can finally settle into a manageable routine. But don't get too comfortable or complacent. It's one thing to appreciate the simplicity of life; it's quite another to quit reaching for the stars."
gemini,2014-10-29,"You tend to thrive on being really busy, but it's not wise to wait for a reality check that tells you to slow down. But you are known to move quickly when you dance the dance of communication. Whether you like it or not, you need to adopt a snail's pace now and commit to following through on those matters which are most important. Nothing is gained by frantically running around in circles. You will end up accomplishing more if you take on less."
cancer,2014-10-29,"You're surrounded by people everywhere you go  today, leaving you little time to pursue your personal agenda. Perhaps connecting with your peers takes on an even more prominent role in your life if you decide not to strike out on your own now. You might even feel pressured by someone to join them in a project, task or even a fun adventure. Surprisingly, exploring your relationship to others can broaden your horizons on many fronts."
leo,2014-10-29,"It's not that everything needs to come to a complete standstill today, but there are warning signals you should take seriously. Analyze all the possibilities before blindly barreling ahead with your ambitious plans. You can't just rush through your day without personally impacting others -- especially those you love and those who love you. Stick to the tried and true methods to keep everyone happy now and save your creative brilliance for another time."
virgo,2014-10-29,"Sometimes you want to wait for everything to be perfect before allowing yourself to kick up your heels and have fun. In fact, your current circumstances may seem solid and stable enough for you to add some spontaneity and creativity into your life. But don't try to change so much all at once that you jeopardize your new high hopes before they even get off the ground. Believe it or not, you can mix things up without turning your life upside down."
libra,2014-10-29,"You prefer being the type of friend who always gives a kind word of encouragement, but sometimes tough love is the best thing you can offer. If there's something you've been waiting to tell someone, this is an opportune time to tackle a difficult subject. Just because you have a stern message doesn't mean you can't be compassionate in your delivery. Don't second guess your inner voice when it comes to relationships; speaking from your heart demonstrates how much you care."
scorpio,2014-10-29,"You have a plethora of communication tools at your disposal now, enabling you to integrate your feelings into your daily life. Perhaps things really are settling down and you will have some time to think about the chaos you recently experienced. But don't be too hard on yourself while you are weighing and judging your behavior. Being the best you can be is plenty enough for any human -- including you."
sagittarius,2014-10-29,"It's time to pull back on the reins of expansion and use your enthusiasm to accomplish as much as possible. Instead of planning for the future, plow the field that you are walking upon now. Take care of the business that is on your desk today, not the business plans for next year's growth. Be fully present in the moment, whether you're dealing with home and family issues or professional matters. You won't go wrong as long as you have the courage to show up and be your authentic self."
capricorn,2014-10-29,"You may feel as if your emotions are settling down, but social dynamics could still be extremely confusing. There's nothing wrong with exhibiting caution, but your feelings may rise so unexpectedly that they could catch you off guard. If you feel like you're losing your center of gravity, stop and take your bearings. Once you are certain about your current position, you should be able to swing back into motion with no trouble at all."
aquarius,2014-10-29,"Unconscious fears and desires may be the source of very real feelings now. Even if you're in denial about what's bubbling up into your awareness, you have time to acclimate to the new emotional landscape. Don't waste your energy trying to figure out why you're encountering so much melodrama. Instead, try to integrate the new information into your point of view. Keeping an open mind gives your imagination a chance to reveal new opportunities."
pisces,2014-10-29,"Something isn't quite right today, but you can't put your finger on it. It might be one of those unknowable and elusive things that you may as well forget about trying to figure out. In the meantime, take a look at how your friends and associates are pushing your buttons. Although you can't shift the dynamics, you can become more aware of the emotional undercurrents. There's no need to make any sudden moves now; there will be plenty of opportunities for change later on."
aries,2014-10-30,"It's time to face ghosts from your past, because things can become more difficult over the months ahead if you don't. It may be all too tempting to just ignore old memories, but they will continue to haunt you unless you find a way to positively integrate them into your current world. Although you might choose to seek harmony through your relationships with others now, true peace of mind cannot be found until you realize the balance you are searching for is within yourself."
taurus,2014-10-30,"Your stubborn nature might get the best of you today, especially if you're not paying attention to the warning signs. If you notice that you get emotionally worked up  while defending your position or arguing for your point of view, stop for a moment to consider what's really at stake. What are you afraid of? Your own answer can help you decide if it's wise to hold your posture of resistance or if it's time to let it go and move on."
gemini,2014-10-30,"Your own long-held beliefs can crystallize if under attack today. It's not that you are particularly threatened by anyone, but conflict brings up old fears that get in the way of your current interactions. Your memories are a mixed blessing now. You would like to forget the past in order to enjoy yourself in the present moment, but something is holding you back just enough to keep you from going too far. Don't sidestep the tension in favor of pursuing pleasure; creatively resolving your differences is empowering for everyone involved."
cancer,2014-10-30,"You're doing a balancing act today as your feelings undergo radical change. However, your shifting moods are not a sign of instability. On the contrary, they demonstrate your emotional strength which allows your feelings to flow in their naturally fluid manner. Ultimately, establishing equilibrium is important too, since you don't want to get washed away with the tides. Paradoxically, your smartest strategy is to hold onto the present moment while letting go of the past."
leo,2014-10-30,"Current realizations are opening new doorways in your quest for love and intimacy. But these epiphanies might not make getting along with others any easier because you can suddenly recognize how much you stand in your own way. Thankfully, you have a big heart and have much to give to those you admire. By taking the time now to carefully reassess the part you play in the emotional dynamics, you could make long-lasting improvements to your most significant relationships."
virgo,2014-10-30,"There's an uncharacteristic rigidity to your decisions today. Usually, your mental adaptability enables you to incorporate new information and revise your choices accordingly. However, your solutions may be based upon what you don't know -- and what you don't know now can be problematic down the road. Reserve your final answers until you're completely satisfied that you have all the facts you need. Better safe than sorry."
libra,2014-10-30,"You may find yourself in a rather uncomfortable position, but your current predicament is not just about today. Even if the stress in your social life has been unfolding for a while, an ongoing disagreement can come to a boiling point now as you realize there might not be an easy way out. However, the real solution isn't about finding a quick fix; a premature resolution will just stop the process. Instead, get in touch with your own sense of vulnerability. You'll come out the other side feeling stronger for what you experienced and wiser for what you learned."
scorpio,2014-10-30,"You may be a bit disconnected from your innermost feelings today, but oddly enough, you're not uncomfortable with this emotional displacement. Think of it as a little vacation from your own high-intensity passions. You haven't lost anything; whatever you're not integrating now will cycle around soon enough. There's no need to panic; just sit back, relax and count your blessings. Enjoy the drama-free zone while it lasts."
sagittarius,2014-10-30,"Although you could be more serious in your overall approach to life now, you still have much to learn from your current feelings. Keep all avenues of communication open to avert your current tendency to remain silent about whatever is bothering you. You don't need to go to a therapist to experience the benefit of talk therapy. Sharing your most significant hopes and dreams with your friends and family helps you more than you can imagine."
capricorn,2014-10-30,"Your physical energy is easily depleted today, especially if you aren't taking proper care of yourself. Current stresses are building to a crescendo now as your head argues with your heart. But don't try to force your emotions into submission with logical calculations. Instead of demonstrating your mastery by figuring out your best move, postpone any major decisions until you get some much-needed rest. Once the bounce is back in your step, you will be better equipped to handle any challenge that comes your way."
aquarius,2014-10-30,"You might think that hiding your feelings is in your best interest today, but flashing a smile while keeping a stiff upper lip only throws the dynamics further off kilter. It may be inconvenient to share your personal needs on the job, especially if they differ from your professional obligations. Nevertheless, your integrity is at stake so start talking now. Fortunately, you can turn your current stress to your advantage by openly acknowledging your predicament and thanking the other person for listening. Then return to the work at hand with your best foot forward and a lighter heart."
pisces,2014-10-30,"Irrepressible issues from your past are here for one more round of processing prior to fading away for good. This emotional work may not be easy stuff to handle since it's certainly not fun to talk about subjects that make you feel uncomfortable. Nevertheless, face your own shortcomings, look at your own fears and learn from your past mistakes. Things are not nearly as overwhelming as they seem; getting started is the hardest part."
aries,2014-10-31,"Push your thinking around the corner of convenience and into the neighborhood of excitement. Even if there isn't a significant social component to your day, it's essential to give yourself the time and space to dream. But this isn't about sleeping the day away; it's about manifesting the greatest potential in your life. Hang out with friends who encourage your growth while you explore all the possibilities within your imagination."
taurus,2014-10-31,"Step beyond your own personal needs today by jumping in and helping someone take care of a larger set of concerns. Nevertheless, you still want to discuss your long-term career objectives with like-minded friends. But be careful not to slip into denial because you might try to use global thinking to avoid the weight of the responsibilities on your shoulders. Escape isn't an option, even if it sounds like a good idea at first. Balance your obligations with altruistic behavior for the good of all."
gemini,2014-10-31,"Your nervous system is working overtime today if you're pulled into a situation that is beyond your control. For that matter, the current circumstances might also be beyond your understanding. Don't spin your mental wheels too hard or too fast; logic won't beat a path to happiness now. There's no reason to fight what you cannot change. Accept the situation for what it is and proceed from there. You will never know what adventure is waiting around the bend unless you move on."
cancer,2014-10-31,"You might feel somewhat out of sorts today if you attempt to use analytical tools to untangle a thorny issue. Unfortunately, this rational approach may not serve you very well. It should come as no surprise that the best way to deal with emotional problems is to bring them out into the open. Although a solution could remain elusive now, your attitude will improve once you know that you shared your truth and your message was clearly received."
leo,2014-10-31,"It may be upsetting if a friend doesn't rush to offer a helping hand today, but don't assume the worst if the support you want isn't forthcoming. Your needs might not be as clear to others as you think. In fact, a simple misunderstanding could escalate into a hotbed of conflict. Instead of  stirring up more trouble, try to let the energy settle down. But avoiding your feelings is only a temporary solution to the current imbalance. You  need to figure things out on your own for a while without expecting anyone to come to your rescue."
virgo,2014-10-31,"You are usually the champion of analyzing situations and discerning what is most important. But not today. Your key planet Mercury crosses paths with nebulous Neptune, making it nearly impossible to see the forest for the trees. You might not even be able to distinguish a single tree through the mists of your own illusions. Practicing patience could be your perfect answer; the fog will lift and clarity will return before you know it."
libra,2014-10-31,"Your creativity could soar to new heights today, but you must get past your own sense of inadequacy first. Self-imposed restrictions may stem from some previous hurt or painful experience from your ancient past. The most important thing is to understand the difference between then and now. Stop listening to old messages if you want to reach your potential.  Let your inner artist out to play because your self-esteem is now directly linked to your need for self-expression."
scorpio,2014-10-31,"Unexpected tension arises today from your own lack of certainty about your feelings. This confusion isn't your usual state of affairs, since you normally don't have any problem holding a distinct point of view. However, your perspective is clouded by your own fears now. There's no time to waste; move past your current ambivalence by sailing straight into the mists of your illusions. Direct confrontation with your inner demons is the fastest way to eliminate them."
sagittarius,2014-10-31,"It's up to you to ascribe meaning to the variety of images that pop into your imagination today. The best way to work with this stream of information is to simply allow your fantasies to flow into awareness without judgment. There's no reason to hold back; let both the positive and negative thoughts rise to the surface. You can always pick and choose which ones you want to focus on later. For now, surf the energy without making any long-lasting waves."
capricorn,2014-10-31,"Memories that hearken back to long-forgotten failures, physical pains or emotional hurts could resurface today. But now your maturity enables you to see these old experiences in a brand new light. And that is exactly what you should be doing. The best reason to revisit the past now is to free yourself from it once and for all. Your future is calling and there is little time to waste."
aquarius,2014-10-31,"You may be offered another chance to manifest a dream -- or at least that's how it seems today. The time to hesitate is through. Grab the opportunity that's right in front of your nose; you've earned it. It doesn't matter that everything isn't exactly the way you imagined it; don't give up when you are so close to your goal. Take a leap of faith and see what happens. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
pisces,2014-10-31,"Whatever certainty you recently experienced has now disappeared into the elusive Neptunian mists. This temporary shift would overwhelm anyone else, but not so for you Fish. These dreamy realms are your native terrain and you are quite comfortable swimming in murky waters. When reality fuzzes out and facts become less clear, you shift into overdrive. Your intuition and imagination are connected with the entire cosmos -- whether you can see it or not."
aries,2014-11-01,"Hiding from the world sounds like a good idea today, but it's not possible if others are demanding all of your time. You can't ignore your commitments, so the sooner you push through your resistance the better. You are an integral part of a community and your lack of participation could send the wrong message now. Showing up as a team player doesn't mean you have to run the entire show. Luckily, you can still enjoy yourself by hanging back and letting someone else lead the charge."
taurus,2014-11-01,"Your idealistic visions about your future are so compelling now that you may want to share them with others. However, it's advantageous to wait until you have more clarity prior to cluing someone else in on your plans. It's more important to continue cultivating your thoughts on your own than it is to attract attention. Flying beneath the radar is a wise strategy today. Have patience; successful ideas take time to evolve and grow into their full potential."
gemini,2014-11-01,"You have big plans today and won't let anyone's negativity slow you down. However, you might be so stoked about your future that you only see what you want to see. Your positive attitude improves your chances for success, but only if you're not in denial. Don't surround yourself with people who simply agree with you no matter what. It's better to know the truth even if it hurts. Nearly anything is possible as long as you can discern the difference between fact and fiction."
cancer,2014-11-01,"You may be overly confident about an important decision today, but your choices could steer you wrong unless you take all of the facts into consideration. Paying careful attention to what others expect prevents you from taking things too far. In the end, listening to your intuition is the deciding factor; just be sure to create enough peace and quiet in your life so you can get in touch with your inner wisdom."
leo,2014-11-01,"You're jazzed about stepping outside of your normal routine today and networking with friends who expand your horizons. But you're not focused solely on business now; you're more interested in deepening a special relationship than you are with following a professional lead. Even if you have chores that must be completed, don't pass up a chance to pursue matters of the heart. It's not necessary to have all the answers now; simply revealing your vulnerability can be the primary key that opens the door to the next level of intimacy."
virgo,2014-11-01,Don't lose touch with your own needs today because the Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Partners can shift your attention from your own personal issues to what's happening with those closest to you. Juggling your personal desires with your familial and social commitments takes extra finesse now. Maintaining a healthy balance is a prerequisite to successfully navigating your way through the tricky terrain of relationships. No one expects perfection as long as your intentions are sincere.
libra,2014-11-01,"Your enthusiasm continues to inspire you today even if you're feeling overwhelmed by a situation that isn't unfolding according to your plans. Unfortunately, your current tendency to gloss over important details can impede your progress. Nevertheless, it's still tough for changing circumstances to pull you off course if you remain committed to fulfilling your obligations now. As your thoughts drift away from reality and into the realms of possibility, gently guide them back into the present moment for the sake of clarity and peace of mind."
scorpio,2014-11-01,"You're eager to fulfill your promises today, and you can even enjoy yourself while still being super-productive. However, you may struggle trying to adhere to an overly rigid schedule as you desire to be free from restrictions. Nevertheless, it's smarter to buckle down and finish your chores before complicating your day with more distractions. Not only will you feel proud of your accomplishments, you will also be available for whatever comes next."
sagittarius,2014-11-01,"Your good intentions may not be enough to keep you on the straight and narrow path today as you play out your wanderlust in the realm of fantasies. Thankfully, you have the wisdom to hide your imaginative exploits so no one realizes that you have left the building and are traveling somewhere else in your mind. But don't get cocky or you could have to answer to an unforgiving friend, boss or lover. If you maintain appearances, you just might get away with keeping one foot in each world for a little while longer."
capricorn,2014-11-01,"You're often a person that everyone confides in because you seem capable of holding space for their problems. But people might not even realize that you're going through your own personal struggles now as you attempt to balance your appearance of competence with your increasing lack of certainty. It's useful to reconsider your assumptions today, but don't let questioning turn into self-doubt. Save the philosophical contemplation for another day when you have more time on your hands."
aquarius,2014-11-01,"Your dreams may bring an answer to a stubborn question now, but you must be willing to take sufficient time to explore their symbolism. Even if you're unable to recall specific details, your subconscious mind connects you with what's most relevant. The good news is that your unbridled imagination helps you to co-create the future. Remember, tomorrow's reality begins with today's thought."
pisces,2014-11-01,"You know how critical it is to separate your feelings from the empathic connection you have with others, but this intuitive process requires constant vigilance. The Moon's visit to your compassionate sign increases your sensitivity and makes it easier to respond to what's happening without becoming exhausted or emotionally drained. However, differentiating your thoughts from those around you is tricky business, so it might be a lot more pleasurable to indulge your dreams while you can."
aries,2014-11-02,"You are motivated to reconnect with your desires and act from the heart today, whatever the social cost. But you might discover you're too close to the edge when you find yourself flirting with the limits of acceptability. It could be frustrating if you can't execute your plan the way you've envisioned it. Don't sacrifice your authenticity, for your integrity is more important in the long run than anything else."
taurus,2014-11-02,"You might eagerly anticipate taking some time off, but you already have too much going on to walk away from your responsibilities. It's more complicated to find peace of mind today as your key planet Venus moves toward a tricky alignment. But quiet contemplation sounds better than it actually is, so stop resisting the inevitable and activate your senses instead of trying to subdue them. Embracing the unknown may be more fun than you expect."
gemini,2014-11-02,Trying to prevent your mind from playing out every possible scenario may be an act of futility now because your thoughts are wired and your ideas are crackling with anticipation. But anxiety could set in when you realize that your intellectual meanderings won't bring you any closer to happiness. Your best bet is to push past any ambivalence you might be feeling today and pick a course of action without getting too attached to the outcome. Make a choice and let destiny take it from there.
cancer,2014-11-02,"Your ideas for the future may be more like flights of fancy today than concrete plans. However, your optimism is off the charts, inspiring you to share your thoughts with others. You might be unhappily surprised when they don't exude the same enthusiasm, possibly leaving you in an agitated frame of mind. But don't pin all your hopes on anyone else's approval. Stir up some energy on your own. Something as simple as getting outside for a walk can be just the catalyst you need to help you push past your current emotional angst."
leo,2014-11-02,"At first, you might not like how events are turning out today yet your choices may seem extremely limited. Thankfully, you can still find ways to enjoy yourself, but you must be willing to let go of your fixed expectations. Don't waste your day looking for some mysterious secret ingredient in your recipe for a perfect experience. Instead, accept the magic of the present moment as it exists now; there is joy to be found wherever you look."
virgo,2014-11-02,"You have the power of persuasion on your side today and could rationalize almost anything you desire. You may brag that you can climb any wall placed in front of you, yet caution is heartily advised. It's not that you're mistaken in your judgment; it's just that it might be hard to find a workable balance between your logic and your emotions now. Tread lightly and don't make any promises you can't keep. You are free to imagine what's possible if you don't forget your innate sense of practicality in the process."
libra,2014-11-02,"Although you might feel like making a quick escape today, your restlessness doesn't have to ruin your day. Even if you want to pull into your shell, pushy Mars won't leave you alone now as he insists you mix and mingle with others. Start a project that requires physical activity to drain off some of your excess frustration. You may be surprised with how much you enjoy social interactions once you feel more grounded."
scorpio,2014-11-02,"Managing your emotional energy today is no simple matter as your co-ruling planet Mars shifts into high gear. Unfortunately, it might feel like you're driving uphill on an icy road. Gaining traction is hard work now, even if it's easy to visualize success. Don't struggle; if you aren't making progress, relax and just try again later when the conditions are more suited for reaching your destination. Recharge your batteries while you have the chance."
sagittarius,2014-11-02,"You might be hooked by a strong emotion that just won't go away. Your thoughts are not completely under your control today and the more you attempt to squelch a desire, the stronger it gets. Don't fight it; even if your head and heart are at odds, the stress will settle down on its own if you stay in touch with your inner process. Take a deep breath and keep reminding yourself that you don't have to act on every passing whim."
capricorn,2014-11-02,"Although you may be lost in dreams about your future, events of the day repeatedly pull you back to the present. You could grow annoyed with the inescapable sense of urgency that pervades your life now. You are driven to initiate action right away, but a sensible solution remains just out of reach. Thankfully, you can remove the pressure by delaying major decisions until the time feels right."
aquarius,2014-11-02,"Your role outside of the home and family could distract you from personal matters today. However, your problems won't magically disappear until you finally face them once and for all. Your attitude may improve if you focus your attention elsewhere for a while, rather than on your own issues. Fortunately, your heightened creativity can impress others and help them in ways you don't even expect."
pisces,2014-11-02,"You grow excited when you realize your fantasies have a solid chance of manifesting in a very tangible manner. In your perfect world, all dreams would come true on a regular basis. However, you may be over-analyzing everything now to avoid getting swept up in an illusion. Logic can help you stay grounded today, but it won't give you your final answer. You Fish know better than anyone that you can trust your intuition to guide you in the right direction."
aries,2014-11-03,"Your enthusiasm can burn away the cobwebs and clear the debris from your path today, but that doesn't mean you'll reach your destination easily. The Moon's return to your sign may have you riding waves of self-expression, but social etiquette could prevent you from acting on your desires. There are cosmic forces at work that might complicate your progress. Don't let the uneven pace discourage you; practicing perseverance now will be rewarded in the long run."
taurus,2014-11-03,Conflicting signals from the cosmos stir up a storm of confusion today as romantic Venus runs into non-conformist Uranus. It appears that doors are opening and you should be able to walk right through them. But something isn't quite right and your intuition is telling you to stay where you are now. Don't be so quick to push for something more; happiness may be closer than you realize if you remain open to the element of surprise.
gemini,2014-11-03,"Flitting about like a social butterfly may be your idea of fun today, but the cost of ignoring your job could be greater than you think. Unfortunately, you might not make the wisest decisions now unless you stop to consider how your behavior might affect others. However, keeping one eye on the horizon enables you to make better choices. The good news is that you can quickly shift gears and change direction once you see the truth. With a bit of conscious intention it's possible to make the most of every moment."
cancer,2014-11-03,"Being the center of attention at work can be nerve-wracking, but there isn't any real danger of getting stuck in the spotlight for long. Instead of trying to slink away unseen today, bask in the accolades that are bestowed on you while you can. This is an excellent opportunity to be appreciated for the nurturing you provide others."
leo,2014-11-03,"You are singularly focused on planning your next big adventure, and the truth is that your wishes might manifest in ways you don't expect. But success remains elusive unless you're willing to tend to every little detail. Unfortunately, this prerequisite could be problematic today, for you're not in the mood to deal with minor matters. Nevertheless, put those blinders on and do what is necessary so you can make your dreams come true."
virgo,2014-11-03,"You may be yearning for a radical new experience that can teach you something valuable about your feelings. Normally, you prefer to shy away from the very same intensity that is now luring you into deeper emotional waters. Set aside any negativity that could stand in your way today; be courageous, for your willingness to be vulnerable demonstrates your capacity to grow."
libra,2014-11-03,"You might be afraid to trust others today because they don't seem to share your core values. In fact, your coworkers could distract you from your real work. Nevertheless, you're still intrigued by the possibility of having fun even if you wish the noise would settle down. Trying to control all the variables is a waste of time, since rigid behavior will likely bring frustration instead of productivity. It's possible to engage in meaningful interactions by practicing flexibility without compromising your integrity."
scorpio,2014-11-03,"Finding new ways to do the same old thing can bring deep satisfaction today since you have grown weary with your daily routines. You may be nearing the end of a familiar road now, but it's essential that you don't push for change prematurely. Don't let discouragement fester just because progress is taking longer than you wish. Continue to work on your own inner transformation and let the process unfold naturally."
sagittarius,2014-11-03,"Keeping your desires to yourself seems like a wise choice today if your feelings are drawing you into unconventional territory. However, completely suppressing a craving might actually strengthen it instead of making it go away. Your smartest strategy may be to hold your emotions close to your chest while exploring them in your fantasies. When you are ready, sharing your yearning with a trusted friend might bring you the objective perspective you need to let it go and move on."
capricorn,2014-11-03,"It's wise to think twice before acting recklessly. Thankfully, this doesn't mean you have to forego your spark of originality. Consider the consequences first, but if your idea survives your precursory analysis, take a chance and be a bit more daring than usual. You can cover more ground as long as you have honorable intentions and a map to your destination."
aquarius,2014-11-03,Don't waste your precious time or energy by getting bent out of shape if someone disagrees with you today. Taking interpersonal dynamics in stride can magically transform the most challenging situation into a memorable event. Focus specifically on your actions instead of other people's judgments. Adopting an innovative approach to relationships is a safe bet while the planets are smiling favorably on you.
pisces,2014-11-03,"You may have to push past your initial discomfort today, especially if you are stuck in a cloud of self-doubt. Whatever challenges you face could seem overwhelming now, but your best move is to jump right into the thick of it without any hesitation. Remember, the first step is the hardest one. Once you gain the necessary momentum, your confidence will return and your goals will seem closer than ever."
aries,2014-11-04,"Your emotions may be overwhelming now that the Moon is hooking up with crazy Uranus in your sign. Even if it sounds impossible, you want to experience the intensity of passion while simultaneously keeping your cool. Unfortunately, you can't play it both ways, even if you're afraid of what you must give up if you choose one over the other. Logic only takes you so far today, but trusting your instincts could put you in touch with what matters most."
taurus,2014-11-04,"You have high hopes that a romantic relationship will thrive, even if you must confront a familiar issue you prefer to avoid. You intuitively know you can't bury your head in the sand any longer, although you wish you could take the easy way out. Fortunately, facing your fears today isn't as challenging as you expected. The truth is it's much more complicated to pretend that everything is fine when it's not. Seeing things in their true light is the first step toward creating positive change."
gemini,2014-11-04,"You can sense a shift in the cosmic weather today as the winds of change chase the lingering clouds of illusion from your inner skies. You are ready to get to the bottom of something that continues to bother you, but the answers you receive now won't likely be the ones you expect. Don't be shocked by what you discover. Although persistence doesn't come naturally, your perseverance will be rewarded in the end."
cancer,2014-11-04,"Someone's compelling confession might inspire you to share more than you planned today, even if you know that you should say less. Unfortunately, once you open your mouth and begin talking, closing it becomes much more difficult. It's helpful to remind yourself throughout the day that you don't have to tell your whole life story all at once. A healthy dose of discretion will get you further than speaking too soon. You can still be a compassionate listener without saying a word."
leo,2014-11-04,"It's time to release painful old memories so you can open your heart to the joy that is now finding its way into your life. However, getting past an emotional block doesn't mean you should just forget about your previous experiences. Denying your feelings is not a sensible strategy because you might end up being irritated without an obvious reason. Thankfully, your flexible attitude could lead to an exciting breakthrough that sends you off in an entirely new direction."
virgo,2014-11-04,"You may try to deepen a business or personal relationship now, but could encounter an unexpected response from the other person. Even if you are open to surprises, it's challenging when things don't fit into a neat and tidy package. Fortunately, this obstacle doesn't have to become a problem unless you choose to make it one. You're at the start of something new, so let the energy flow naturally instead of demanding that the tides should follow your schedule."
libra,2014-11-04,"You are tempted to withdraw to protect your heart now, but this cautious strategy only increases your sense of isolation. The Moon's current visit to your 7th House of Partnerships raises the level of stress in relationships, especially if someone seems overly pushy today. Instead of shutting others out, take the time to understand their perspectives. Once you can see things through someone else's eyes, you are in a better position to establish common ground and feel more connected with those you love."
scorpio,2014-11-04,"You have little interest in escalating a conflict now; you just want to get to the source of your anger so you can process your feelings and move on. However, the combative Aries Moon dynamically squares your key planet Pluto today, agitating emotions that could suddenly erupt. Fortunately, you are motivated to take proactive steps once you realize that clinging to the past will only bring you unhappiness. There's a bright future beckoning just around the bend if you have the courage to let go and follow your heart."
sagittarius,2014-11-04,"Following someone else's directions is out of the question today. No matter how crazy your idea is, you want the opportunity to give it a spin. However, success is not your primary goal now; your joy comes from the simple act of creative self-expression. The radical Moon-Uranus hook-up in your 5th House of Spontaneity prompts you to take action without concern for the consequences. Nevertheless, it's worth the risk since you might just make an ingenious discovery."
capricorn,2014-11-04,"You're not ready for how quickly things shift now that the evocative Moon aligns with unpredictable Uranus. You have to decide how you're going to manage the energy; either choose to let the pressure get the best of you or consciously accept what you cannot change. Don't expect a miracle, but remember that your positive attitude and your willingness to adapt to any situation can turn a stressful day into a positive one."
aquarius,2014-11-04,"Although you assume you have everything under control, something momentous happens today that forces you to see your world differently. Instead of trying to stick to your busy schedule, it may be more sensible to just let it fall apart and then piece it back together after the chaos clears. It's too late for preventive medicine now; just prepare for change and let the chips fall where they may."
pisces,2014-11-04,It seems as if you're being dragged into the future against your will by unseen forces. It's not that you're resistant to progress in theory; it's just that you have grown comfortable with the status quo and you're not yet ready for it to slip into the past. Keep in mind that your fear of what's coming next may be more problematic than the actual challenges you will encounter. Don't worry about the unknown; there's nothing you can do about it until you have more information at your disposal.
aries,2014-11-05,"Although this may be another hectic day, you might just appreciate the rapid pace at which it unfolds. The spontaneous Aries Moon is hot to trot, pumping adrenaline into your system. But rather than attempting to harness the energy for your own benefit, let it flow without trying to control its direction. An ingenious solution to a long-term problem could suddenly shock you with its simplicity. The less you resist change, the more you can enjoy the day."
taurus,2014-11-05,"You might remember back when your life was very simple, but today you can't be certain that your recollections are real. You're attracted to a memory based on the way you wish things were rather than how they actually are now. Nevertheless, you feel very passionately about your convictions. Forget about minimizing complications; think big with respect to relationship issues; the Moon's return to sensible Taurus this afternoon will help to keep you on track."
gemini,2014-11-05,"Your emotions are quite visceral now, and your thoughts are moving so quickly that it's easy to forget about maintaining healthy habits. Still, it's rather annoying if you have to slow down to feel what's happening in your body. Don't try to avoid physical sensations, even if they are not all pleasurable today. Just remember to follow up by improving your lifestyle in small ways instead of trying to change everything at once."
cancer,2014-11-05,"Although this may not be the most ideal day to stay at home, it can work out in your favor if you don't go burying your feelings like a dog with its bone. Even if you can't find any downtime until the evening, the richness of your emotions makes this day special; don't hesitate to wear your heart on your sleeve. Keeping your needs to yourself might increase your temporary sense of security, but expressing your truth is a courageous strategy that leads to personal growth and lasting intimacy."
leo,2014-11-05,"Considering all of your different possibilities could be your favorite theme for the day, but the real payoff is not readily apparent. It's challenging to contemplate your feelings that lurk just beneath the surface, yet meditating on the unknown can be its own reward today. Instead of thinking about tangible matters, concentrate on the magic that happens when you quiet your mind. You don't need to be productive now if you can find a creative way to inspire others."
virgo,2014-11-05,"You can feel the tension today if logic isn't leading you to the right conclusions. It's like you're picking up a faint radio signal that's usually out of listening range. No matter how hard you try, you can't tune out this station -- and that's what makes you uneasy. Rather than resisting the message, remain open to what you hear; it may end up being much more informative than you ever imagined. Sometimes, there's no substitute for taking a leap of faith."
libra,2014-11-05,"You are quite adept at making adjustments to your own feelings in order to keep things running smoothly in your world. Today is one of those days when you might feel vulnerable when sharing your ideas. Thankfully it's not a big deal -- and definitely not a life-changer. However, one quick fix won't do the trick; make several subtle realignments throughout the day as required."
scorpio,2014-11-05,"There are powerful forces pulling you in opposite directions today. One is calling you into the realm of imagination, inspiring you to dream the day away. However, the other one is demanding that you handle pressing issues in your everyday life. Allowing room for both worlds to coexist is your only viable plan; the good news is that they are not as incompatible as they seem at first."
sagittarius,2014-11-05,"You have a wealth of powerful images at your disposal today, if only you can untangle reality from your dreams. It may seem as if communication is garbled, yet the lack of clarity doesn't need to bring you down. Keep returning to your imagination for inspiration, even if your visions don't make sense yet. Your subconscious has an important story to tell now if only you take the necessary time to listen."
capricorn,2014-11-05,"You Mountain Goats have the reputation of being among the most reliable signs in the zodiac. However, you may feel less responsible than usual today, especially if you are distracted by your daydreams. An impractical opportunity might come your way, and thankfully, there's no harm in letting your imagination run wild. You don't have to actually do anything right away as long as you indulge in the fantasy. Just remember, if you can imagine something, you can also make it real."
aquarius,2014-11-05,"You may not feel like living up to your responsibilities today; however, ignoring them is not a sensible strategy, either. This is a great day to get lots of things done, even if you would prefer to take the day off. However, before you start anything, think about how much you will be able to accomplish if you don't expend too much energy on simple tasks. Your objective assessment of the job is nearly as important as doing the work."
pisces,2014-11-05,"Obtaining your goals is possible today if you stop to consider what resources are required before you even start. Although you might believe it's going to be a productive day, nothing happens as fast as you expect. If you try too hard, you might end up frustrated because you don't accomplish enough. It's tempting to escape into your dreamy illusions, but you could take your fantasies too far. Balancing your wishes with a pinch of reality along the way prevents you from falling victim to your own sense of perfection."
aries,2014-11-06,"Your drive to experience pleasure could make you feel unproductive, especially if you think that your fantasies are out of reach. Although you might be content with letting a few dreams pass you by today, it's apparent that your window of opportunity is closing fast. Apply the powerful light of the Taurus Full Moon in your 2nd House of Values to pursue satisfaction without sacrificing your sense of what is important. Whatever you do, don't become too complacent. Make your work count while the odds are still in your favor."
taurus,2014-11-06,"You Bulls prefer standing on stable turf and being absolutely sure about your destination, but you're willing to tolerate a bit more uncertainty now. Today's Full Moon in your sensual sign puts you directly in touch with your feelings as they tug at you from different directions. Fortunately, you have a strong craving for excitement now and plenty of energy to expend. Even with the current emotional turmoil, you can still rely on your inner compass to guide you through the day. Trust your intuition to find your way back to solid ground."
gemini,2014-11-06,"Everything feels less complicated than it actually is today, but you may not notice the emotional subtleties that are hiding beneath the surface. The placid Taurus Full Moon falls in your 12th House of Privacy, reminding you to keep your concerns quiet. Thankfully, you're able to successfully navigate the tricky cosmic currents. Remember, your goal is to maintain balance now, rather than to reach a specific destination; flying beneath the radar is your secret weapon."
cancer,2014-11-06,"Your friends and colleagues may be annoying you today by persistently coaxing you to step outside of your comfort zone. Even if you resist at first, the Taurus Full Moon shining in your 11th House of Teamwork convinces you to relinquish control to the greater tides of change. Once you accept that you can't prevent the inevitable from happening, your worries can transform into exhilaration. Removing the barriers between you and the rest of the group enables you to confidently move into the future."
leo,2014-11-06,"You want to squeeze every last drop of excitement out of your busy schedule today. However, you can be too stubborn about adhering to your agenda while the bullheaded Taurus Full Moon illuminates your 10th House of Career. Unfortunately, circumstances will require you to change your plans a few more times yet. Thankfully, your tension may be alleviated by discussing your dilemma with someone you trust. Don't let pride stand in the way when flexibility could pave your way to success."
virgo,2014-11-06,"Someone may be withholding important information from you now, leaving you to make a commitment based on incomplete data. However, the Taurus Full Moon spotlights your 9th House of Big Ideas, encouraging you to forge ahead with your plans anyhow. Even if your strategy doesn't unfold according to your expectations, it's not wise to take your frustrations out on anyone else. Rather than concentrating on what goes wrong, save the day by focusing on the amazing possibilities that still lay ahead."
libra,2014-11-06,"It's not easy to remain calm today because a simple financial decision may escalate into a crisis that involves a close friend or business partner. But your attempt to fix the problem only makes matters worse as the Taurus Full Moon floods your 8th House of Shared Resources, requiring you to take responsibility for a choice that's not really yours to make. Fortunately, executing a strategy based on cooperation, rather than control, might be enough to restore the peace."
scorpio,2014-11-06,"Someone might approach you today with a magical formula for your happiness. Although the strategy sounds good in theory, it doesn't work for you in its present form. The Taurus Full Moon brightens your 7th House of Partners, pitting simplicity against complexity in your personal relationships. Instead of going out of your way to drive home your point, change your tactics and do whatever you can to get along with your peers. Appreciating the contributions of others gives you a good place to start on your way to discovering a solid solution."
sagittarius,2014-11-06,"The hectic pace of your day can wear you out with many demands at work requiring your immediate attention. However, reacting quickly isn't as useful as you think, since you could waste a lot of energy heading off in a wrong direction. The Taurus Full Moon activates your 6th House of Habits, reminding you to slow down and stay on track or you'll just end up spinning your wheels without much to show for your efforts. Taking the time to set clear priorities makes all the difference in the world."
capricorn,2014-11-06,"Misreading the dynamics on the job today can send you on an exhausting wild goose chase. But even if your plan is unsuccessful, try not to blame anyone else. The pragmatic Taurus Full Moon lights up your 5th House of Play, encouraging you to enjoy yourself even while pursuing your goals. An argument doesn't increase your productivity and only generates bad feelings. Taking the pressure off of others makes the best of a stressful situation. Whistle while you work."
aquarius,2014-11-06,"A conversation about your personal life might not go as smoothly as you prefer today. Although you may have specific goals in mind, it's not easy getting your needs out in the open with the lazy Taurus Full Moon hiding in your 4th House of Roots. Instead of obsessing over your feelings or nitpicking over unimportant details, do your best to find common ground. Collaborating with like-minded people can help you to accomplish a lot more now than acting like a lone ranger and striking out on your own."
pisces,2014-11-06,"Time appears to be running faster than ever, yet your wisest strategy now is to take several deep breaths and slow down. Today's pragmatic Taurus Full Moon highlights your 3rd House of Communication, infusing your words with common sense. Although an unexpected change of plans could be upsetting at first, hold onto your dreams for the best possible outcome. Your consistent affirmations go a long way toward uplifting your attitude and improving your day."
aries,2014-11-07,"You can spin all the wheels you want, but it still may not be enough if someone isn't willing to accept what you have to offer. In fact, you might even be the one who is harshly judging your own shortcomings. Fortunately, this cloud of negativity should pass quickly if you don't waste time trying to measure up to unrealistic expectations. A more sensible strategy is to focus on doing the best you can today without concern for anything else."
taurus,2014-11-07,"Although you mean no harm, it's easy to inadvertently encourage conflict by pushing someone's buttons today. You might not notice how moody you are with the Moon lingering in your sign but before you know it, you could be in the middle of an emotional tussle with anyone who stands in your way. Simply staying aware of your propensity toward rigidity may be enough to change the dynamics, allowing you to sidestep an unnecessary confrontation before it even occurs. Taking a proactive approach saves the day."
gemini,2014-11-07,"You love to flit from conversation to conversation, but your eagerness to communicate doesn't mean you are emotionally accessible. Bringing your feelings out into the open is an uphill battle today, but your dogged persistence makes a big difference. Unfortunately, your positive intentions are not enough now; the information you share could still be problematic for someone else. Express yourself as clearly as you can and then don't back down from the truth. Maintain your integrity at all costs."
cancer,2014-11-07,"A thought continues to gnaw at your attention until you finally acknowledge it and speak your piece. Although your feelings continue to grow stronger throughout the day, along with your need to express them, you're likely to reach a point where the window of opportunity closes. Be as open and forthright as you can right from the start. Your friends and associates will appreciate your honesty more than you know. Sharing your heart inspires others to do the same."
leo,2014-11-07,"Your emotional dependability plays a crucial role as you continue along your professional path today. Fortunately, you derive power from the strength of your convictions, enabling you to provide a steady shoulder to support those who might need one. Everyone appears to be making demands as you try to cover as much ground as you can. But don't give out all your energy without receiving something in return. Generosity of spirit is best when shared all the way around."
virgo,2014-11-07,"Your fantasies can seem so real today that you actually believe them, even if choose to leave them unfulfilled. It's not that it's impossible to manifest your dreams; it's just that you could be scared to take a risk that puts so much on the line. Nevertheless, don't hold back now when making plans; aim high for you will never know what's possible unless you try."
libra,2014-11-07,"Look right past any uncertainty today if self-doubt creeps into your emotional mix. Focus on your long-term goals, especially if you receive mixed signals from the Moon once she flies into fickle Gemini. You know that your ideas are sound and your enthusiasm is irrepressible. However, you may underestimate how much work you have in front of you. You will be more successful if you remember to consistently moderate the extremes. Ultimately, finding a workable balance is your key to success."
scorpio,2014-11-07,"A minor disagreement could turn into a major confrontation today due to someone's unwillingness to compromise. Ironically, you can't help but respect a person who takes a stand for his or her beliefs. Don't waste your energy trying to change anyone else's mind because you could exhaust yourself in the process. It's possible for opposing perspectives to be valid; just honor the current differences of opinion and politely agree to disagree."
sagittarius,2014-11-07,"There is a definite shift in relationship dynamics today, even if you believe the energy has grown stagnant. At first you might think that everything is up for grabs, but when you make your move you quickly discover that your efforts were for naught. Nevertheless, your persistence will be rewarded. Be ready to take advantage of an opportunity if it appears now, but don't push too hard. Haste makes waste; applying gentle pressure over a longer period of time should do the trick."
capricorn,2014-11-07,"You normally have a no-nonsense approach to relationships and prefer to make your choices based on practical considerations. You don't appreciate someone's heavy-handed manner of asking for help today. You're tempted to lash out and set the record straight. But instead of tackling this potential conflict head-on now, it will be much easier to handle later in the day once you have a more grounded perspective. Ultimately, your moral compass is a guide for everyone involved."
aquarius,2014-11-07,"You prefer to keep your feelings private today, but you may eventually be persuaded into making them known. Expressing your pent-up frustrations adds to your problems at first. However, your honest disclosure deepens your relationships in the long run. Pushing through your fears of being judged takes extra effort on your part, but staying true to yourself is your only sensible choice. Do whatever you must to get the ball rolling; starting the conversation is the hardest part."
pisces,2014-11-07,"You're tempted to stick with your old goals, even if you are beginning to doubt that they still serve you any longer. Unfortunately, it's difficult to pinpoint the source of your current dissatisfaction, yet uncertainty about your future continues to grow. Instead of trying to follow your preconceived agenda, set aside your previous strategy and just see where the present dynamics take you. Consciously avoiding struggle today allows you to set a new course tomorrow."
aries,2014-11-08,"Strong feelings create an undertow of tension now, setting into motion a sequence of events that pulls you off your desired course. If your day doesn't unfold as planned, there may be little you can do to make it go your way. No matter how many times you fix things, more problems keep popping up. Nevertheless, it's still wise to go through the motions to demonstrate your commitment to your path. Believe it or not, today's obstacles will likely be fading into the past by tomorrow."
taurus,2014-11-08,"You may claim that you're being flexible but your negotiations could run into trouble today when someone pushes you too far. Luckily, a vigorous discussion will likely lead to mutual satisfaction, unless you give up and retreat before everyone has their say. Be prepared to try one or two tactics that aren't successful before working through the current dilemma. Have faith; you have to struggle through the eye of a needle before you break through to the other side."
gemini,2014-11-08,"Your not usually interested in hanging out in the dark corners of your subconscious mind. However, you are now being inexplicably lured into exploring heavier emotions. Nevertheless, your ambivalence about heading into uncomfortable territory can have you pushing on the brakes while simultaneously stepping on the gas pedal. Consciously find a sustainable driving speed that works without necessarily overreacting one way or the other. Use your natural curiosity to discover the treasures hidden in the shadows."
cancer,2014-11-08,"You may initiate evasive tactics today in an attempt to avoid sinking deeper into your watery world of feelings and your attachments to the past. However, you still have much to learn from your emotions and need to discover new ways in which they can connect you to what's most important in your life. There's nothing wrong with coming up for air as long as you're committed to sticking with the process of doing your inner work. A temporary reprieve may be all you need to continue your journey with a more positive attitude."
leo,2014-11-08,"If you take on too much domestic responsibility now, your obligations can tie you up into tight emotional knots. It might feel as if you have no easy path to transform the situation from what it is to what you want it to be. But the answer is closer than you realize; even if you can't find the proper course right away, rest assured that it will come to you. If not today, then tomorrow. If not this week, then next week. Practicing patience all but ensures your success."
virgo,2014-11-08,"You have a clearer picture of your future now than you have had in the past, but this clarity doesn't necessarily reveal a quick way out of your present dilemma. In fact, your current frustration may stem from restrictions you face that involve coordinating someone else's schedule with your own. Fortunately, your plan is supported by the strength of your convictions, so keep your end goal in sight at all times. Others will come around to join your cause when they see your unwavering commitment to success."
libra,2014-11-08,"You may be struggling with someone who is discouraging you from following your heart. However, a person who is standing in your way now might unwittingly be acting out your own concerns about your current path. Instead of expressing your anger at an external target, acknowledge your uncertainty. Once you're being honest about your self-doubt, others will offer you support rather than disapproval."
scorpio,2014-11-08,"You are growing more self-sufficient in your thinking as you develop a new sense of purpose. As much as you might want to hold onto what you had in the past, your current explorations are leading you into uncharted territory. Your thoughts are undergoing a profound metamorphosis now that mental Mercury is traveling through your sign. Remember, today's challenges are simply preparation for the opportunities coming just around the corner."
sagittarius,2014-11-08,"So much of your inner process is currently hidden from the view of those around you. You can't help but secretly enjoy the complex fantasy worlds surfacing from the depths of your own subconscious mind. However, you are less concerned with the works of your imagination now than you are with bringing happiness and joy into the world. The good news is your positive outlook is contagious. Think globally, but act locally; spreading good will starts at home."
capricorn,2014-11-08,"If one of your friends comes to you with a proposition, you may have to kindly tell him or her that you're simply not interested. Your response might feel harsh as you say it, but it is what you believe and it must be said. Even if you have to deal with someone's anger or disappointment, you cannot sacrifice your own integrity just to please someone else. All you can do is listen and respond with the truth as you see it."
aquarius,2014-11-08,"You could be going through all the correct motions now, yet you still feel as if your progress is being thwarted. It's as if someone is working against you, yet you're not sure why. Paradoxically, you might be trying so hard to impress others that you come across colder and more calculating than you actually are. There's no need to hide your feelings, even if you don't want anyone to know about your personal struggles. Surprisingly, the resistance may fade quicker than you expect once you reveal your vulnerability."
pisces,2014-11-08,"You can see all kinds of possibilities developing out on the horizon and you're eager to move from the present into the future. Life has the potential of turning into a giant adventure, and you're ready to start the next leg of the journey. However, something is still obstructing your path and preventing your departure. The current delay is not a sign that you're choosing the wrong direction; it's just the universe's way of showing you where work is needed before you head out. If you are willing to improve your game, you'll be on your way before you know it."
aries,2014-11-09,"Today is your day to cultivate a potential romance or strengthen your current one as your feelings are illuminated by your words. Your fantasy life is rich now, which in turn can fuel the fires of romance. However, it all comes back to one critical realization: how you feel about yourself directly influences how you relate to others. This is not about bravado; it's about your sense of mental and emotional reality. Don't hold back; although you may take pride in your independence, life is often better when shared."
taurus,2014-11-09,"There are two voices talking to you today. One is encouraging you to dance, to step out beyond your established boundaries and connect with others. Meanwhile, the contrasting voice is telling you not to make any sudden moves and to retreat into your own internal fantasy world where it is safe, even if it's lonely. Don't pull back out of fear; seize the moment and reach out to someone special. You won't know what will happen unless you try."
gemini,2014-11-09,"You may be buzzing around on the analytical planes of existence, but the real work now is found in the deeper emotional realms. Opinionated Jupiter is filling your head with all kinds of outrageous ideas. Meanwhile, Venus is nudging you to respond to sensitive issues surfacing due to romantic attractions. Unfortunately, clever words are just a distraction today; you might need to stop talking in order to say what you really mean. Operate from your heart, not your head, for the most satisfying results."
cancer,2014-11-09,This might be quite a fruitful time if you are in the envious position of developing your creative skills. But just because you have a valid excuse for daydreaming doesn't mean you are able to avoid your responsibilities without any repercussions. Take care of the most pressing concerns before you wander too far off track. Try to capture the magic rather than letting it capture you.
leo,2014-11-09,"You are consciously seeking more meaning from your relationships now. You could be drawn into emotional confusion in response to someone close to you who is sending mixed signals. However, the incoming data may not be as jumbled as you think. Perhaps it is the receiver that needs calibration and not the transmitter. Scaling back your unrealistic expectations helps you cut through the static. Keeping things simple works best for everyone involved."
virgo,2014-11-09,"What you say is less important today than how you say it. There's a world of difference in the various shadings of gray, and now it may be the most subtle nuances that have the greatest impact. Don't be afraid to invest the time needed to be sure that you're delivering the exact message you want to reach others. Avoid exaggeration and misrepresentation at all costs. Sticking with the facts is the easiest way to convey your honorable intentions."
libra,2014-11-09,"You may expect so much from your friends today that you're disappointed with their lackluster performance. However, upon closer analysis, it could be your unrealistic hopes that are the real problem. Although your assumptions might get you into trouble, you can avoid discouragement if you don't set people up on pedestals. Respecting others for who they truly are rather than what you want them to be is the only way to maintain integrity in relationships."
scorpio,2014-11-09,"Your optimism is contagious today, inspiring you to see unrealized potential everywhere you look. However, you could take this Pollyanna attitude so far that it creates an awkward situation if you act on every attraction. Thankfully, it's possible to explore all the amazing scenarios within the privacy of your own imagination. You can always share your feelings in a few days if your enthusiasm persists. The perspective you gain will work to your advantage in the long run."
sagittarius,2014-11-09,"Steer clear of people who may be deceptive and avoid any substances that alter the fabric of reality. Even just a single drink of your favorite libation can have more influence today than usual because your subconscious world is spilling over into awareness and blurring your objectivity. On the other hand, it's not wise to shut the door on your imagination, for it is the best way to communicate with your higher self. Take advantage of your current psychic sensitivity and listen carefully for messages from within."
capricorn,2014-11-09,"Your attempts to keep your feet firmly planted on the ground may be to no avail due to the sometimes magical and oftentimes confusing events of the day. But if you're too serious and close down your heart, you can miss the magic. However, if you forget that you are an earthly Capricorn, you just might go drifting off into space. You must find that sweet spot between pragmatism and idealism to make the most of this cosmically mystical day."
aquarius,2014-11-09,"Boundary issues require your undivided attention today, especially if you find yourself in the middle of a drama that doesn't really belong to you. But you are attracted to opportunities that can be found in the emotional storm, making it more likely to let down your guard. Vulnerability is not necessarily a bad thing, but it can lead to confusion now unless you have the objectivity to distinguish other people's dilemmas from yours. Your love for logic comes in handy now more than ever."
pisces,2014-11-09,"Sometimes the waters appear so clear that you Fish can see forever. However, the truth is that even the most pristine waters still distort whatever you gaze upon. Normally, you take this magnification into consideration without even thinking about it. But it's too easy to forget that nothing is exactly as it seems now. If your vision is larger than life, step back to get a fresh perspective. A reality check and a healthy sense of humor might just save the day."
aries,2014-11-10,Avoidance tactics won't work today as previously hidden emotions seem to come out of nowhere when your ruling planet Mars aligns with penetrating Pluto. Anger springs forth from the depths of your subconscious mind; it's yours and it's wise to own it. Share your hurts so that negativity doesn't turn into resentment. Bringing everything out into the light now gives everyone a chance to process their feelings in a healthy manner and move on.
taurus,2014-11-10,"You might accidentally say something that upsets a friend today. Unfortunately, your good intentions may not be enough to get you through this tricky intersection. Reach into your heart and find a way to express your true feelings, no matter how deeply they are buried. Watch your natural tendency to be stubborn, for inflexibility won't help when it comes to love. Even if you believe you already know the truth, engaging in an honest dialogue widens your perspective and deepens your compassion."
gemini,2014-11-10,"Although you may gingerly dance around a delicate situation, a friend might still present you with a complex emotional problem today. It is unlikely that the tension will settle back down until you face the music. It's easier to roll with the incoming waves of unrelenting intensity when you remember that you'll be feeling more comfortable in just a few days. Don't withdraw by changing the subject since you can learn a lot about yourself from others at this time. Whether you like it or not, the way out is the way through."
cancer,2014-11-10,"Relationships can be a source of major concern now, yet sharing your heart could earn you extra karmic points along with the rewards of intimacy. However, opening up emotionally is not an easy process since you naturally prefer to protect your sensitive feelings from being exposed. Revealing your vulnerability to someone you love today is the first step on the road to healing."
leo,2014-11-10,"Your presentation may be so flamboyant now that it gets in the way of your best intentions. Others might not have the fortitude to stand up to your emotional onslaught today, allowing you to steamroll over their objections. Even if it's your fate to be victorious in a hard-fought battle, you could be the long-term loser unless you also honor what others are feeling. Listen closely to the feedback you receive so you can establish common goals that allow everyone to play a part in the unfolding story."
virgo,2014-11-10,You are on a wild emotional ride now as you feel irrepressible passion one moment and then cool detachment the next. These extreme feelings might be quite upsetting to your rational thinking; it's important to gain enough perspective on the current dynamics so you don't go too far over the edge today. Staying centered is the best way you can respond to the oncoming changes.
libra,2014-11-10,"You might be facing a power struggle in your immediate environment that involves coworkers or family members. The drama begins harmlessly enough, but by the time you realize what's happening, someone is already making their move. As counter-intuitive as it sounds, relinquishing control today could benefit you in the long run. Don't take on any battles that you cannot win now; you'll get your chance soon enough to even the score."
scorpio,2014-11-10,"You may be ready to turn on your nuclear-powered love light today. Or, your emotional radioactivity could prompt you to head for the isolation ward. Your two key planets, Pluto and Mars, are more than eager to pick a fight. Although you are no stranger to strong feelings, these two planets come together now to teach you another lesson about intensity. No matter what happens, take the high road and shine your love for all to see."
sagittarius,2014-11-10,"Your emotional reserve is deep now, empowering you to reach into the dark and explore the mysterious realms of your heart. Today's alignment of hot-headed Mars and cold-blooded Pluto in your 2nd House of Self-Esteem forces you to recognize that there's more to life than blind optimism. Even if you're frightened of what you don't understand, remember that the unknown can transform into an important ally as your awareness grows."
capricorn,2014-11-10,"You display your battle scars with great pride now as the Mars-Pluto conjunction rattles your 1st House of Personality. You want everyone to know what you have endured to survive and what it takes to thrive in your world. But others are not eager to look at your old emotional wounds -- and rightly so. Go ahead and clear the air today, but then be ready to move on. Live fully in the present moment, rather than dwelling on the past."
aquarius,2014-11-10,"Social interactions are a source of unavoidable intensity today. Although you learn a lot from conversations with friends, there could be a severe price to pay for the knowledge. You may be required to set aside your personal agenda now just to be a part of the group. Be careful not to hold on to any petty annoyances or past regrets. It's up to you to let go of whatever stands between you and your happiness."
pisces,2014-11-10,"Someone's power play might sweep you up in a volatile melodrama today. However, you could come out a big winner if your intentions are for the higher good of all. Keep the well-being of your friends and family as your top priority. You will move mountains on your way to great success if you stay in touch with your heart."
aries,2014-11-11,"You might need to accept your current position in a relationship or on the job, especially if you have set your goals so high now that you have little hope of reaching them. But there's no time to wallow in disappointment or fear of failure when you should be acknowledging your successes. Instead of rushing off to set a new course, move ahead by visualizing your ideal destiny. Even if you must be practical in your thinking, your future is dependent on the creativity of your imagination."
taurus,2014-11-11,"Although you think you are in complete control of your schedule, a close friend or coworker might place extra demands on you now. Your initial reaction may be to resist, so it's helpful to remember that everyone just wants to be happy. Look past the current dynamics and focus on the future possibilities. Take the high road and remain calm to reduce the stress before it creates a problem. Giving others the benefit of the doubt keeps your options open right from the start."
gemini,2014-11-11,"You may be searching for ways to advance at work, but it's difficult to concentrate on your regular duties while imagining all the amazing alternatives ahead. You're tempted to spend the day telling everyone what you want to do, but talk is cheap. Grounding your vision in concrete action is more productive now than rambling on about your long-term plans. Dream big but don't leave success to chance."
cancer,2014-11-11,"Your irrepressible desire to express yourself can be enough to get your creative juices flowing today, but you must feel emotionally safe before adding your opinions to the general discussion. It's challenging to openly disagree with others if you're insecure about your ideas. Having all your facts in order empowers you to speak with confidence. But even if you're unsure of your presentation, being true to your feelings is more important now than going along with others just for the sake of peace."
leo,2014-11-11,"Keeping up with your responsibilities is exhausting work, yet you might not want to slow your pace down yet. Nevertheless, you should feel better about your life in general once you set your unfulfilled expectations aside. It's not easy to balance your role as a fearless leader with your current craving for emotional security. Acknowledge your limitations before you receive an unwelcome reality check; adopting a practical approach is better now than aiming for an unrealistic goals."
virgo,2014-11-11,"You're highly susceptible to people's opinions now, even if their statements aren't grounded in truth. You may think your reality filters are working fine as long as your logic is intact. However, it's challenging to separate accurate perceptions from your vivid dreams today, even if you think you're using common sense. Fortunately, seeing the world through rose-colored glasses allows you to entertain a vast array of possibilities that others miss."
libra,2014-11-11,"You should be proud of yourself for exercising patience today since cooling down your emotions prevents you from doing something you might later regret. However, you aren't willing to just let go of a significant goal now, even if it's riddled with unresolved financial issues. Untangle the intertwined threads before trying to figure out your next step. You can trust your intuition as long as your foundation is built on solid facts."
scorpio,2014-11-11,"Reconsidering your spiritual goals makes sense now while metaphysical Neptune collaborates with rational Mercury. Unfortunately, your thoughts don't easily translate into direct action. Everything you do is accompanied by a symphony of hidden emotions, so take your time and consider all your options carefully before picking one to play out loud. Choosing the music is your first step to co-creating your future."
sagittarius,2014-11-11,You Archers often enjoy entertaining others just for the fun of it. But your intricate stories and tall tales can act as a smokescreen that allows you to appear forthcoming today while you're actually hiding your true feelings. Don't let anyone coerce you into revealing more than you choose. Doing what someone else expects is less important now than acknowledging your own personal limits and sticking to them. Demonstrating your strength of conviction is key to your success.
capricorn,2014-11-11,"You aren't very interested in what anyone has to say about your work. You may bore quickly if people aren't willing to back up their opinions with real assistance. A coworker's good idea can help you, but you could reach a point where you realize that talk isn't enough. Tell those around you exactly what you need, even if you don't expect anything to change. Fortunately, sharing your concerns shifts the dynamics, inspiring others to roll up their sleeves and support your cause."
aquarius,2014-11-11,"You might be carried away on the wings of your own feelings today, making them public before taking time to consider the consequences of an emotional disclosure. There's nothing wrong with sharing your inner process in a professional context when appropriate; it's just that you can't retract what you say once it's out on the table. You can travel anywhere you want within your mind's eye. However, saying fewer words now is a better tactic than revealing too much."
pisces,2014-11-11,"You are confident that your current direction is consistent with your larger aspirations, yet others may disagree with your plans anyway. Being criticized isn't anyone's idea of fun, but it's even more challenging now because you believe your intentions are misunderstood. Don't waste your precious energy responding to someone else's negativity today. If you continue to work hard to achieve your goals, your positive results will ultimately justify your choices."
aries,2014-11-12,"You may need to steady yourself today because maintaining your cool is healthier than dealing with the aftermath of a lack of discipline. Although you might want to congratulate yourself for making it this far, you cannot continue in the same manner forever. It's time to reconsider your impulsive behavior and rein in your extreme actions. You have been getting by lately without imposing too much structure on yourself, but making a commitment to be more responsible now can bring you the emotional stability you need."
taurus,2014-11-12,"Be cautious about negotiating away more than you should in order to enter into a favorable agreement today. Even if you know exactly what you want, you might not appreciate what you must give up until it's gone. Consider your limits before relinquishing something of value or you may end up losing your self-respect. You stand to benefit by seriously thinking about what you're about to do before you make a deal. When all else fails, allow your heart to lead you in the right direction."
gemini,2014-11-12,"There's an analytical observer within you now working overtime, making notes and plotting an ambitious course of action, even if your hectic life is filled with craziness. Thankfully, your inner-strategist isn't deterred by all the external chaos. Cultivate this adaptable aspect of your personality as you successfully navigate your way through the turbulent seas that surround you at this time. Trust your moral compass to guide you safely through the storm."
cancer,2014-11-12,"Your temporary sense of isolation might trigger an impulsive reaction today as you attempt to connect with those you love. Unfortunately, your behavior may be in direct conflict with your feelings. Even if you move beyond words, you can't sink fully into your emotions without being reminded of your dilemma. Give yourself plenty of time to let your head and your heart resolve their differences. Finding a way to honor all your needs greatly improves your chances for happiness."
leo,2014-11-12,"The pressure to change continues to build until you discover a way to ease the source of the tension. You could choose to play the role of the rebel by stirring up every hornet's nest you find today. Although this brash approach frees you from having to follow the rules, it's not the most practical strategy. Think your plan all the way through before you do something drastic or you might realize that you have crossed the line and you can't go back. A more moderate approach may be the most intelligent one for now."
virgo,2014-11-12,"You seem to have a more profound sense of what commitments you can make and which ones to sidestep today. Oddly enough, you are being quite practical by considering how each option could affect your feelings. Although you might believe that you understand the full consequences of your current decisions now, you probably don't. Wait a few days for the energy to settle down before making your final choice."
libra,2014-11-12,"You stand up and play your part with admirable style today, even in the face of powerful resistance. In fact, you may perform so well in these tough circumstances now that you can actually change the outcome, snatching success from the closing jaws of defeat. Nevertheless, this is a sobering time as your key planet Venus is held in check by karmic Saturn. Show your true colors by giving your absolute best no matter what happens along the way."
scorpio,2014-11-12,"You're ready for a bit of fun today, but work obligations may force you to delay a previously scheduled social event. Unfortunately, resentment might simmer and start to encroach onto other areas of your life. Thankfully, you can nip a problem in the bud if you're aware of it, so watch for signs of negativity before it surfaces. Facing challenging issues now enables you to emerge from a difficult situation like the legendary Phoenix rising out of the ashes."
sagittarius,2014-11-12,"You could benefit from sage advice from someone you trust today, but you may have a hard time finding anyone who can meet your high expectations. Nevertheless, listen to the voices of experience, even if they don't have all the answers. A simple interaction at work could bring the breakthrough you need as long as you're open to receiving the gifts of wise counsel. When you are a student of life, everyone you meet is a teacher."
capricorn,2014-11-12,"Your outlook may be quite conservative today and your cautious approach could influence your emotions, your finances and your personal relationships. You are quick to grasp the instability of the situation, yet you might not want to take an unnecessary risk now. Your methodical plan has its distinct advantages. Following your instincts by stabilizing what you have helps you avoid being swept up in the chaos around you."
aquarius,2014-11-12,"The cosmic radio is playing your favorite songs today, but the planets are singing along with conflicting messages. Try not to stress out if you can't decide whether to act on your current desire for long-term emotional security or satisfy an impulse for immediate affection. Hold both sides of the spectrum in your thoughts for as long as possible. Hopefully, you can experience the best of both worlds as reality lands you somewhere in the middle."
pisces,2014-11-12,"You might think that you're not receiving enough emotional support from your closest friends now. You could even grow discouraged, but dwelling on negativity isn't the best use of today's productive planetary energy. Instead, observe your current circumstances and isolate anything that makes you feel unhappy. Share your concerns with someone who won't sugarcoat the truth. Although the conversation may not begin smoothly, a good old-fashioned heart-to-heart chat should catalyze positive change."
aries,2014-11-13,"You're inspired by your acute awareness of all the potential that is in front of you now. You may even believe you can overcome any obstacle you meet on your path. However, your optimism creates complications, especially if you assume that you have more to offer than you actually do. Don't try to impress others with passionate promises of stellar performance. Focus your intentions on the present moment without worrying about the future; let your actions speak for you and the respect will follow."
taurus,2014-11-13,"You may believe that someone's solution to your problem will cause more trouble than it's worth. But giant Jupiter is big enough to pull the Sun slightly off center today, so it's best to stop resisting the inevitable. Sometimes your unwavering determination can inadvertently stand in the way of progress. Something needs to give; don't get yourself stuck between the proverbial rock and a hard place. Remain open to what others have to say now and demonstrate your willingness to grow from what you learn."
gemini,2014-11-13,"You want nothing more than to be a superhero today, and your enthusiasm makes it all too easy to get involved in something that is bigger than you realize. In fact, current circumstances appear to be more urgent than they actually are now. Your desire to help others motivates you to jump in before considering the consequences. Instead, reevaluate your choices before making commitments that you cannot possibly keep. Ultimately, several minor heartfelt contributions will have more positive impact than trying to do everything all at once."
cancer,2014-11-13,"It's easy to overextend your energy now because you are on the positive side of a cycle of expansion and contraction. Although a flood of emotions could unleash a burst of visionary energy, it may be a bit overwhelming to integrate the intensity. Thankfully, you can moderate the speed at which new ideas flow into awareness. However, if you are overconfident, you might take on too much all at once. It's healthier to sustain the creative stream rather than throwing caution to the wind and riding the rapids."
leo,2014-11-13,"You may be thrilled that your recent contributions are finally being noticed now that the Sun shines on lucky Jupiter in your cheerful sign. However, the admiration you receive only continues as long as you do your part. You can't rest on your past laurels with the Moon illuminating your 1st House of Self. There are many powerful forces at play that you don't fully understand yet, so it's better not to confront them prematurely. In the meantime, keep up the hard work even if no one is watching."
virgo,2014-11-13,"You could make a choice for all the wrong reasons now if you put your fantasies ahead of the truth. Although you usually consider all the logistics, you're not immune to making a bad decision. Unfortunately, if you blindly follow your dreams, you may have to go back to the beginning and start all over again. Taking extra time to gather your data permits you to work with a new level of objectivity. You have the potential to influence your future more than you realize today if you exercise your powers of discernment."
libra,2014-11-13,"You are currently motivated to do whatever is necessary when it comes to love or money, even if your chosen path makes your life a lot more complicated. However, you might not have much of a choice now. You must match your deepest convictions with decisive behavior if you want to earn the support of those people who are most important to you. Hold your core values high and let your integrity shine."
scorpio,2014-11-13,"Your current drive to restore a sense of balance to your life is unrelenting now. Unfortunately, it's difficult to find equilibrium when you are being seduced by so many tempting opportunities. Thankfully, your career path is favored throughout the next several months, even if your ambitions are causing emotional turmoil. Be patient; don't get discouraged if the harmony you seek seems temporarily elusive. Success is yours if you don't exceed your limits or limit your potential."
sagittarius,2014-11-13,"An irrepressible wave of desire for adventure urges you to put a plan into motion now that your key planet Jupiter is back in the picture. Your current itch to take action is both a strength and weakness, especially if you're tempted to put your muscle toward an undertaking that is better left undone. If you are unsure of the current opportunity, wait a few days for your exuberance to settle down. Once you have reestablished a healthy perspective, you can decide on your next move without much stress at all."
capricorn,2014-11-13,"You may actually believe that you know all the intricate details of what is going on in your social world. The good news is that you tend to look on the bright side of things now. Your creative juices are flowing and you should capitalize on them while you can. The bad news is that you are missing the pragmatic lens you usually use to make decisions, making it challenging to sort out your priorities. Your friends will just encourage you onward without the objectivity you really need, so when in doubt rely on your cautionary nature to save the day."
aquarius,2014-11-13,"Relationship dynamics can grow so out of hand today that they become the source of emotional distress. Paradoxically, your interactions with others are not necessarily unpleasant. Your nervous system operates best under stress, shifting into survival mode when it is pushed to the brink. The adrenaline kicks in and you get to ride the tidal rush as long as you are careful not to go too fast or too far. Keep communication channels wide open for the best results."
pisces,2014-11-13,"You could have an unrealistic understanding of a current situation that's based more on your hopes than on the facts. You may attempt to engage in conversations to increase your clarity, but you still might not fully comprehend what's going on. Unfortunately, you're not likely to solve this problem by just working harder today. Mellow out and just see where the whole thing takes you before deciding your next step. Sometimes following the path of least resistance is your best option."
aries,2014-11-14,"You may actually be enjoying the intensity of your personal relationships because superficial interactions don't seem to fully satisfy you now. You're willing to tenaciously cling to the status quo as you explore the power of deeper feelings, rather than running off to explore a new distraction. But don't try to bury any inconvenient emotions that unexpectedly surface. Acknowledging your changing whims doesn't mean you need to act on them. Being honest isn't always easy yet it's the most reliable way to build a strong foundation and a meaningful connection."
taurus,2014-11-14,"You might assume that it's unnecessary to surround yourself with lots of facts and figures since your friends will probably ride to the rescue at the last moment with the necessary details. Nevertheless, you have an important lesson to learn about relationships now, and expecting others to bail you out can interfere with the process. Do your own analysis and plot out a viable strategy so you don't waste your precious time discussing the logistics that you could handle on your own."
gemini,2014-11-14,"You're eagerly anticipating some creative playtime today because you want to make use of your current ingenuity. But instead of floating off into the clouds of illusion, it's more useful to roll up your sleeves and get down to business. However, the longer you procrastinate, the tougher it is to finish your tasks. Luckily, you can combine your desire for fun with meeting the demands of work by simply changing your attitude. Don't postpone feeling the joy; instead, whistle while you work."
cancer,2014-11-14,"Several different paths lead to the possibility of pleasure, but it's ultimately up to you to choose your direction. But first you must demonstrate that you can set your fears aside and take responsibility for your happiness. Be in the moment if you want to squeeze the most out of it. Your current willingness to take a chance now might be necessary to fulfill your dreams."
leo,2014-11-14,"There is a great contrast between what you are doing today and how you feel about it. Logically, you know exactly what you want, yet you're still reacting from your gut. Ultimately you may be happier if your heart wins out over your logical rationalizations. Practice the art of compassion by meeting others halfway, even if you think you shouldn't compromise at all."
virgo,2014-11-14,"You may struggle to be upfront about your own desires, yet you still expect everyone else to be straightforward and share their needs with you. Unfortunately, this double standard could land you in trouble, especially if you aren't willing to let down your guard. Save your hard bargaining and poker face for some other time; you are better off today simply placing your cards face up on the table and going from there. Trust is a two-way street."
libra,2014-11-14,"Although you could be dreaming about your long-term goals, the gathering of planets in your 2nd House of Personal Values shifts your focus back to the present moment. At first, it might seem as if you can't maintain your integrity while working to fulfill your destiny. However, you can stay true to your core beliefs by modifying your course rather than your destination. It's less about where you are going than about how you get there. Taking the high road demonstrates your strength of character."
scorpio,2014-11-14,"You might believe that others don't appreciate your efforts today, and anything they do or say could provoke a nasty conflict -- even if there's nothing to fight about at all. Unfortunately, the Moon's square to the Sun in your 1st House of Self fuels difficult dynamics in your personal life. Stepping back and taking several deep breaths calms your nerves in the moment, but the passage of time helps even more. Thankfully, you can boost your confidence by channeling your excess energy into productive tasks. No one will argue with your success."
sagittarius,2014-11-14,"Manifesting your dreams proves to be difficult today because obsessing on making something happen can actually have the opposite effect and delay the outcome. The boisterous Leo Moon encourages you to keep others informed of your plans, but her square to the Sun in your 12th House of Privacy suggests that it's smarter to downplay your next move. Keep your final destination in sight, but remember that making many adjustments along the way can help you reach your goals faster than you expect."
capricorn,2014-11-14,"You're not interested in revealing too much of your plan yet, but your motives are probably more transparent than you think. However, you can inadvertently withhold more information than is wise since it's to your advantage if others know which direction you are heading. Although you might lose a little momentum by disclosing too much too fast, you could miss a very important opportunity for personal growth if you don't take a chance and share your heart's desire."
aquarius,2014-11-14,"You might be tempted to put all your hopes into one special relationship, believing that someone else will save you from your own shortcomings. Ironically, you may be hesitant to reveal your needs because you know in your heart that your expectations are unrealistic. Work within the limitations of the current situation instead of setting yourself up for disappointment later on. Fortunately, once you accept the truth you will recognize which steps to take without needing validation from anyone else."
pisces,2014-11-14,"You may be acutely aware of how old habits might prevent you from reaching your ambitious goals. The Leo Moon's presence in your 6th House of Self-Improvement works against your long-term plans by distracting you with too many details. Paradoxically, shifting your focus to the big picture might be more efficient. Working with relevant information is critical, but being buried in endless minutiae won't help your cause. Looking at the forest instead of the trees inspires you to change your ways."
aries,2014-11-15,"You're itching to do something crazy today that goes against everyone's expectations. Your inner child doesn't want to stop to consider the consequences of your actions. Nevertheless, your sense of responsibility grows stronger throughout the day, motivating you to follow your bliss in such a way that you don't totally turn your life upside down. Thankfully, with a little forethought, you can get away with having your cake and eating it, too."
taurus,2014-11-15,"You can transform challenging work into genuine fun today, because you have enough sense to make the best of nearly any situation. You may be so clever and cunning now that people actually believe you're enjoying yourself and offer to pitch in and help. But unlike Tom Sawyer you have a surprise up your sleeve; you will paint the fence to meet your obligations even if no one else shows up. Satisfaction in a job well done is your sweet reward."
gemini,2014-11-15,"You tend to complicate your life by packing too many activities into one day. Ironically, you could accomplish even more if you stop long enough to make a sensible plan instead of flying by the seat of your pants. Although you thrive on spontaneity, it's a frivolity you can't afford now. Be realistic in your thinking and manage your time prudently until you establish a more sustainable pace."
cancer,2014-11-15,"You may have a brilliant idea that enables you to exceed someone's expectations while earning more independence in the process. You want to escape from overly rigid routines and, thankfully, your good-natured approach to work today might just be the catalyst you need. But wishing for something to change isn't enough; you must be willing to work hard in order to maximize your chance to break free."
leo,2014-11-15,"You feel quite safe and secure while you're on your own familiar territory at home or at work today, but captivating Venus is tempting you to try something new. Nevertheless, it's not a wise idea to drop everything in search of carefree indulgences until you take care of timely financial chores. The order of things is significant, so set intelligent priorities and stick with them no matter what. Work now, play later."
virgo,2014-11-15,"You could be extremely self-critical now as you consider your recent behavior in a relationship or on the job. Nothing that anyone says to soothe you is enough to let you off your own hook. Fortunately, you don't have to be your own worst enemy; you're free to change your attitude on a moment's notice. Instead of looking back and thinking about what you could have done differently, look forward and visualize a new and improved scenario. Begin creating your future today by painting it as you see it in your imagination."
libra,2014-11-15,"Hidden obstacles may be more problematic than the obvious ones after the Moon slips into your 12th House of Secrets today. You have a sneaking suspicion that you're missing critical information, but you can't figure out where to look for it or even what it could be. Quit running around in circles chasing after something that might not exist. Simply accept your current limitations without letting them diminish your spirit; your positive attitude makes all the difference in the world now."
scorpio,2014-11-15,"You're cruising for social distractions today as the Virgo Moon is in your 11th House of Community. You're not very motivated to work now; instead, you might prefer to step outside of your comfort zone and explore new territory. Luckily, your friends will probably rise to the occasion and support your recreational plans, even if they think your idea of fun is a bit unusual. Be flexible and meet them halfway, if necessary, so you can experience the camaraderie of communing with your tribe."
sagittarius,2014-11-15,"Instead of accepting anyone else's authority today, take charge of your life the best way you see fit. Although others may be fully capable of contributing their expertise, your applicable knowledge gives you a distinct edge. Luckily, you can surprise everyone now with your superior organizational skills. Don't be afraid to let people know what your plan is prior to your implementation. Adopting a more inclusive approach makes it easier for friends and family to help you reach your goals."
capricorn,2014-11-15,"You want to run away from your current responsibilities and escape to somewhere that no one can find you now. But it's not as if you're feeling like your regular down-to-earth self today as the Moon opposes imaginative Neptune in your 9th House of Adventure. Nevertheless, your daydreams can serve a therapeutic purpose; you don't have to travel anywhere exotic in order to feel relief. There's no need to integrate your flights of fancy with the real world as long as you keep track of which is which."
aquarius,2014-11-15,"You're yearning to break out of a stagnant relationship pattern, but you have enough common sense now to bide your time and see what develops. Nevertheless, you're not likely to negotiate away your independence and won't be happy unless you express your personal freedom. Others will be more open to compromise if you show up with warmth and honesty. Your self-reliance is admirable, but beware of the emotional cost of striking out on your own."
pisces,2014-11-15,"You may believe you can drift along in a current relationship as it is, yet your friend or lover might want more of a commitment than you prefer to make today. But discussing uncomfortable issues isn't your cup of tea, even if your partner seems to thrive on the conversation. If you acquiesce without expressing your needs, you could set a bad precedence for the future. Don't just give in to someone's demands to avoid an awkward discussion; you have a lot to learn now by exploring your resistance, instead."
aries,2014-11-16,"Although you may be looking at life through a conceptual lens today, you can be much more effective if you bring everything down to a manageable size. Rather than considering the long-term consequences of your current actions now, limit your thinking to the immediate impact. There is nothing to be gained by attempting to solve all the world's problems; just make small improvements to your own life and let the ramifications of each of your actions ripple outward naturally."
taurus,2014-11-16,"Someone's harsh words could cut deeply today, leaving you feeling hurt or even betrayed. You might even question a friend's motives and wonder about their loyalty. Your natural tendency is to defend your position while also protecting your self-esteem. However, you're being offered an opportunity to step outside of your comfort zone and learn from past mistakes. The choice is yours; seal off your boundaries to criticism or push past your fear of failure. Even one golden nugget of truth can jump start your personal growth."
gemini,2014-11-16,"It's tricky to follow through with consistent action today because your thoughts are bouncing back and forth between the small and the large. You notice every tiny detail now that the discriminating Virgo Moon aligns with superhero Mars. Meanwhile, social Venus enters uplifting Sagittarius, widening your perspective and enticing you to explore distant galaxies. Attempting to make a logical decision may be an exercise in futility; however, following a hunch just might be your best chance for success."
cancer,2014-11-16,"Your attitude determines how much you will actually accomplish today. If you concentrate on the immediate tasks at hand, you could power through your chores more efficiently than anyone might suspect. But if you scatter your energy by dreaming about the far-off future, you may end up annoyed with how much you still have to finish at the end of the day. Scale back your big thinking so you can take care of the little things first."
leo,2014-11-16,"It's tempting to leave what you're doing if you get the chance to express your excitement competitively or impulsively run with someone else's idea today. However, it's more productive to follow through on whatever you previously started or you could suffer from harsh self-criticism later. One tactic to help you focus now is to consciously limit your activities. Walking away from your work is not a smart strategy, especially when you can channel your creativity into the present moment."
virgo,2014-11-16,"It seems as if your emotions are settling down now that the practical Virgo Moon harmonizes with Pluto and Mars. However, you might be uncharacteristically overconfident as you contemplate your next chapter. Don't trust your logic today, especially if your future looks too good to be true. Balancing your new found sense of adventure with a bit of common sense enables you to take advantage of the current planetary magic."
libra,2014-11-16,"Finishing up an old project this weekend is a wise plan so you can be free to tackle new problems that show up next week. Unfortunately, it may not be all that simple to take care of business now because your standards are so high that you find it nearly impossible to meet your lofty expectations. Stop procrastinating; you can't delay the inevitable by ignoring what needs to be done today."
scorpio,2014-11-16,"It's perfectly acceptable to be as picky as you want about your social commitments because you don't have time to waste today. But even if you have room on your schedule, it's still healthier to be the master of your own destiny than to fall in line with someone else's agenda. Nevertheless, distancing yourself from friends and family isn't useful, either. If you manage your calendar more efficiently you can hang out with others and still follow your bliss."
sagittarius,2014-11-16,"Broadcasting your optimism allows others to get a sense of the big picture as you see it. But you can become so enamored with your vision of the future now that you might miss what is happening right in front of your nose. Although it's hard to resist throwing yourself into another fantastic pursuit, it's more helpful to be as pragmatic as possible today. Whether you like it or not, exercising self-restraint improves your chances of reaching your goals."
capricorn,2014-11-16,"You believe that you have a workable plan in place to fulfill your dreams, but it might not turn out quite as sweet as you wish. No matter how much you try to narrow your focus today, your thinking is still in an inflationary phase. However, your best ideas lose their value if you take them too far. Paradoxically, keeping your expectations in check now could actually enable you to accomplish even more."
aquarius,2014-11-16,Your friends and acquaintances could steer you in the right direction now as amicable Venus moves into your 11th House of Community. But you are still inclined to withdraw and think things through on your own. Aim to find a happy medium between losing yourself in a crowd and avoiding others altogether. Establishing stronger connections with the right people makes your investment of time worthwhile.
pisces,2014-11-16,"You may be rethinking relationship strategies now as the Moon camps out in your 7th House of Companions. No doubt, juggling your domestic responsibilities with social obligations is complicated. But, instead of flitting from one thing to another, pick one task and follow it all the way through to its conclusion. After you finish, shift gears and do something else. Staying on a narrowly defined path could bring the stability you seek so you can apply your efforts more creatively next week."
aries,2014-11-17,"You might set out to please everyone today, but ironically could end up alienating others if you don't consider your needs, too. The sociable Libra Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions prompts you to deny your own desires so you can take care of someone else. Unfortunately, codependency doesn't help anyone reach true satisfaction. Avoid the trappings of frustration by expressing what you want as honestly as possible. Friendship and intimacy grow from a foundation of integrity and trust."
taurus,2014-11-17,"Being of service to others isn't only a kind thing to do, it's also productive now that the Moon is in your 6th House of Work. Earning money isn't your primary concern today; helping those who are less fortunate is your top priority. Perhaps you have a personal stake in the matter and are trying to pay back a debt to society to balance old karma. In any case, it's healthy to know your limits by acknowledging what you're willing to sacrifice to achieve your altruistic goals. Making commitments is serious business, so think twice before overextending yourself."
gemini,2014-11-17,"You're searching for little ways to alter the daily routines of your life, but you don't want to upset the status quo. Perhaps you have grown tired of having so many good ideas, only to discover that the big things in your life remain unchanged. Although you may prefer to avoid thinking about uncomfortable issues, you need to make a viable plan to take you to the next level. Continue to unfold your new goals slowly now since the tiniest modifications can have the longest-lasting impact."
cancer,2014-11-17,"Family dynamics are in the spotlight when the Moon returns to your 4th House of Security today. If parenting is your main responsibility, then you could have less free time available for other activities now. Your primary motivation is about being available to those you love, even if doing so keeps you from something else you might enjoy. Fortunately, the quiet satisfaction derived from nurturing a loved one may be the greatest gift you can receive."
leo,2014-11-17,"You long for some quiet time today so you can think about the recent twists and turns in your life. Unfortunately, the road ahead may not be very easy to navigate, so it's a sensible idea to visualize a more direct route to success. Don't be concerned if there aren't immediate changes in your circumstances; it may take some time for the current resistance to fade away. In the meantime, concentrate on reaching your destination; your unwavering determination carries more influence than you realize."
virgo,2014-11-17,"You may encounter an unexpected speed bump on the road of life today and though it requires you to slow down, there's no need for a detour. Just take unscheduled events in stride and do the best you can to maintain a healthy sense of humor. Don't succumb to discouragement, even if you face a setback now. Consider obstacles as perfect opportunities to keep fine-tuning your plan. Strengthening your body, mind and spirit increases your chances for success."
libra,2014-11-17,"Your responsibilities aren't as simple as you had wished today, setting the tone for the entire week ahead. Don't waste precious energy trying to put on a happy face for others, just because that's what they expect from you. It isn't your job to make everyone feel comfortable with your emotional process. Nevertheless, it's up to you to ask yourself the tough questions so you can gain clarity about the next chapter of your life."
scorpio,2014-11-17,You have reached an unavoidable fork in the road. Projects that have required your attention throughout the year may be reaching a point of completion. Or you might realize things are not turning out as expected and you must cut your losses and move on. The time for talking about your dilemma is over; the Moon's presence in your 12th House of Secrecy urges you to keep your thoughts to yourself now. There's nothing to be gained from idle chit-chat today; concentrate your efforts on deciding what to hold on to and what to let go.
sagittarius,2014-11-17,"You don't have a lot of free time available today, but you still want to escape for a little while, anyhow. Meanwhile, your workmates keep reminding you of how many tasks you still have to complete. There are only so many hours in the day, so you may not be able to take time off to play now. Thankfully, you can accomplish much more than you realize, so your extra efforts will be rewarded. Follow the good advice you receive and attack the business at hand with a positive attitude."
capricorn,2014-11-17,"An excessive amount of stress could act as a powerful catalyst today, giving you a perfect chance to prove your competence to your boss. The reflective Moon meandering through your 10th House of Career marks the culmination of your recent efforts or the beginning of an exciting new project. In either case, this is no time to relax. Don't worry if no one seems to be acknowledging your contributions yet. Keep up your ongoing commitment to excellence and the recognition will follow."
aquarius,2014-11-17,"Even your well thought-out plans could meet unexpected opposition today, but your best ideas can still reach fruition if you're open to making tactical changes along the way. There's no room for false pretenses; acting as if you have all the answers won't help you achieve your goals any faster. Nevertheless, something must shift; fortunately, others are more willing to meet you halfway if you demonstrate humility. There's no need to give up if you're wise enough to modify your strategy before it's too late."
pisces,2014-11-17,"You could face a tricky situation today if you need to deal with someone who holds authority over you while remaining unsupportive of your efforts. Although this difficult climb requires extra determination to reach your destination, the process also makes you stronger. Don't complain about your obligations; just roll up your sleeves and get to work. Putting forth your best effort now eventually brings the rewards and recognition you seek."
aries,2014-11-18,"Dealing with restrictions placed on you by a close friend or lover may be more difficult than you think today. Although your concerns are based on reality, your fears complicate the situation more than necessary. Although you might want to head for the nearest exit, the problem deepens if you avoid talking about your feelings. Thankfully, pushing past your resistance and initiating a dialogue is the first step toward resolving tension. Starting a conversation about a delicate subject is challenging, but it should get easier once the ball is rolling."
taurus,2014-11-18,"A coworker may be overly critical of your fixed nature today, but your first inclination is to entirely resist the label. In fact, you might claim that your integrity depends on your ability to stick to your values, even in the face of opposition. It's true that self-defense requires commitment, but you're likely to overdo it now. State your case clearly, but don't try to convince others that your point of view is the only correct one. Honoring diversity is your key to success."
gemini,2014-11-18,"You might be up to your eyeballs in work now that the demanding Sun-Saturn conjunction falls in your 6th House of Employment. You get what you deserve today, so don't try to outsmart karma; all you need to do is show up with a positive attitude. A methodical approach enables you to gamble on your future without jeopardizing recent gains. Weigh the potential rewards against the possible risks before you invest your valuable energy in a project."
cancer,2014-11-18,"Pressing responsibilities require your full attention today, but your willingness to go the extra mile at work could win you the support you need to accomplish them. You might even persuade someone to postpone your deadline if you can muster up enough courage to ask. However, your obligations won't disappear on their own. Nevertheless, giving solid voice to your intentions now may be enough to shift the energy in your favor."
leo,2014-11-18,"You're emotionally invested in reaching a specific goal, but your coworkers might not even notice your ambitious behavior today. Perhaps your profound desire to get ahead now isn't obvious to others because your real destination is not a place based on observable landmarks. Don't worry about what anyone else thinks; just stick close to your agenda and let everyone draw their own conclusions. Remember, the real measure of your success is how you feel about yourself."
virgo,2014-11-18,"You work best when you have a detailed plan that you can execute without deviation; however, your flexibility is warranted today if circumstances shift without warning. In fact, your willingness to respond to unexpected schedule changes may alleviate the tension before it grows into a crisis. When unplanned events create chaos, pay attention to your emotional reactions without necessarily acting on your feelings. Fortunately, you can emerge a hero by maintaining a calm demeanor in the face of stress."
libra,2014-11-18,"A disagreement about work ethics or core values might have you throwing your hands up in the air today because you don't know which side to support. Unfortunately, you're still learning about the current dynamics and there's no easy way to untangle the facts. You may think that you know what's real, but the truth seems to change every few hours. Wait and see how the situation develops before playing your hand. Committing to a game plan too soon can end up being disruptive now, but delaying too long could mean missing your opportunity. Timing is everything."
scorpio,2014-11-18,"Fantasies may assume a significant role in your life now, yet your illusions could come crashing down to earth before the day is done. It's wise to be proactive and channel your desires into productivity instead of focusing on your dreams. Concentrate on the most practical issues on your plate now that the responsible Sun-Saturn conjunction in Scorpio is commanding center stage. You may be surprised with all the useful ideas you have today once you make up your mind to apply your creative talents to your job."
sagittarius,2014-11-18,"You are standing at a turning point and the circumstances that were holding you back just last week now begin to fade into the past. Your enthusiasm is on the rise but it's not realistic to think that everything will automatically shift overnight. Nevertheless, you can feel strong winds of change blowing into your life and extra patience is necessary as you move through the current transformation. Have faith; the waiting is the hardest part."
capricorn,2014-11-18,"You are truly a force to be reckoned with today as your ruling planet Saturn is illuminated by the radiant Sun. You must singularly apply yourself to the tasks at hand or you could be pulled off course by an enticing invitation from your friends. However, an all-or-nothing approach to the work/play dilemma isn't very useful now; aim for the middle of the road, instead. Steering clear of extremes improves your chances of reaching your destination in a timely manner."
aquarius,2014-11-18,"You may be dragged into an unpleasant conversation about your goals at work today. Do not attempt to avoid the conversation. You cannot shirk your responsibilities because others are depending on you now to tell them what you think. If you can't put your ideas into words, leading by example still enables you to assume the authority you deserve. In any case, give it your absolute best shot by being one hundred percent certain that everyone knows exactly where you stand on the matter in question."
pisces,2014-11-18,"You could be sending mixed messages today as the peace-loving Libra Moon encourages you to avoid conflict at all costs. However, the restrictive Sun-Saturn conjunction simultaneously demands that you stay true to your principles, even if doing so creates discomfort or conflict. Although these two approaches don't blend well, you must honor both of them in your interactions with others. Don't force an answer now; simply bring all your contradictions out into the open. Resolution will happen on its own schedule if you're completely honest."
aries,2014-11-19,"There's no reason to be pushy today because it won't help you achieve your goals any faster. Actually, your relationship interactions could be more meaningful if you consciously participate in give and take, instead of trying to control a current situation. Keep in mind this diplomatic strategy doesn't require you to relinquish your dreams. In fact, you can experience more emotional fulfillment if you take the time to connect with others along your way to success."
taurus,2014-11-19,"You can make real progress today if you don't fall behind on your professional commitments. But you could end up wasting valuable resources by looking for a faster way through the quagmire of your responsibilities. Unfortunately, taking a shortcut won't likely save you any time; it's wiser to follow the tried and true path of good old-fashioned work. Whatever you don't do now will require even more effort later on. Demonstrate your strength of character by exceeding the expectations of others."
gemini,2014-11-19,"Your irrepressible desire to experience pleasure may clash with other people's plans today, even if your intention is to keep your needs to yourself. Although you can see things objectively for a while, you won't likely be able to remain emotionally detached forever. Sooner or later, your real feelings will leak out, revealing what you truly want. Life is easier if you are honest right from the start."
cancer,2014-11-19,"You keep revisiting an intense emotional issue today, turning it over and over in your mind while trying to resolve it. You might choose to remain silent, since you believe that others can intuitively know what you want now, without you saying a word. Unfortunately, suppressing your desires only sets you farther back from your goals. It's wiser to put your feelings out in the open just to clear the air and move forward from there. No one can blame you for telling the truth."
leo,2014-11-19,"You may receive some much-needed support at the last moment today. Thankfully, you might not have to ask for anything; people just show up happy to follow your lead. However, complications could arise if you try to accomplish too much because you can't expect everyone else to work at your fast pace. Don't push your luck now; just be thankful for whatever assistance comes your way and remember to return the favor when you can."
virgo,2014-11-19,"Moving a project forward can be quite time consuming today because your current ambitions could awaken envy or jealousy in someone else. Even if most of your friends are rooting for you, some of them may thwart your efforts because they believe that success is going to your head. If you wish to keep the peace now, temporarily moderate your approach; any goal worth reaching will still be there later on. Don't let your lofty ambitions get in the way of the connections that matter most."
libra,2014-11-19,"The same obstacles that have been in your way for a while may temporarily seem insurmountable. However, the Moon's current visit to your sign of balance affords you an objective view to your dilemma. Although someone's uninvited participation might annoy you, it's smarter now to adapt to their presence rather than striking out on your own. Unfortunately, working more won't necessarily help. Instead, quit trying so hard and watch the pieces magically fall into place."
scorpio,2014-11-19,"You may want to retreat from the ever-maddening crowds, but your escapist fantasies might not have the space to manifest now. Although you enjoy collaborating with others when they share your focus, you have grown weary of their familiar antics. Be patient or you could lose your temper now as frustration builds in anticipation of stressful days ahead. Listening to your natural rhythms reminds you when it's time for a break from excess distractions. Taking yourself a little less seriously helps more than you think."
sagittarius,2014-11-19,"You could easily work yourself into a state of anxiety if you try to finalize your long-term plans today. However, a cluster of planets is stirring the cosmic energy of your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, adding ambiguity to your options. Instead of making a final decision now, take time to contemplate the various paths that lead to your destiny. You can always pick up where you left off and get back to business tomorrow. Reaching for the stars shouldn't be such hard work."
capricorn,2014-11-19,"Process any lingering tension you're feeling now while the ambivalent Libra Moon gently brings up issues that could get in your way of success. Fortunately, you're able to fulfill your ambitious needs now if you maintain a graceful sense of balance. Talk about your concerns; whatever you discuss today can help to alleviate the stress over the days ahead. But don't let down your guard or your concentration might falter; you could easily lose your equilibrium as quickly as it arrived."
aquarius,2014-11-19,"It's absolutely essential to bring an open mind to any conversation that arises today because you don't know in advance where it will lead. You may be more interested in learning about something entirely new than forming an opinion on a previously discussed matter. Pay close attention to your message, because you could inadvertently spin the energy in a negative direction. Staying aware of the complexity of an issue is likely to reduce unnecessary conflict."
pisces,2014-11-19,"You may have an awkward encounter today when you realize that a previous goal has become significantly less important than it was. It's not that your opinions are randomly changing; it's just that your perspective is broadening now, which enables you to understand alternative viewpoints. However, don't be overly accommodating unless it comes from the heart. It's better to dig in your heels and hold a position that matters, instead of wasting precious energy trying to regain control later on."
aries,2014-11-20,"In your current quest for independence you could inadvertently set yourself up for consequences that you don't understand. Circumstances seem so surreal that it is possible to create goals based upon your fantasies now, rather than what is actually attainable. This confusion can catch you off guard and lead to disillusionment when you realize that you missed your chance because you misinterpreted the events. The more you stick to the facts, the less you'll have to apologize for later."
taurus,2014-11-20,"Your lack of attention to details may land you in trouble today, especially if you thought that you could somehow be in two places at once. But, of course, you can't and you need to limit your options even if it's difficult to make the choice. Don't put too much energy into second guessing your decision once you've made up your mind; doubt will only send you into a tailspin. Rely on your natural pragmatism now rather than on your imagination."
gemini,2014-11-20,"Coworkers might be the primary source of your current headache today if they present you with an idea that appears attractive at first glance. Unfortunately, you're seeing things as you wish them to be now rather than how they truly are. It's fine to give others the benefit of the doubt as long as you don't assume everything will be perfect. Instead of pursuing someone else's idealistic dreams, follow your own agenda. A solid foundation is your ticket to success."
cancer,2014-11-20,"Your current goals could be based on your fantasies, making them nearly impossible to reach in the real world. You might even convince yourself that it's a straight shot to your destination without realizing how far you must actually travel. Thankfully, you don't have to give up on your dreams if you put them in a healthy perspective. Pursue any opportunity that moves you closer to your heart's desire, but don't become too attached to the outcome. Find joy along the way instead of at the journey's end."
leo,2014-11-20,"Although you're quite confident about your ability to persuade others to join your cause, things may not turn out as planned today. There are emotional surprises lurking behind the most enticing situations, muddling your intentions and confusing your direction. This foggy cosmic landscape lingers for a couple of days, but you can find undiscovered treasures buried in your imagination if you're open to exploring the unknown. Move cautiously and enjoy the magic of the mists while the uncertainty lasts."
virgo,2014-11-20,"Your current inclination is to put a positive spin on everything. You could be wrapped up in daydreams of romantic love only to be confronted by mundane events that must be decisively handled today. Nevertheless, you don't have to hide your flights of fancy from everyone. You can enjoy sharing your fantasies with your closest friends as long as you keep it separate from managing your responsibilities. Consciously placing one foot in each realm allows you to dance between the real world and your imagination."
libra,2014-11-20,"Expressing your feelings to a close friend is a good start, but it's just not enough. You must sugar coat your words today for your message to have the impact you desire. However, it may be so easy to lay on the sweetness that you can irritate others if you overdo it. Relying on your charm makes sense as long as you don't lose your original intention by completely sidestepping the issue. Treating others kindly also means telling the truth."
scorpio,2014-11-20,Demonstrate your creativity today by seeking ways to manifest beauty in your interactions with others. It's as if the Muse has come to visit and won't leave until you recognize the magic that's in your heart. But don't waste this day drifting around aimlessly in your dreams. Bring the metaphysical treasures you discover back into the real world. Combine the ethereal with the mundane for maximum effect.
sagittarius,2014-11-20,"Your romantic expectations may be so high today that your actual experience cannot be fully satisfying. Unfortunately, you could set a relationship up for failure as surreal Neptune squares sweetheart Venus in your visionary sign, prompting you to choose fantasy over reality. However, your fascination with a dream can also be quite inspiring as long as you understand the laws of the universe. Losing yourself in a poetic vision can be life-changing if you remember to return to earth when you're done."
capricorn,2014-11-20,"A sudden vision of your future could be the source of personal inspiration now, but it's also the origin of a problem. You can be so enamored with your plans that you take every chance you get to share them with whomever will listen. Your exuberance is endearing, but others might not understand your excitement. Talking a little less and smiling a little more gives you time to seamlessly integrate your dreams into your life. Maintaining an air of mystery today keeps everyone on their toes."
aquarius,2014-11-20,"Emotional detachment typically helps you decide your course of action, especially when it pertains to mundane matters like making money. But your goals are fuzzy now and it's tricky to sort out your priorities. Intuitively, you know you are looking at your financial situation through rose-colored glasses, but you can't seem to remove them today. Instead of struggling to uncover the facts, acknowledge the role your dreams can play in molding your future and save the hard choices until your clarity returns."
pisces,2014-11-20,"It's tough to know who your true friends are today because the incoming signals are complicated by your own illusions. You could become so confused that it's hard to find your way back to the truth. However, once you accept the notion that your reality filter isn't fully functioning now, it's easier to navigate your way through the outer world. Steer clear of hypothetical meanderings unless you're playing music or writing poetry. Otherwise, take everything at face value without adding your dreams to the mix."
aries,2014-11-21,"You could be needlessly concerned about a nagging issue today that ultimately isn't very important at all. Consider the consequences of your words before your anger provokes you to say something that is hurtful. Fortunately, your actions speak louder than words with your key planet Mars marching through your 10th House of Status. You might find it challenging to keep your rapid reactions under control, but it is surely worth the effort. Worrying about the wrong things is a waste of your precious time."
taurus,2014-11-21,"You might not be able to establish a sustainable work pace at first, but your persistence should pay off today. You may resist an associate's advice because you want to quickly fulfill your obligations, only to realize that you must do something again if it isn't exactly right. Don't be obstinate if you discover you're wrong. Relationships will improve if you are flexible enough to listen to reason instead of fearfully holding onto a perspective that doesn't stand up to the truth. A change will do you good."
gemini,2014-11-21,"Your nerves are on edge today as your key planet Mercury aligns with combative Mars and ruthless Pluto. Your legendary wit may be too sarcastic now, turning clever words into verbal punches. However, your coworkers won't likely stand for any misplaced aggression. Even a casual conversation might quickly escalate into open conflict unless you restrain your own reactions. If the subject of a disagreement isn't urgent, keep the peace by backing down as gracefully as possible. Choose your battles carefully; knowing when to walk away can save the day."
cancer,2014-11-21,"It's nearly impossible to dramatically alter your routines now, even if you understand how much it could help to make some basic improvements in your lifestyle. Unfortunately, knowing the truth isn't always enough because your behavior doesn't automatically conform to your thinking. Nevertheless, you're still ultimately responsible for whatever you do, so don't just take the path of least resistance. Intention is your not-so-secret weapon; use it wisely."
leo,2014-11-21,"You could convince yourself that you are on such an important mission today that nothing can possibly get in your way. Ironically, your own self-doubt might be a roadblock to your success. It's prudent to dig deeper in search of the truth, but questioning your abilities is a serious waste of time and energy now. Although you may not be able to make your fears disappear overnight, you don't have to sit idly by and let them control your destiny. Channel your inner Lion and roar."
virgo,2014-11-21,"No matter how much you want to follow your prearranged schedule, unseen forces prevent you from executing your plan. You could let stress get the best of you today if you are too inflexible. You might even lose your temper and say something to a loved one without stopping to comprehend the negative impact of your words until it's too late. If tension is mounting, remind yourself to take a deep breath and remain adaptable. Whether you like it or not, going along with the flow is smarter now than fighting it."
libra,2014-11-21,"Your infamous indecision is not a problem today; in fact, you may be making up for lost time as you swiftly respond to current circumstances with definitive answers. You could be quite stubborn if someone suggests you are being uncooperative now, since you don't believe for a moment that you're the one who is stirring up trouble. Luckily, your day takes an unexpected turn for the better when you relax the reins of control just enough to give others some ownership in the unfolding situation."
scorpio,2014-11-21,"Your thoughts are so loud today that you might believe everyone can actually hear what you're thinking. Red-hot Mars fires up cerebral Mercury in passionate Scorpio, coercing you to speak your mind before considering the consequences. Your honesty is admirable but not if you hit below the belt. Luckily, you have the power to transmute fear into love, enabling you to choose the most creative path in each of your interactions. Think with your heart for the best results."
sagittarius,2014-11-21,"Your current action plan could be flawed with irrational logic or incorrect assumptions, even if you believe that you're traveling on the path to success. Thankfully, you can overcome poor reasoning by trusting your intuition now. Don't fret about the details; just play it by ear as you move through the day. Save further analysis for a later date; explore your imagination to find the truth without trying to justify what you learn."
capricorn,2014-11-21,"You're a tough opponent in a public debate today, but stop to evaluate the price you may need to pay for your victory. Ruthless intentions could be unleashed now if you take a position contrary to your friends or associates. Ultimately, you're the only person who can decide whether or not it's worth it. There are no right or wrong choices as long as you think about the ramifications in advance, and not after creating needless antagonism. Listening to your heart might reveal a compromise based on kindness and not on conflict."
aquarius,2014-11-21,"You may feel insecure today about your success at work, but you should be able to transcend your fears through spiritual practice. For some, prayer is the best method for handling the current stress, but your personal journey might also include dance, meditation, or an artistic pursuit. As long as you can step outside of your mundane concerns now, it doesn't really matter which tools you use to awaken your cosmic connection."
pisces,2014-11-21,"It certainly seems like everything is requiring more time than it should as far as you are concerned. It's as if your efforts to move into the next exciting phase of your life are blocked by unknown forces. Oddly enough, the more you think about overcoming the obstacles, the larger they become. You need to relax and reclaim your objectivity before forging ahead. Reexamining your priorities and readjusting your plans sets you up for success."
aries,2014-11-22,"No matter what you imagine now, the week ahead will likely unfold differently than you expect. The Sagittarius New Moon accentuates your 9th House of Future Vision, opening your mind to all the opportunities, but it's not wise to choose any one path yet. Just be thankful for any progress you make considering all the exciting distractions, even if it seems as if you aren't gaining on your goals. Ironically, you may look back happily on these days when you realize how much you actually accomplished."
taurus,2014-11-22,"You could make a simple error in judgment if you're moving too fast today, so take your time when dealing with issues of substance. The philosophical Sagittarius New Moon energizes your 8th House of Deep Sharing, inspiring you to be radically honest in your relationships. However, you may become so fascinated with the big picture that you could leave out a critical detail. Taking a methodical approach when it comes to matters of the heart enables you to cover all your bases now just in case."
gemini,2014-11-22,"Your positive attitude has an immediate impact on your most intimate relationships today. But even a partnership that appears stable can be stressed by the independent Sagittarius New Moon emphasizing your 7th House of Others. Perspectives are shifting and your proactive attention helps to revitalize the interpersonal dynamics as long as you don't try to control the situation. Rather than worrying about what might go wrong now, focus on the potential for success."
cancer,2014-11-22,"You may have ambitious expectations about finishing several projects today, but your high hopes might be dashed while the Sagittarius New Moon magnifies your 6th House of Work. Paring back your goals makes sense, since you could exhaust your resources if you take on too much. Breaking up a major project into bite-sized tasks allows you to rise above your current temptation to commit to more than you can deliver. Concentrate on quality not quantity for the best results."
leo,2014-11-22,"Your most innovative ideas carry you far beyond your normal limitations while the inspirational Sagittarius New Moon activates your 5th House of Play. Don't be afraid to express your bold creativity now, since there's no logical reason to keep it hidden. Whether you find satisfaction or not, accepting the consequences of your current actions empowers you to move on to the next big thing without restraint. When the world is your playground, anything can happen."
virgo,2014-11-22,"It's a brand new day and you can make a fresh start handling family issues while the Sagittarius New Moon rouses your 4th House of Foundations. However, your current direction must be consistent with your long-term goals or you won't get very far. Honor your heart's desires, even if they seem totally irrational to others. Trust your gut instincts because the answers you seek arise from your subconscious now and not from logical analysis. Sometimes the most important things cannot be seen."
libra,2014-11-22,"Your schedule may be spinning out of control today because your good intentions led you to make too many promises. The Sagittarius New Moon excites your 3rd House of Distractions, ensuring a hectic schedule even if you cancel an appointment or decline a social invitation. Nevertheless, this can also be an exhilarating time now. There's no need to worry; the intensity will settle down soon enough. In the meantime, ride the energetic wave and make the most of the momentum while it lasts."
scorpio,2014-11-22,"Your core beliefs may be called into question as today's Sagittarius New Moon falls in your 2nd House of Values. Although external events could raise a red flag that triggers your concern, there's a good chance that others might actually be following your lead now. Remember, no one else can make you feel better about who you are; your self-worth must come from within. Don't let anyone dim your light; shine, baby, shine."
sagittarius,2014-11-22,"Your life path is continuing to change, and today's empowering New Moon in your sign is your ticket to the next stage of your continuing personal growth. Opportunities that are presented to you now are really messages that originate in the heart of the cosmos. It may take time to understand the full significance of current events; in the meantime, gratefully receive the gifts that arrive on your doorstep with an open mind and a trusting heart."
capricorn,2014-11-22,"A strange turn of events might throw you for a loop today, but you could miss the greater meaning of your experience if you stick to the basic facts. The profound Sagittarius New Moon gives prominence to your 12th House of Fantasy, indicating that your dreams also have something special to teach you now. Life could grow more confusing if you suppress whatever you can't understand. However, once you accept that there are no straightforward solutions, you will grow in ways that make you wiser and stronger."
aquarius,2014-11-22,"Your inspiring thoughts are guiding you on an unexpected vision quest today. Thankfully, you possess great potential to see a variety of possibilities that were previously hidden, but a sincere commitment is necessary to make your dreams come true. The forward-thinking Sagittarius New Moon occurs in your 11th House of Long-Term Goals, leading you into the future by shining the light of awareness on your brightest hopes. Focus your attention on the road ahead rather than looking in the rear view mirror and reminiscing about the past."
pisces,2014-11-22,"Your career objectives are evolving now as the Sagittarius New Moon stimulates your 10th House of Status, giving you a fresh opportunity to set a new professional path. Even if you're eagerly anticipating the upcoming changes, don't overreact to current events. Taking things slowly and steadily works to your advantage as you navigate this tricky bend in the road. Don't become too attached to your present path, since you may need to modify your course as you go."
aries,2014-11-23,"You may be so caught up in your personal vision of the future that you lose focus on what you're doing in the present moment. Making a far-reaching decision could create problems if you don't stop to think about the impact of your current actions. Fortunately, you have an excellent chance to advance toward your destination if you remember your original intent. Your dreams are highly motivational as long as you take concrete steps today."
taurus,2014-11-23,"You might be overly confident that everyone will support your agenda today, even if you don't have all your ducks in a row yet. However, people aren't willing to jump on your bandwagon unless they have sufficient facts to justify your plans. Although you may make an emotional appeal, you could come across more aggressive now than you intend. Soften your approach since you appear overly desperate if you push too hard. Letting others reach their conclusions in their own time ultimately works better for all involved."
gemini,2014-11-23,"Misinterpreting another person's actions is possible today since you're prone to making snap judgments. You react so quickly now that logic doesn't even have a chance to influence your behavior. You might believe that people are angry when they are only expressing their true convictions. But open conflict won't lead to a satisfactory solution, so don't confuse someone's disagreement with a personal attack. Simply clarify your differences and seek common ground to create a foundation of trust."
cancer,2014-11-23,"Although you haven't lost your eye for detail, it's easier to see the potential in a situation now rather than what's wrong. It's not in your nature to criticize anyone; you would rather help those you love accomplish something meaningful. Your approval influences the changing circumstances by motivating others to reach for the stars. It doesn't require a lot of effort to find something nice to say -- and your support goes a long way toward boosting someone's self-confidence. Ultimately, you benefit from the power of positive thought just as much as anyone else."
leo,2014-11-23,"Expressing your passion for a cause is one thing, but instigating a fight to prove yourself right is totally different. Although you might inadvertently turn a bit of intelligent caution into a battle of egos, this unwise strategy doesn't give you the platform to demonstrate your wisdom. You could accidentally send the wrong message, making others think that you are being petty by focusing on divisive tactics. Winning a competition doesn't always lead to success; remember, you're all on the same team."
virgo,2014-11-23,"Balancing your innate need to have all the details in place with your current desire to dream big makes it challenging to find peace of mind. You're more intrigued to explore your creativity now without worrying whether or not your ideas will actually work. Nevertheless, you can't just toss the facts out the window. Taking enough time to acknowledge the truth before surrendering to your imagination makes you more effective in the long run. Adding a dash of pragmatism gives your fantasies a fighting chance to come true."
libra,2014-11-23,"One of your strengths is how you help colleagues feel at ease by supporting their efforts, but you might take your accommodating manner too far today without even realizing it. Unfortunately, focusing all of your attention on everyone else's needs now could impede chasing your creative pursuits. Believe it or not, giving others more freedom to succeed or fail on their own is the ultimate empowerment. Stepping back just a little frees you to make a surprisingly significant breakthrough of your own."
scorpio,2014-11-23,"You might attempt to avoid an uncomfortable feeling that's growing stronger by the day, but the only way to resolve the tension is to simply stop struggling and face it. Instead of involving others in your unfolding emotional melodrama, make an effort to find a spiritual solution to your dilemma first. Losing your temper won't bring anyone closer to happiness. Working toward your long-term goals reconnects you with what matters most to your heart."
sagittarius,2014-11-23,"Rolling with a few surprises today is a piece of cake. Luckily, your cheerful resilience enables you to deal with one noisy distraction after another. Although the Moon is in your sign, her collaboration with intellectual Uranus empowers you to display your brilliance while intuitively responding to an emotional drama. Just remember, you don't always have to be rational. It's sweeter to escape into your dreams for a while if you know you'll be pulled back into reality by tomorrow."
capricorn,2014-11-23,"You dont want to reveal your new plan yet and your somber attitude might be an effective cover for your current optimism. Thankfully, you can rely on your natural organizational skills to throw everyone off track. They are focused on your external efforts while you are free to buzz away in your imagination. Keep up outer appearances while you embark on your spiritual journey. Your inner work is rejuvenating for your soul and will fuel your ambitions for days to come."
aquarius,2014-11-23,"You could be living in a dream world today, where you believe that everything is perfectly harmonious between you and your network of friends and family. However, you might be in a state of denial now as you ignore a rift that has recently grown between you and others. Instead of sticking your head in the sand, let your feelings flow to the surface. Remaining free of judgment permits any ill will to dissipate naturally. Staying in touch with your heart inspires everyone else to do the same."
pisces,2014-11-23,"Your friends may seek out your wise counsel today because your view of the future rises above differences of opinion and petty interpersonal politics. Maybe it's because you are just being too vague to commit to one position or another. However, it's more likely that your perspective has grown into a cosmic one, and you have chosen the moral high road. Don't be coerced into taking sides now. In the midst of emotional drama, play out your role of mediator with integrity and grace. Demonstrating your compassion saves the day."
aries,2014-11-24,"You're motivated to get ahead in your career now, but your ambitions may be so strong that you forget to check in with your friends to solicit their support. Although you don't actually need the approval of others when making your plans, it's still wise to seek feedback from those you trust the most. There's no rush to act immediately so take plenty of time to build your case or you might find yourself so far out on a limb that there's no easy way back."
taurus,2014-11-24,"Although the future should be a logical extension of the past, your current trajectory could be slightly off-target. The good news is you continue to gain clarity about your destination while the Capricorn Moon plods through your 9th House of Future Vision. However, you might discover that your chosen path isn't leading you to the exact place you want to go. It may not be the best time to shift directions, but it surely can't hurt to start planning for the upcoming changes. Dream big but keep your feet on the ground."
gemini,2014-11-24,"You may grow uncomfortable today if a close friend or lover asks you too many annoying questions about your relationship. You might sidestep a direct interrogation about your motives by not answering with a definitive yes or no; however, it's not easy to maintain ambiguity now that the pragmatic Capricorn Moon is traveling through your 8th House of Deep Sharing. You can't evade making a decision any longer, so share your thoughts out loud and then put your words into action. There's no way around it; following your heart requires taking a risk."
cancer,2014-11-24,"You want to strengthen your emotional connection with a special someone today, but you might not be as available if your partner is too demanding. In fact, you could be in such a rational state of mind now that it's hard to show any vulnerability. Your best move may be to retreat so you can reconnect with your feelings before engaging in an intense conversation. Reestablishing your spiritual center empowers you to be truly authentic and speak from your heart."
leo,2014-11-24,"Your direct approach can be a bit intimidating to someone who is less dynamic than you, causing you to rethink your current strategy. It's challenging to see a problem before it arises, and beating around the bush isn't your preferred style. Nevertheless, a bit of self-restraint is in order now. Ultimately, controlling your anger and acting in a diplomatic manner will help you to get what you want.  Respect is a two-way street."
virgo,2014-11-24,"You can tap into a rich source of creativity today, but you must seek a sensible method to integrate your imagination into your day or you won't have much to show for your efforts. Instead of attempting to capture a sudden burst of genius, try to find a groove that's comfortable enough to sustain. But you might overdo your current need for self-expression before you know it. Even if you want to impress others with your cleverness, don't forget that being productive is still your ultimate goal."
libra,2014-11-24,"You aren't easily distracted by frivolous activities today and won't likely join your friends unless you believe they are participating in a worthwhile cause. Even if you would prefer to have fun, the earthy Capricorn Moon's presence in your 4th House of Roots reminds you to stay grounded at all times. Your serious attitude turns you into a harsh judge if someone pushes you too hard. However, stating your needs clearly helps you get along with others and even have a lovely time in the process."
scorpio,2014-11-24,"You need to decide what you're willing to give in return for what you want before sitting down at the negotiating table today. But keep in mind that you won't progress very far if you expect something for nothing. You could end up sabotaging your best efforts if you are too self-serving, so it's a smarter strategy to work toward a mutually beneficial outcome where everyone emerges a winner. It's less complicated to adjust your behavior preemptively than to deal with the consequences down the road."
sagittarius,2014-11-24,"Although you may want to share your dreams with friends, you are fully aware of how unrealistic some of your thoughts could sound. But it's not a simple task to set your boundaries if you slip into an argument with someone who responds negatively. Remember, your imagination holds the seeds for your future and there's no need to convince anyone that your fantasies could really come true. Just say what's on your mind and then get down to business. Your success might just surprise everyone, including yourself."
capricorn,2014-11-24,"You could end up with more trouble than you bargained for today. Although you often keep your emotions under wrap, they could quickly rise to the surface now that the evocative Moon is in your sign. The slightest provocation might elicit a flood of passion that stems from your defense against someone who makes you feel insecure. Thankfully, your current position isn't as precarious as it seems, so don't overstate your case. Take a few deep breaths and let your unwarranted anxieties dissipate before you respond."
aquarius,2014-11-24,"The more someone attempts to convince you to talk today, the less interested you are in revealing your secrets. Fortunately, you're quite capable of holding your ground, even if a very persuasive person is trying to coerce you to spill the beans. No one can force you to share anything that you choose to keep to yourself -- so politely decline to answer and just change the topic of conversation to something that's more in line with your current goals. Switching the focus alleviates the pressure and gently reminds others to back off and give you some space."
pisces,2014-11-24,"Everyone seems to have a distinct set of desires today, complicating your life with contradictory alternatives. You might be overly confident about your ability to navigate through the current emotional maze, but you can't please everyone no matter how hard you try. Nevertheless, you won't be deterred from jumping in to help while the Moon visits your 11th House of Friends and Associates. Don't hide your motives; it's better to be honest, even if it triggers a disagreement in the process. Transparency is your secret to success."
aries,2014-11-25,"Although you may decide to suppress your desires now, it's only because you realize that sharing them could create more problems. You have a good sense of what is real and you are moved to talk your walk today. You might not be sure how to proceed, but this isn't a valid reason for inaction. You must speak the truth that previously existed only within your imagination. People will be more likely to engage you honestly if you can push past your fears and express what's in your heart."
taurus,2014-11-25,"You wish that all your relationship dreams could come true, but this may not be possible now. Fortunately, you can still be happy with your current lot in life since you prefer knowing the unvarnished truth than wandering around lost in a fantasy. But awareness works in both directions and it's your responsibility to communicate honestly, even if your message is a difficult one. Although you might feel as if you're engaged in an uphill battle, the climb is well worth the effort. A heart-to-heart talk with a close friend or lover sets the stage for future happiness."
gemini,2014-11-25,"You are preoccupied with your thoughts today, but it may be difficult to keep your mind on the sunny side of the street. Your key planet Mercury joins karmic Saturn, making you an intellectual force with which to be reckoned. Instead of falling back on your clever wit, use your considerable communication skills to dig into the mysteries hidden in the shadows. Although you might want to make light of a heavy situation, Saturn expects you to be serious when it comes to maintaining your integrity."
cancer,2014-11-25,"If you find yourself stuck in an emotional funk today, you might believe there's no easy way out. Your current situation could be bothering you enough now that it is apparent to everyone around you. There's no need to pretend when it comes to your inner process. Those who love you don't want you to hide; they want to know the real you. Taking a risk and sharing what's in your heart may seem like a scary thing to do but it's the only way to deepen a meaningful relationship."
leo,2014-11-25,"An intense wave of self-awareness washes over you today, but the results are uncharacteristically sobering. It's not that you have lost your legendary confidence; it's just that you're not feeling very lighthearted now. Your natural tendency is to downplay negativity, but that could just make things worse. A more radical approach is in order. Invite someone special inside for a peek into your private world. Revealing your vulnerability is not the easiest path, but it could lead to the biggest transformation."
virgo,2014-11-25,"You might not know whether to stand on your soapbox and shout your truth or grit your teeth, swallow hard and keep quiet. Either way, you may wish you took a different route as your key planet Mercury bumps into Saturn's finality. There is no magical solution but you have to decide whether you can run with your ideas now or should acquiesce to someone in control. The answer to this dilemma is not as straightforward as it seems. The wisest strategy is to simply live with this paradox for a while longer. In the meantime, count your blessings; try not to take life so seriously."
libra,2014-11-25,"You're not willing to bury your feelings today just to keep the peace. You Libras are known for your innate diplomatic skills and your natural propensity for putting the needs of others in front of your own. However, a close friend or family member might push you too far, prompting you to do some serious thinking as you reshuffle your priorities. You are at a tipping point; channel your emotional intensity into clarifying your position and then take a stand. Speak your truth and let the chips fall as they may."
scorpio,2014-11-25,"It's all too easy to work yourself into a corner today as heavy Saturn leans on mental Mercury in your sign. Thankfully, you intuitively realize that you have the power to manifest the changes that are needed no matter how much effort it requires. Your self-criticism and self-judgment aren't productive now -- nor are they necessary. You are only restrained by the limitations of your own thoughts rather than by external circumstances. Give yourself new options by simply opening your mind."
sagittarius,2014-11-25,"You may be secretly struggling against the lessons that taskmaster Saturn is teaching you now. The good news is the hardest work is probably already completed. The time for scheming is over; whatever you do today establishes the direction for your next journey. Although you might erroneously believe that you must show progress toward your goals, forward movement isn't necessarily part of your current curriculum. Instead, accept the temporary restrictions being placed on your plans while sticking to your convictions."
capricorn,2014-11-25,"You might be resigned to tear down any walls that are currently standing between you and your goals. You know that you're capable of reaching your destination, but you're tired of being the one who bears the final responsibility. For once, you wish you could just let it all fall apart. Rest assured that common sense will come to your rescue while mental Mercury works in tandem with your key planet Saturn today. Proceed with determination instead of aggression for the best results."
aquarius,2014-11-25,"Your out-of-the box strategy for success may not be as effective as you think today. Instead of drawing attention to what makes you different, surprise everyone by demonstrating your ability to collaborate in a conventional manner. Although you might not get away with being eccentric now, you can break the mold of someone's expectations by cheerfully adapting to the current situation. But don't restrain your creativity any more than is necessary or you could lose your edge of brilliance."
pisces,2014-11-25,"If you are shouldering an emotional burden, you have a rare chance to finally release whatever is bothering you now. It's just not worth holding on to all your imagined worries that are based upon painful failures or old hurts. Being unnecessarily fearful is not helpful and only prevents you from feeling the love that is waiting for you just on the other side of a wall. All you have to do is open the door and let it in. Don't limit your future by clinging to your past."
aries,2014-11-26,"You're lured very close to the edge of an emotional cliff today and you're probably ready to jump, even if you recognize the potential danger of such unorthodox behavior. Fortunately, there's a bit of planetary magic working in your favor now and somehow, gravity might not pull you crashing down to the ground. Share your thoughts or feelings with someone you trust. You may be pleasantly surprised by where the conversation leads if you're willing to take a leap of faith."
taurus,2014-11-26,"You often take a practical approach to love, but today your thoughts are enticing you to explore unconventional possibilities that are thrilling to imagine. Luckily, you're in an experimental mood and are eager to connect with someone in a radically different way. But don't venture too far too fast unless you're sure that you really want to go there. Traveling outside of your social orbit is wonderful as long as you don't get lost in space."
gemini,2014-11-26,"You are attracted to weird ideas and unusual people like a fly to honey today. You might even find yourself somewhere you've never been and wonder how you got there. You don't have the luxury of recycling your same old fantasies now; familiar territory just won't hold your attention. Enjoy playing on a new social playground, but watch for signs along the path or you could have a difficult time navigating your way back home."
cancer,2014-11-26,"Although you have high hopes about accomplishing a lot of work, save the self-judgment for another day if you're distracted by interpersonal intrigue and don't reach your goals. Rather than setting yourself up for disappointment, consider declaring a personal holiday, instead. Define your own routine without trying to fulfill everyone else's expectations. Meeting your basic obligations today doesn't mean you have to give up the special connection you have with your own dreams."
leo,2014-11-26,"It begins to dawn on you today that your desire for freedom isn't just some passing fancy. Although you might have twinges of nostalgia for a time when your world was less complicated, the future looks brighter now than your past. An unconventional person may be encouraging you to take a chance by embarking on an adventure. But even if there's travel ahead, the real journey comes from opening your heart to the idea of something new and wildly different."
virgo,2014-11-26,Your emotions may conflict with your logic once the moody Moon shifts into your 6th House of Details. But attempts at resolving the tension won't necessarily bring you satisfaction because you're being pulled in two directions today. Trust your instincts and take a chance on following your gut reaction. You can always reconsider your priorities in a couple of days when your cool-headed analysis kicks back in and your common sense returns.
libra,2014-11-26,"You wish you could believe what others tell you, but you may realize that someone is stretching the truth today. Ironically, a little white lie doesn't bother you much now as long as you like what you're being told. Anyway, you might try to hide your feelings because you're drawn to things out of the ordinary. Nevertheless, flirty Venus harmonizes with quirky Uranus, so taking the extra step and sharing your fantasy can be fun. Nearly anything is possible as long as you don't get hung up on unnecessary details."
scorpio,2014-11-26,"At first glance your escape plan appears to be in order today, but reality may not support your optimistic conclusions. Nevertheless, you can break out of the mold you're stuck in by imagining your life drastically different than it is now. Although you might want to manifest your vision right away, accept the fact that it's going to take time. Instead of feeling frustrated about being caught between two worlds, give yourself permission to enjoy your fantasy in the moment. Practice patience; the next phase of your journey is just around the bend."
sagittarius,2014-11-26,"Your fantasies become irresistible as they grow more complex and less likely to come true. But your current desires might be leading you down a totally unfamiliar path and the closer you get to the end, the more uncertain you are about your choice. There is a fine line between your unbridled imagination and what's actually possible now. Fortunately, if you're willing to let your thoughts roam and then trust where they take you, you could actually manifest the impossible dream."
capricorn,2014-11-26,"You ambitious Mountain Goats are known for your down-to-earth practicality, and normally you competently manage the details of your life as needed. But now you're more interested in dreaming about a quick escape than taking care of the business at hand. Although you're not entirely convinced that abandoning your commitments is wise, you should be able to get away with letting a few things slide today. Thankfully, if you have been responsible all along, you can rest on your laurels, cut loose and have some fun."
aquarius,2014-11-26,"This can be a perfect day to fall in love with someone, whether or not you're on the lookout for romance. Magnetic Venus connects with your key planet Uranus, electrifying your nervous system with natural charisma and irrepressible desires. There's no need to worry about losing stability now; it's merely the possible thrill that captures your attention. However, it's still not advisable to act on every impulse. As boring as it sounds, consider the consequences before doing something you might later regret."
pisces,2014-11-26,"If you could casually slip into another dimension now, the sky would be filled with rainbows, unicorns would be frolicking and your favorite music would be playing. Happily, today's imaginative Sun-Neptune square means you don't have to travel to a parallel universe for your maximum pleasure. Everything desirable seems as if it's right around the next corner, even if you never actually get there. Instead of trying to make all your dreams come true in the moment, pick the most amazing one and strive to manifest it over the days ahead."
aries,2014-11-27,"Putting your calendar in order sounds like a sensible thing to do today, but it may be challenging to follow through with your original plans when so many people seem to want a piece of your day. You wish you could placate all involved, but your good intentions aren't enough to fit everything into place. Managing potential scheduling conflicts requires your undivided attention, yet your vivid imagination can still interfere with your ability to focus. Enjoy the company of others the best you can without trying to please everyone except yourself."
taurus,2014-11-27,"Although your relatives might not understand your unpredictable behavior now, they are willing to put up with it until they determine if your plan is worth supporting. However, your current impatience seems out of place since no one else is in a hurry. Paradoxically, you wouldn't appear so rushed if you were feeling more confident; time is running out and you don't want to be left behind. There's no need to waste words; just work diligently toward reaching satisfaction and let events unfold at their own pace."
gemini,2014-11-27,"Everyone seems to be talking up a storm today, but no one has the time to really listen. You have important things to say, but aren't sure how to work your newly formed ideas into the flow. Don't give up; your smartest strategy now is to let someone prattle on about a personal interest and then politely change the subject when the conversation lulls. Carefully choosing your words encourages others to do the same."
cancer,2014-11-27,"You are lulled into a surreal mental space today, but the emotionally detached Aquarius Moon inspires you to use your intellect to interpret the mysterious symbols of your dreams. However, this logical approach may be a dead-end strategy because rational analysis won't likely uncover any hidden meanings. Instead, set your imagination free and you'll remember what your subconscious mind is trying to tell you when you least expect it."
leo,2014-11-27,"You don't want to be distracted by anyone now because you're trying to figure out how to navigate the current time crunch. Ultimately, you can create additional stress by concentrating on the future before you respond to a more immediate situation first. Thankfully, the conceptual Aquarius Moon's visit to your 7th House of Partners brings people into your life who believe they have the answers you seek. The good news is that being receptive to the brilliance of others could improve your game without slowing down your progress."
virgo,2014-11-27,"You want to be an integral part of the social activities today but you don't like leaving a project only partially completed. Thankfully, you can be quite methodical, enabling you to finish just in the nick of time. But you may have to let a few details fall to the wayside. Eliminating non-essential tasks frees you up to proactively address a potential problem, rather than waiting for it to turn into a minor disaster. Setting priorities early on and sticking to them is the key to your success."
libra,2014-11-27,"Living in your dreamworld was fine for a little escape, but it's time to reclaim your power now by telling others what you want. Nevertheless, it's not a good idea to let your personal preferences stand in the way of your enjoyment today. However, you can keep your destination in mind while still relaxing into the flow of the day's events. Recheck your GPS tomorrow and then recalculate your route if necessary."
scorpio,2014-11-27,"You won't be satisfied with social pleasantries today unless they connect you with your friends and relatives on a deeper emotional level. However, your manner of expressing your needs can sound overly complex to others, prompting them to make a hasty retreat. Although your desires could be thwarted by someone who has a very different agenda than you, don't try to convince anyone else to adopt your perspective. The more you sell your point of view, the less chance there is for finding compromise. Oddly enough, respecting the opinions of others leads to the intimacy you seek."
sagittarius,2014-11-27,"You may believe you have a practical strategy to complete your chores before indulging in any holiday festivities today. However, your idealistic solution might fall apart once you start executing your plans. You could underestimate how much time a job will take, or maybe you discover that you're missing an important tool. Either way, working faster isn't the answer. Ironically, you'll finish sooner if you slow down your pace, leaving you with plenty of breathing room before the fun begins."
capricorn,2014-11-27,"Social obligations are like the fly in your ointment today. You want to spend quality time with friends and family, but you resent the fact that they expect you to contribute to the day in specific ways. Your personal needs may diverge from those of the group, creating a gulf between you and others. Don't let your unresolved anxieties or unsatisfied desires prevent you from feeling the love. Count your blessings and express your gratitude while you have the chance."
aquarius,2014-11-27,"You seem to be attracted to nearly anything that allows you to lose yourself into a crowd today. But you won't be able to run away from your problems since you just keep bumping into the same issues again and again. Rather than trying to sidestep a difficult emotional dynamic, just stay fully present with your feelings. You might be pleasantly surprised by what happens when you're willing to demonstrate your emotional vulnerability."
pisces,2014-11-27,"Reality is giving you permission now to luxuriate in the rich symbolism of your imagination. Of course, you're no stranger to the act of invisibly slipping behind the veil of consciousness. However, putting your dreams to work today is more complicated than it seems. Thankfully, you don't have to make your next move yet;  just let your mind wander without any specific agenda. Instead of pushing to further your personal vision, celebrate the camaraderie you share with those you love."
aries,2014-11-28,"You're willing to join in the celebration as long as your future is looking bright; just make sure your imagination isn't playing tricks on you now. It's not necessarily a good strategy to focus all your energy on the possibilities ahead while there is still plenty of work to be done in the present moment. The most intelligent course of action is to take care of your current obligations without getting distracted by gambling on things to come. Tomorrow doesn't come with a guarantee, so make the most of today."
taurus,2014-11-28,"A radically new approach looks good on paper because you realize that the same old plan won't help you reach your goals. However, you're still tempted to play it safe since your fear of failure encourages maintaining the status quo. Nevertheless, you accomplish more if you overcome self-doubt and take a calculated risk. Don't let an important opportunity slip through your fingers; seize the moment and run."
gemini,2014-11-28,"You may be feeling quite clever as you tap dance around a decision in order to get out of making a commitment. Like it or not, concentrating on a singular goal could be your best possible move today. Normally, you excel at keeping multiple options open so you can wait until the very last moment before picking one. However, the sooner you choose now, the better your chances of success."
cancer,2014-11-28,"You're so captivated by your fantasies today that your actual experiences may fall short of your expectations. But living in your dreamworld could create emotional distance between you and those you love. You really don't want to isolate yourself; you just need more breathing room now. Temporarily retreating is easier than confronting reality if you are unhappy with a current situation. However, you can learn a significant truth about your heart by leaning into your fears instead of avoiding them."
leo,2014-11-28,"You may plan on sailing through calm waters today, but there's still an intense storm brewing on the horizon. Fortunately, you can prepare yourself so you won't be caught off guard when the winds whip up and the seas grow rough. Actually, you're almost eager for an opportunity to show off your high level of competency. Ultimately, if you don't become complacent, this unexpected challenge can raise your profile and boost your self-confidence."
virgo,2014-11-28,"Normally, organizing details is the fuel to your fire, helping you achieve your goals in an efficient manner. However, you may be weary of always having to be the practical one and you long for your imagination to lift you out of your current rut. However, it could be quite challenging to bring your grandiose visions down to earth today. Luckily, you can make magic now if you give yourself permission to be creative without worrying about the results."
libra,2014-11-28,You're itching to find new avenues of self-expression now with the non-conformist Aquarius Moon hanging out in your 5th House of Creativity. But it's possible to be so driven to tell your story that you appear uncharacteristically inattentive to the needs of others. The stressful Moon-Mercury square makes it difficult for you to say the right thing and your message might be misinterpreted. Sharing your truth is an admirable ambition as long as you balance the give and take. Listen as much as you talk.
scorpio,2014-11-28,"Your opinions are highly intuitive today but you can't necessarily back them up with tangible facts. You must be careful how you express your feelings because it's easy to put so much intensity into every word that others mistake your passion for anger. Nevertheless, focusing on the bigger picture frees you from any perceived negativity. Allowing for a variety of personal preferences now connects you with a more spiritual vision that inspires those around you."
sagittarius,2014-11-28,"You sound so wise to others today that you can amaze them with your philosophical thoughts. But turning your powerful visions into something solid is impossible, especially if you're dashing off to explore the next great idea the moment after you share the previous one. Trying to prove your intelligence could backfire now if you don't take sufficient time to apply some common sense to your thinking. Actions speak louder than words."
capricorn,2014-11-28,"You may seem to have a laissez-faire attitude about your obligations today, but you're not nearly as disengaged as you appear. It's just that you are trying to balance your worldly ambitions with more spiritual pursuits. The problem is that you need some quiet time for contemplation; self-reflection inspires you to be more sympathetic to other people's needs. This compassionate spirit magnifies the good feelings between you and your associates, enabling you to accomplish even more in the long run."
aquarius,2014-11-28,"You're highly motivated to be productive today, yet you also want to take time and enjoy the camaraderie between you and others. However, traversing this territory can be tricky, since it's harder to maintain a healthy perspective on your goals if you lose your objectivity. It's nearly impossible now to know exactly where to draw the line between work and play. Ask someone you trust for advice, but make sure you heed the feedback you receive to save yourself from regret."
pisces,2014-11-28,"Your vivid imagination often guides you better than the facts, but you need to be very careful about blindly following your intuition today. Take time to corroborate your hunches with someone in authority or you might discover that you missed an important piece of information. Your inner world is still a significant source of inspiration; just remember to perform a reality check before jumping to any erroneous conclusions. Backing up your instincts with irrefutable logic is a winning formula."
aries,2014-11-29,"You are ready for a change in direction in order to increase your chances of reaching your long-term goals. You might even plan a retreat to contemplate your options, especially if you have been burning the candles at both ends. Making time for solitude now may be challenging but it's a wise move. Oddly enough, the more complicated it is to schedule a bit of downtime, the more you need it. Listen to your inner voice of inspiration to find the answers you seek."
taurus,2014-11-29,"Although you may be quite comfortable working alone, participating in a group activity might be exactly what you need now. You are able to strengthen your conviction in your individual objectives if you share your vision with like-minded people. But it's easy to get swept up in a cause that's larger than your own. Remember, contributing as an integral member of a team is admirable, but it could backfire if you sacrifice your personal goals in the process. Maintain a healthy perspective for the best results."
gemini,2014-11-29,"You could run into resistance today, but it's hard to put your finger on the source of the problem. You might be afraid that you'll lose your sense of identity if you take other people's feelings to heart. But you're able to hold your ground now better than you think. The obstacles to your success will begin to dissipate if you stay on the same track without spending too much time questioning the intelligence of your chosen path. Trust that your inner guide won't steer you wrong."
cancer,2014-11-29,"You are eager to immerse yourself into the refreshing deep sea of emotions, but others might not want to join you in your underwater adventure. Today's watery Pisces Moon is an antidote for your recent emotional detachment. Your parched soul is now able to reconnect with what's important and unexpected rewards are yours if you're willing to dig for sunken treasure on your own. Exploring your feelings may feel lonely at first but it's worth it in the long run."
leo,2014-11-29,"You take pride in being known as the life of the party, but the Moon's visit to your 8th House of Intimacy reveals a much deeper facet of your personality. You're currently motivated to raise complicated issues that lack quick and easy solutions. However, expressing your heartfelt desires today can lead to profound discussions that intensify an important relationship. Initiating an honest dialogue allows others to get to know the real you."
virgo,2014-11-29,"You may grow annoyed if no one seems to be working as diligently as you. The Moon's visit to your 7th House of Others emphasizes all aspects of your partnerships today, but your obsession with the details might be perceived as unsolicited criticism. It's not helpful to try to solve anyone's problems or attempt to change someone who falls short of your expectations. Instead, make room in your heart for all the imperfections that you see in those around you and allow them to be human. Looking through the eyes of love inspires you to see the best in everyone."
libra,2014-11-29,"You have several projects to do around the house today, but you're unsure of the best way to get started. You might think that making a list will help you focus, but even that could prove to be a daunting task. Although over-planning your day is tempting, it's wiser to stay flexible and take everything one step at a time. Don't judge yourself harshly if you're not making a lot of visible progress now. Trust the process; sometimes the most important things are the ones you cannot see."
scorpio,2014-11-29,"Finding pleasure is a top priority while the Moon travels through your 5th House of Enjoyment, but you experience conflict between your desires and your values. Luckily, your private matters need not interfere with your outer world today if you can effectively manage your emotions. Although you often struggle as you try to separate your head from your heart, staying in touch with your feelings now enables you to process them internally, without others having to know your personal business. Keep the peace by sharing on a need-to-know basis only."
sagittarius,2014-11-29,"Your cheerful facade successfully hides tears and fears from other people's view today but you still might feel overwhelmed because you can't seem to fully control your emotions. Your first inclination is to avoid conversations that stir hurtful memories rather than trying to process your feelings. However, you may experience welcome relief if you express what's in your heart. Although a quick fix is unlikely, gradual resolution is possible once everyone knows where you stand."
capricorn,2014-11-29,"The more you struggle to regain control over your schedule today, the harder it is to keep everything on track. However, all is not lost if satisfaction is elusive. There's no need to fret because you're likely better off than you realize. Nevertheless, it could take a few days yet to appreciate how much progress you have already made. Focus on the big picture now; you are running a marathon, not a sprint."
aquarius,2014-11-29,"Financial issues can give you a headache today if there are so many choices to make that you don't know which way to turn. Fiscal matters are further complicated if your top advisers are offering conflicting strategies today. You might need to set aside all the facts, stop the endless analysis and just follow whatever you feel in your gut. Don't bother justifying your decisions now; simply do what your instincts suggest and let the cards fall where they may."
pisces,2014-11-29,"Your behavior could be confusing to others today, especially if they expect you to act in a rational manner. But the Moon's monthly visit to your sign increases your unpredictability because your feelings are in the process of changing. Meanwhile, lunar squares to the Sun and Venus heighten the dynamic conflict between your inner and outer worlds now. However, there's no need to fake objectivity for the sake of everyone else. Swimming in the waters of your imagination makes you one happy Fish."
aries,2014-11-30,"You might not know what to do with the brilliant ideas that pop into your head today. Ironically, friends and coworkers grow less convinced that your approach is valid the more you try to explain it. They may agree with your position in theory, but they're not sure you can transform your clever strategy into a practical plan. It won't help to ramble on about your vision for the future. Save your long speeches for another day; for now, lead with actions rather than words. Success is the best revenge."
taurus,2014-11-30,"You believe you're standing on solid ground but you probably won't have such a firm grip on reality today. At first you claim that you're in control, but you are more likely to cause confusion when you contradict yourself later on. Although you can cleverly explain a complicated concept now, it's more challenging to just give simple directions. A wise person knows his limitations; let someone else temporarily take the reins until your clarity returns."
gemini,2014-11-30,"You may try to think rationally today, but it's challenging to finish sentences if your ideas drift off into the mists of illusion and fantasy. It's a struggle to stay on track now while trickster Mercury squares irrational Neptune. Your facts are fuzzy and your judgment is warped so wait a couple of days and then reconsider your options before doing anything drastic. Spend time cultivating your daydreams while you can."
cancer,2014-11-30,"It's to your advantage to clam up and remain as silent as possible today. If you practice discretion, you might just come out of a tangled emotional web appearing as if you are a real hero. Although seeing both sides of a conflict is difficult now, you still realize there are no straightforward solutions. In fact, pretending to have the answer will just create disappointment. If you have something crucial to add to the discussion, it will grow more relevant over the days ahead."
leo,2014-11-30,"It's very reassuring when you can express your creativity through your work duties or domestic chores. However, it's quite disconcerting if you cannot. Your current situation could be complicated by a close friend or coworker who isn't communicating clearly. You prefer to have the support and admiration of those around you, especially when you're trying to finalize a decision. But you don't need an adoring audience; believing in yourself is more than enough."
virgo,2014-11-30,"This is an unusual but exciting day, and you're more inclined to tell a story or write a poem than organize your plans for the holidays. You want everyone to acknowledge your efficiency, but concentrating on details requires a major commitment today. Don't set yourself up for failure by trying to deliver something beyond your current capabilities. There's nothing wrong with losing yourself in a fantasy for a while; you can always return to reality tomorrow."
libra,2014-11-30,"The Scales symbolize your innate commitment to seeking balance, even when it's nowhere to be found. You might end up spinning your wheels today if you believe you can rely on logic to locate the calm eye of the storm. But you won't reestablish your center of gravity by keeping still now. Your natural grace arises from being one with the flow rather than trying to cling to the status quo."
scorpio,2014-11-30,You're in no mood to argue with someone who seems to have all the answers since you don't feel the need to prove anything today. It's not that you would necessarily lose a fight; it's just that you recognize the wisdom of taking the high road to avoid unnecessary conflict. Communicate your facts clearly without adopting a defensive stance. Everyone can come out a winner if the competition is called off before it even gets under way.
sagittarius,2014-11-30,"You can transform a rather mundane day into a magical one if you don't attempt to resolve the dualistic way you approach life today. On one hand, you're thinking like an analytical scientist, carefully observing every situation in a cool and detached manner. But on the other hand, you're like an artist, directly engaging your experiences by responding with a wide spectrum of emotions. Each method offers something of value now; tune into your head and your heart at the same time without closing down either one."
capricorn,2014-11-30,"You want to believe that your survival instincts won't steer you wrong today. However, you may have temporarily lost your ability to separate threads that are spun in your imagination from those that are woven with reality. Normally, you are the champion of distinguishing fact from fiction, yet the fabric of life contains both. Don't over-analyze your choices; just appreciate the magic of what you can create in the present moment."
aquarius,2014-11-30,"You are moved to talk about your recent dreams, but the more you try to describe them, the less others understand. Your thoughts are elusive and don't easily fit into words, unless you have a particular spiritual discipline that inspires you to re-frame your experiences in a more positive manner. Awakening your inner artist, poet or mystic can help you understand the subtleties of your current perspective."
pisces,2014-11-30,"Unfortunately, even the most basic ideas are slippery as banana peels now. Your best bet is to put off any detailed work off until tomorrow when your concentration returns. Meanwhile, cerebral Mercury creates a dynamic square with your ruling planet Neptune, opening your imagination to worlds that exist beyond the realm of language. Instead of limiting your reality to your five senses, it's time to integrate your spiritual experiences into your everyday life."
aries,2014-12-01,"You're looking forward to starting a new project around the home today, but your efficiency may wane as you grow nearer to your final objective. Don't let delays turn your anticipation into annoyance because they won't stop you for long. Even if everything seems to be moving slowly, progress is occurring faster than you realize. Luckily, you have a rare opportunity now to create stability in the midst of dynamic change."
taurus,2014-12-01,"The emotional imbalance in personal relationships may be unsettling now, prompting you to take direct action to improve your love life. Unexpected changes to your social calendar recently put a damper on your fun. But these surprises aren't necessarily negative ones, since you can use the additional time in a variety of ways. Develop a concrete plan that gives you the opportunity to explore your creative side instead of being distracted by circumstances beyond your control. Channel your passion into your art."
gemini,2014-12-01,"If your achievements are falling short of your expectations now, stop and reconsider your plan of attack. The first step is to make sure that you're heading in the right direction. Find a comfortable place to sit quietly and think about those things most critical to you. You are pleasantly surprised when you realize how easy it is to act on your answers once you take some time for contemplation. Make a commitment to continue on your chosen path, even if you must sacrifice some independence along the way."
cancer,2014-12-01,"Perhaps you recently experienced an unusual situation involving others who were not playing according to your rules. However, you're gaining strength now as the dynamics continue to unfold, emboldening you to act in ways that have lasting impact. Trusting your intuition and making small changes help to stabilize the day even if you must go off on your own. Having faith in yourself empowers you to stand up for your convictions."
leo,2014-12-01,"Now that an emotional storm is subsiding, you must keep your eyes open wide so you can make the most of the recent lessons you learned. However, the radical solutions that you discovered last week still need to be executed with precision. Careful conservation of your resources enables you to maximize your potential for success. And as lucky as you are feeling now, there's no substitute for hard work."
virgo,2014-12-01,"If you truly want to improve your relationships, you must trust your common sense now more than ever. Unfortunately, you can mislead yourself and others today, rationalizing your half-logical conclusions to your advantage. Instead of letting your mind wander, stick closely to the facts. Moving forward with cautious optimism is the most practical way to make your wishes come true."
libra,2014-12-01,"Give everyone sufficient time to explain their ideas before you make your final judgment. You might think that someone's plan is truly crazy at first only to realize that it could be built on a solid foundation. Remain open to change, since innovative approaches to the same old problems give you a chance to create something really special. Honoring the group process takes on a magical life of its own."
scorpio,2014-12-01,"You become so fond of an idea today that you can get stuck on it. Unfortunately, your stubbornness just means that reality has to yell even louder to attract your attention. There may be financial issues brewing now that are stirring up internal conflict. Sacrificing a little personal freedom to get what you need might be the right kind of compromise. Taking care of business is your top priority if you want to set things right."
sagittarius,2014-12-01,"You are at a critical point as you strive to reach a goal, but you may be irritated if things aren't moving along fast enough. You desperately want to make something positive happen and are anxious to try a new approach if you think it will further your cause. Fortunately, your desires aren't just pipe dreams; your preoccupation with self-improvement can really take you to the next level. Although you're close to a big change, transformation won't occur unless you're willing to act on your feelings."
capricorn,2014-12-01,"Unfortunately, even the most stable structures don't seem so secure these days. The same things you depended on in the past have shifted somehow and your life isn't what it once was. It's hard to relax now but the stress could work to your advantage if it motivates you to deal with it right away. Move past your fear of the unknown because your current journey can positively influence your life for a long time to come."
aquarius,2014-12-01,"You're likely to see things from a more practical angle now that the stabilizing qualities of Saturn take control of your world. But the pioneering Aries Moon runs into your key planet Uranus this evening, shaking up the status quo and increasing the potential for freedom. At other times in your life it may have been difficult to integrate the urgency of Uranus, but you can create positive change now without experiencing undue stress. Seize the day and demonstrate your brilliance to the world."
pisces,2014-12-01,"A permanent change of direction won't come easily to you Fish since you intuitively understand that nothing is fixed in the ocean of life. However, you have a chance to initiate action now that can propel your plans forward. Making an overdue decision allows you to reestablish your reliability. But don't try to do everything all at once; it's the little adjustments that will have the most power in the long run. Everything is possible for one who believes."
aries,2014-12-02,"Oftentimes, you can run into a wall, get up and continue in the same direction as if the obstacle has mysteriously vanished. But other times a much-needed reality check stops you in your tracks. Although you are intent on reaching your destination, you may end up healthier and happier if you slow down to enjoy yourself where you are. There's no need to rush to get somewhere else; count your blessings rather than the miles ahead."
taurus,2014-12-02,"You may have high hopes about opening your heart and sharing your feelings today as the Moon harmonizes with romantic Venus and excessive Jupiter. However, someone's cold shoulder might cause you to change your mind at the last minute. Cooling your jets makes sense while stern Saturn steps into the picture. Once you consider the alternative ways to say what's on your mind, you can choose how to deliver your message and proceed with more caution than you had at first. A measured approach brings the best results."
gemini,2014-12-02,"You are so excited by all the possibilities ahead that you could lose touch with the relationship dynamics right in front of your nose. You expect so much from your friends today that they don't have a chance of living up to your high ideals. Keeping your fantasies to a minimum increases your chances of finding satisfaction. Take time to appreciate the people currently in your life, even if they fall short of your dreams. Being grateful for life's little blessings is your key to happiness."
cancer,2014-12-02,"You can work yourself up into a state of agitation today because you fear being rejected, especially if you have something significant to say. You wish you could keep your feelings to yourself so you didn't have to suffer the embarrassment of possibly overstepping someone else's boundaries. However, cultivating relationships may require you to take a risk now. Acknowledging your vulnerability is a good first step to a meaningful conversation. Your bold behavior might even surprise yourself."
leo,2014-12-02,"A plethora of big ideas are floating around in your head today, yet it might be too soon to let others in on your thought process. There are options to be considered and plenty of work still to be done. Although you may feel a strong sense of urgency to push ahead now, it's wiser to continue developing your plans and wait to take action until all the details are in place. Take your vision to the next level before expressing what's in your heart."
virgo,2014-12-02,"Your decisions are complicated by someone else's assumptions or limitations. You may be willing to move forward with a project or deepen a relationship, yet it takes two to tango. Be careful; don't fall into the trap of believing that you will persuade another person to initiate action. It's one thing to express yourself honestly, but it's something entirely different if you're doing it to elicit a desired response. The real trick is knowing how to share your feelings without getting hooked by your own expectations."
libra,2014-12-02,"You don't know what to expect now because people are acting out of character. You might be tired of trying to anticipate the reactions of friends or coworkers, prompting you to retreat and limit your communication to the essentials. Unfortunately, your self-imposed silenced can send the wrong message, making others feel as if you are rejecting them. Thankfully, this awkward tension dissipates naturally, so don't turn it into something bigger than it actually is. The best thing you can do is use this as an opportunity to initiate an honest dialogue."
scorpio,2014-12-02,"You are your own greatest enemy today if you let doubt stop you from jumping in and performing a job that you haven't done before. There isn't necessarily anything you can do to better prepare yourself for what's next. Don't waste energy trying to talk yourself out of giving it your best effort; instead, push ahead methodically without clinging to any unrealistic expectations or preconceived limitations. Achieving success starts with believing in yourself."
sagittarius,2014-12-02,"It doesn't matter if you are running behind on a job or not; everything still takes longer now than you originally planned. But don't let discouragement slow you down even more, because you can be productive enough over the next several days to make up lost ground. Rather than worrying about what you didn't do yesterday or making empty promises about tomorrow, focus on the present moment to increase your efficiency today. Sometimes the most crucial answers are the ones closest to home."
capricorn,2014-12-02,"Your resistance to distractions crumbles today as you grow increasingly bored with your current work. Although you have the ability to exert your willpower, your self-discipline is waning, especially if your friends entice you with temptations of fun. There's nothing wrong with taking some time to play now as long as you don't avoid your responsibilities in the process. Temporarily losing yourself in the crowd might be all you need to revitalize your spirit."
aquarius,2014-12-02,"Declining a social invitation may be the wisest thing to do because it's all too easy to scatter your energy today. However, you might end up working too hard with little to show for your efforts unless you make a conscious decision to follow through on what you start. Instead of evaluating all the options and imagining the best possible outcome at every turn, simply follow your intuition now. No matter how much you analyze the situation, your first hunch is probably your best bet."
pisces,2014-12-02,"Although your friends and workmates are fantastic sources of wisdom now, the financial decisions you must make are yours alone. However, you can still share your perspective as long as you don't get distracted by a temporary feel-good solution. Fortunately, integrating the advice you receive enables you to handle the underlying issue. Don't fall for the smoke-and-mirrors illusion; making a tough choice today prevents a more serious headache down the road."
aries,2014-12-03,"You may be convinced that you're right and will do nearly anything to prove your point today. Unfortunately, passion is not a viable substitute for logic. Repeating your argument in a louder voice doesn't make your position more valid than anyone else's. Rather than demonstrating your insecurity now, display your true strength by listening with an open mind to what others say so you can expand your own horizons in the process. Take the high road by showing your flexible attitude right from the start."
taurus,2014-12-03,"People may lose respect for you if you behave as if you're absolutely certain that everyone else is wrong. The Moon's return to your fixed sign encourages you to act with unwavering determination; however, you might be tempted to take your confidence too far. Extreme positions aren't useful now, so demonstrate your willingness to compromise by giving others the very same respect you wish to receive from them in return. Seeing complex issues from multiple perspectives requires a significant leap of faith but could enrich your life immeasurably, nonetheless."
gemini,2014-12-03,"You may truly believe you're being fair-minded in your interactions with others, but maintaining objectivity is trickier than you think today. Ultimately, the truth is harder to recognize when your feelings are tied up with your conclusions, making you less logical in your analysis. Just remember that your assumptions are likely to differ from someone else's, so take time to clarify your thoughts now before you find yourself embroiled in an unnecessary conflict. Life is not a matter of chance; it's a matter of choice."
cancer,2014-12-03,"Although your confidence continues to grow, you might not feel ready to share your plans with anyone else yet. If someone attempts to make you talk now, you may respond passive-aggressively by quickly pulling into your shell. However, you could lose your temper in an outpouring of pent-up emotions if you are pushed too far. Thankfully, you're not doomed to waiting until it's too late for reason. You have the authority to take control of your life and tell your story without giving up your power to anyone else."
leo,2014-12-03,"A sudden surge of optimism has you feeling like your old self today, but it still is wise to exercise caution when expressing your feelings. You're aware of your own contradictions now, and you're probably quite willing to accept them. However, your coworkers may not be as forgiving, and an emotional disclosure could stir up their insecurities. You might conclude that it's easier to keep your thoughts private for a while longer when taking all the factors into consideration. However, the longer you wait, the more complicated the dynamics grow. Take a deep breath and dive in."
virgo,2014-12-03,"Your highly refined work ethic makes doing the right thing even more difficult today. You might be hypercritical of someone who seems to be wasting your time since efficiency is usually one of your top priorities. Nevertheless, it's wise to honor everyone's personal boundaries before overreacting, for nothing is gained by telling others how to live their lives. Nobody is perfect, so focus on their strengths and not their weaknesses. Your positive attitude tends to bring the best out of everyone else."
libra,2014-12-03,"Your smooth diplomatic charm comes in handy now, especially if others are gravitating toward conflict. Your friends might be totally unaware of how close they are to a potentially harmful argument because their hearts, rather than their brains, are blindly leading them forward. Don't be afraid to intervene if you think you can help alleviate the tension today. You have a chance to play a significant role as a peaceful warrior if you're willing to get emotionally involved."
scorpio,2014-12-03,"You may have to stand firm against an adversary today, but your unflappable commitment to harmonious coexistence can turn a potentially explosive situation into an emotionally healing one. However, don't assume that you will change anyone's mind; other people are just as stubborn as you are now. Instead, alter your own attitude by making room for someone else's perspective as well as your own. Consider yourself an ambassador of peace whose mission is to inspire everyone to accept and appreciate others as they are."
sagittarius,2014-12-03,"Your current path appears to narrow today, but this constriction doesn't prevent you from focusing on the possibilities, rather than the limitations. You might believe that you're being realistic in your thinking, even if someone says you have lost touch with the facts. Nevertheless, you could squander a short-lived opportunity if you waste time worrying about the opinions of others. Your success doesn't depend on anyone else now; it's the result of your internal fortitude and relentless optimism."
capricorn,2014-12-03,"People might attempt to rain on your parade today, but you have enough positive vibes to overcome their negative energy. You don't need to plan to maintain your exuberance; your enthusiasm naturally regenerates itself now, assuming you are following your bliss. There's no reason to succumb to coercion or guilt; the more closely you are aligned with your dreams, the less reactive you are to unwarranted criticism. Don't let anyone dim your light when it's shining so brightly."
aquarius,2014-12-03,"Someone might stand between you and your fun today, and the more you try to confront the resistance, the better the odds of something going wrong. Unfortunately, nothing positive will come from a likely stalemate. Instead, employ a totally different strategy by sidestepping a brewing conflict. Since you won't receive the satisfaction of winning an argument, you might as well retreat, reduce the tension and just enjoy yourself while you can."
pisces,2014-12-03,"You are a formidable opponent once you make up your mind, and you will steadfastly defend your decision today. Often, you are quick to acquiesce, but now your legendary adaptability is nowhere to be found. Instead, your current strategy is to hold still and obstinately wait for others to come around to your position. Unfortunately, you could be missing the point if you believe there's only one acceptable answer. Meeting your adversaries halfway enables everyone to discover that you have more in common than you thought."
aries,2014-12-04,"Professional opportunities are promising, even if the background stress doesn't magically disappear. No matter how many commitments you have on your plate today, you still should be able to find time for enjoyment without slipping into denial about your responsibilities. You are in an energetic flow and have a wonderful ability now to shine in the present moment. Use your gift wisely while keeping one eye on the future instead of just frittering away your day."
taurus,2014-12-04,"You have everything in place to create a magical day, so take the good times as they come now. However, there's no reason to be overly concerned about what's around the bend. Focus your energy on practical ways to make your life more bountiful. You deserve to be happy, so soak in the positive vibrations while you can. The love you take is equal to the love you make."
gemini,2014-12-04,"An unusual constellation of events could pull you into an emotional exchange today. Although you might choose to lightheartedly avoid this type of interaction at other times, you're currently more than ready to express what's in your heart. Luckily, your exploration of unfamiliar territory might surprise you with more joy than you expect. But it's not just about the pleasure principle; connecting with others now rejuvenates your spirit and gives you something to think about for a long time to come."
cancer,2014-12-04,"Although you may be surfing waves of unexpressed feelings, they're not strong enough to tear you away from the sweeter side of life. However, your fear of change could prevent you from having the most memorable experience possible. Remain open to the love that is around you, even if you are wary of it morphing into something different from what you ultimately desire. Instead of wasting precious energy resisting the inevitable, jump in and enjoy the ride as the currents carry you along."
leo,2014-12-04,"Good news already is heading your way, but you must be receptive or it might pass you by unnoticed. Romantic love is possible, but the rewards may be less emotional now than practical. You might even be lucky enough to receive an unexpected cash windfall. Whatever the benefits, don't expect them to last. Everything can feel wonderful as long as you don't try to hold on to the moment. The magic of today is magnified by your non-possessive attitude. As William Blake counsels, ""Kiss the joy as it flies."""
virgo,2014-12-04,"There's no use to stress about your inconvenient attractions today; you might as well go ahead and express them. Although emotional disclosure isn't your strong suit, chances are you feel secure enough now to take more of a chance with your heart. However, the problem is that once you begin to share today, it's all too easy to just keep going. Start slowly by stirring up whatever seems most stuck. Once the conversation is rolling along, don't resist the flow. Trust the wisdom of the moment to safely lead you to the satisfaction you seek."
libra,2014-12-04,"There is magic in the air today and whatever happens has an excellent chance of turning out for the best. Your key planet, sweet Venus, is harmonizing with permissive Jupiter, encouraging you to follow a path of indulgence. But don't waste this powerful planetary boost by just idly sitting around, eating candy and letting this magnificent day float by. Take a chance and share the beauty that lives in your dreams; pursuing creative communication opens a whole new world to your imagination."
scorpio,2014-12-04,"Your emotional awareness often holds the keys to your happiness. However, achieving material success can be a more immediate problem from time to time. Today, the two are linked; do whatever makes you feel good about yourself and the money could follow. Adhering to your strong sense of values is the glue that holds your plans together. Taking a risk improves your shot at success, but everything could fall apart if you overreach your mark."
sagittarius,2014-12-04,"Your key planet Jupiter receives a rejuvenating boost of love from flirty Venus now. Even if you're having a tough time getting into the holiday spirit, it's nearly impossible to remain in a negative place today. The good news is that others are more likely to be cheerful while in your presence. They might seek you out, putting you on the most wanted list -- not for punishment, but rather for fun and games. Enjoy the heightened notoriety and kick up your heels while it lasts."
capricorn,2014-12-04,"A luxurious sense of satisfaction temporarily releases you from a stressful situation. Your coworkers and superiors see you as more graceful and charming today, and your ability to encourage others magically comes back to you. Your people skills are supported by your intuition now and ability to discern the truth. Channel your positive energy into collaborative efforts, and if others want to join in your cause -- let them."
aquarius,2014-12-04,"If you bump into instant karma today, reality will likely rule in your favor. However, it's not wise to push your luck too far. Unfortunately, if you attempt to take unfair advantage of anyone, the unpleasant reaction may be immediate. It's smarter to simply receive the love that's being offered now, without trying to turn it into anything more. Find satisfaction in what you have, rather than longing for something that is always just out of your reach."
pisces,2014-12-04,"If unexpected events recently shocked you awake, it's time to loosen up and relax again. Enjoy your new found freedom by being appreciative to the positive reinforcement and encouragement that is coming your way. Be grateful about any blessings, material or emotional, that you receive today. Opportunity may be knocking, but remember that it is still incumbent upon you to open the door and let it in."
aries,2014-12-05,"You can feel it in your bones that something quite wonderful is going to happen. Although you don't not know what it is yet, you might anticipate the magic in every cell of your body. Even if you're ready to stir up the excitement, remember to discuss your intentions with others before including them in your crazy plans. Your friends may not be as eager for the same level of drama. A little sensitivity to everyone else's needs goes a long way toward making the most of this special moment."
taurus,2014-12-05,"You're unable to get fully comfortable today and your restlessness doesn't help anyone else relax either. Your anxiety stems mostly from what you aren't saying now. However, it's not productive to pretend that all is well if you wish you were doing something else. Remember, the first step to making others happy is to speak your truth. Your real friends will support your journey as you break out of your shell and live an authentic life."
gemini,2014-12-05,"The constant rumbling of excitement rattles your nerves today. It's challenging to sit still because you want to physically move in resonance with your hyperactive mind. You have an endless string of clever ideas and witty remarks now, but the day will end with little to show for all your brilliance unless you narrow your focus. Channel your creativity wisely and use your boundless energy to perform random acts of kindness."
cancer,2014-12-05,"Although you're normally afraid of losing control, you may have an uncharacteristic attraction to the rush of adrenaline today. You're up for almost anything, and if nothing exciting is going on, then you might surprise others when you step forward as the instigator. Obstacles fall to the wayside as you dance into a day filled with fun. Your enthusiasm is contagious so make the world a better place by spreading your joy everywhere you go."
leo,2014-12-05,"You seem to be orbiting in the cosmic flow today. Others see your light shining brightly and assume that all is right in your world. However, behind the scenes your emotions are agitated and there's pandemonium even if everything appears placid on the surface. This kind of intensity might normally be overwhelming, but now you are eager to shoot the rapids of the emotional white waters. Grab your metaphorical kayak and start paddling while the currents are traveling in your direction."
virgo,2014-12-05,"You want your coworkers to have fun today and you're willing to expend an extraordinary level of energy to accomplish this goal. This could be a very socially exciting day, so make the most of it by doing something outside of your regular routine. Your approach to life is more unconventional than usual, shaking up your perspective and taking you far beyond your comfort zone. Shine your light of love and good vibrations will reflect back in return."
libra,2014-12-05,"Whether people expect you to be the event planner or the peacemaker for the group, you aren't interested in playing your regular role of keeping everyone happy today. You prefer your day to be without unnecessary social responsibilities and could go to great lengths to make your point. Even if you don't want to upset others, at least tell them what you need. And don't act too surprised when you receive unexpected support from an unusual source. Sometimes being true to yourself works out for the best."
scorpio,2014-12-05,"Navigating a course between your need for a quiet retreat and your desire to partake in the scheduled festivities is a delicate balancing act today. Your friends want to spend more time with you now, since you have such a unique perspective to offer to the group. Don't write off any social engagements just because you think they will distract you from your inner work. The creative juice you receive from others gives you something magical that solitude doesn't."
sagittarius,2014-12-05,"Participating in group activities enables you to accomplish more today, but you might have to pay too steep of an emotional price if you try to take charge. Of course, working as a part of a team can also be fun and immensely rewarding. Nevertheless, you have a rebellious streak encouraging you to break loose and demonstrate your own unique individuality. However, striking out on your own isn't the best answer now. Calm down; allow others to plan the details and set the pace. All you need to do is show up and smile."
capricorn,2014-12-05,"Leave your sense of duty behind so you can let your hair down and relax. Taking this apparently irresponsible path may be challenging because you Goats typically work hard and aspire to greatness, but you truly deserve a break today. Forget about your previous accomplishments and don't worry about tomorrow's list of chores. Just ride the exhilarating wave of enthusiasm now; following your bliss restores your spirit and spices up your life."
aquarius,2014-12-05,"Your nerves are dancing to an exhilarating cosmic beat today, challenging you to stay on target if you have specific tasks that need finishing. Luckily, you might be able to get away with delaying your obligations for a while. Mercury and Mars are hyping up your key planet Uranus, giving you planetary permission to get a little crazy in your interactions with friends and family. Go ahead, gamble with your heart and embrace the unknown."
pisces,2014-12-05,"Everything seems a bit hectic today as your thoughts anxiously run around in circles. But this isn't just about exploring a few radical ideas; you actually seek out external events now to match your internal intensity. Unfortunately, you may feel let down if you can't find anyone special to share your passion, but don't allow your disappointment to turn into discouragement. Instead, indulge in an activity for the sake of sheer enjoyment and let your spirit soar."
aries,2014-12-06,Your ideas are bubbling up to the surface and are demanding expression today as the chatty Gemini Full Moon casts its bright light in your 3rd House of Communication. It's almost as if your thoughts have a mind of their own and that their intentions are more urgent than anything else. It might seem as if you don't have a lot of choice in the matter now. Find a way to share what you are thinking with the rest of the world if you want to be at peace with yourself.
taurus,2014-12-06,"Although you may not feel like dealing with financial concerns today, it's wise to attend to money matters anyhow with the clever Gemini Full Moon highlighting your 2nd House of Personal Resources. At the very least, make sure your bills are paid before you purchase a luxury item. Keep in mind that not everyone is impressed with things that glitter and sparkle if the sentiments are insincere. The best gifts are the ones that come from the heart and not the wallet."
gemini,2014-12-06,"You're on an emotional edge while the Gemini Full Moon rattles your restless sign, especially if you recently made personal commitments that you're now reconsidering. You can sense the pull of your own desires, but it might be hard to put your inner process into action today. Your vulnerability leaves you slightly uncomfortable, tempting you to run away from a complicated romantic involvement. Nevertheless, your feelings are in a state of flux. Getting out of your head and into your heart puts things into proper perspective."
cancer,2014-12-06,"You are adaptable like a colorful chameleon as you absorb the energy of today's mutable Gemini Full Moon floating in your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery. Your current emotional high tide bounces you around on the waves of change, but others may not notice right away. Instead of holding your dreams inside, reveal a secret to someone close to you. Expressing your feelings might seem scary at first, but can open the door to a tender and meaningful experience."
leo,2014-12-06,"You secretly long for quality one-on-one time with a significant other now instead of getting lost in the noise of a larger group. Although you might like the idea of shifting the spotlight off of you for a while, it's challenging to maintain anonymity when the interactive Gemini Full Moon highlights your 11th House of Social Networking. You may need to rearrange your schedule today so you can have a heart-to-heart conversation with your trusted companion without feeling the need to rationalize your desires. The heart wants what it wants."
virgo,2014-12-06,"You're being pulled in two directions now, making it tough to choose a single course of action. The Gemini Full Moon brightens your 10th House of Career, reinforcing your recent ambiguity about work. Meanwhile, personal activities or projects at home could distract you from professional responsibilities. Postpone major decisions for a few days until you have the time to think through your plans in a more rational manner. Make whatever necessary adjustments you must today, but don't settle for less in the long run."
libra,2014-12-06,"Sudden waves of wanderlust compel you to dream about going somewhere far away as the flighty Gemini Full Moon buzzes your 9th House of Adventure today. However, the Moon is offset by the Sun in your 3rd House of Immediate Environment, giving you good reasons to stay close to home. Don't worry if you can't resolve your current travel dilemma immediately. Daydreaming about an incredible journey from the comfort of your couch may be less stressful now than dragging your suitcase around the world."
scorpio,2014-12-06,"You might think that you picked the easier path, only to discover that the Gemini Full Moon's presence in your 8th House of Deep Sharing has drawn you into a complicated emotional entanglement. Thankfully, you are able to quickly reestablish a healthy perspective; your persuasive communication skills come to your aid today as you extricate yourself as gracefully as possible from any unnecessary drama. Remember, it's your choice; only you can decide where you want to direct your energy now."
sagittarius,2014-12-06,"You Archers are aiming your intentions into the distance as you dream and scheme your way into the future. Naturally, you wish that nothing was standing in your way, but you still may need to stop and consider someone else's point of view now. Today's Gemini Full Moon activates your 7th House of Partners, suggesting the presence of an unseen aspect of a relationship that complicates your current plans. Don't make any big decisions until you share your thoughts with those you love. Although you cherish your independence, the opinions of others matter more than you think."
capricorn,2014-12-06,"You may have so many little chores to do today that you don't know where to begin. The Gemini Full Moon spotlights your 6th House of Daily Routine, spreading your energy thin and making it difficult to follow through on any single task. Luckily, your imagination helps to co-create your future. Don't worry if you're feeling frustrated because of your lack of progress; you will soon regain your focus and continue on your path. In the meantime, keep your dreams alive at all costs."
aquarius,2014-12-06,"Actions usually speak louder than words, but communicating your feelings now is the most direct way to connect with others. Although today's whimsical Gemini Full Moon lights up your 5th House of Love and Creativity, don't get distracted by witty phrases and clever comebacks. Hold onto your vision of what you want to say and keep returning to the essential point so that your message is heard loud and clear. Even if you are tempted to move on to something else, persistence is your secret weapon of success."
pisces,2014-12-06,"Although you might try to maintain your control of the outer world, the thoughtful Gemini Full Moon shines in your 4th House of Security, drawing you into the inner recesses of your private emotional world. However, you may find yourself cast in a social spotlight. Figuring out how to be in both places at once is more complicated than you might think. You prefer to hang out with your loved ones but responsibility calls and you must answer. The sooner you meet your obligations today, the quicker you can return to enjoying the company of your friends and family."
aries,2014-12-07,"It's easier to dream about success than to achieve it today. Your thoughts present an interesting dilemma because they seem so brilliant until you try to turn them into something tangible. Unfortunately, your goals may be so inflated that it's unlikely you will get what you want unless you bring your fantasies back down to size. Adding a bit of common sense into the equation might be enough to prevent you from floating off into the clouds."
taurus,2014-12-07,"Pulling up the drawbridge to protect your castle may sound like a good idea now because you really don't want outsiders to know what you're feeling. However, your defensive tactics could backfire, creating more problems than they solve. Even if you lock out all bothersome intruders, you are still telegraphing a message of detachment to others. Don't do anything that attracts extra attention today; just mind your own business as quietly as you can and the world might very well pass you by."
gemini,2014-12-07,"A current relationship dilemma may seem larger than it really is today, and avoiding the issue won't make it go away. This is tricky territory because turning a molehill into a mountain only wastes time and energy. However, the longer you pretend that everything is fine, the more annoying the situation becomes. Don't wait until it's too late for a simple solution. Bringing your feelings out into the open encourages others to do the same. Honest communication is the first step toward lasting resolution."
cancer,2014-12-07,"You might be struggling to get out of a hole you dug yourself but, thankfully, you have more power and determination than you realize. Instead of wondering why others haven't come to your rescue, make a plan to overcome the current obstacles on your own. You don't need to waste any precious energy blaming anyone, including yourself. Just assess your present condition, roll up your sleeves and get to work. You may be pleasantly surprised with how quickly you can turn things around once you put your mind to it."
leo,2014-12-07,"You grow more contemplative as the day wears on and you might worry about your lack of energy or your current disinterest in social activities. However, this is an unexpected opportunity to recharge your batteries before the next round of roaring begins in a few days. There may be things you want to say, but each time you start to share what's on your mind, the conversation doesn't seem to go in the right direction. Timing is everything so wait for the right moment to speak your piece. Give yourself permission to fly under the radar for a change."
virgo,2014-12-07,"You may experience a strong emotional charge today, but sharing your feelings openly is an entirely different matter. Your unexpressed passions could grow out of hand as you feed your fantasies with the energy of your conscious thoughts. But telling your story doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing proposition. You can edge your way into it without having to turn a single secret into an open book. A small disclosure now might be enough to open the door to a more substantial conversation later on."
libra,2014-12-07,"Your preoccupation with home and family issues could put you in an awkward situation today, especially if others are expecting you to show up with a smile on your face. But you don't necessarily feel all that positive as you contemplate the practical matters that require your attention now. Fortunately, you don't need to sacrifice your inner work for the sake of outer appearances. Do what you do best: find a middle path to carry you safely between the darkness and the light."
scorpio,2014-12-07,"You feel the familiar stirrings of deep emotions bubble up into awareness as the mystical Moon returns to fellow water sign Cancer. But all is not perfect when the strong currents shake up enough debris to cloud your way. Nevertheless, standing up and demonstrating your optimism appears easy for you, even if you have grave concerns about your present circumstances. Fortunately, you don't have to commit to a specific course of action just yet as long as you're willing to let go of your attachment to the five senses and simply trust your intuition."
sagittarius,2014-12-07,"You're approaching the end of the road, but you are confident that another route will soon appear to take you in a different direction. In fact, you have been eagerly anticipating this change and now that it's almost here, it's quite irritating that you're still dealing with the old stuff rather than pushing off into new territory. Practicing patience helps, but it's going to be hard to finish up your current tasks while you're so busy thinking about the future. Nevertheless, doing everything in the proper order today makes it easier to achieve success tomorrow."
capricorn,2014-12-07,"Your uncertain future reflects your lingering fears. Even if you think you know what's best for you and your loved ones, everything seems to be blown out of proportion now and you are having a tough time putting all the pieces back into perspective. You may ask others for their input; however, they are not going to give you the reality factor you need today. Only time and continued soul-searching will answer your questions. Patience, grasshopper; your current worries won't hold you back for long."
aquarius,2014-12-07,"Normally, you're attracted to the unconventional and the unexpected, but traveling unfamiliar highways may be slightly unsettling today. Thankfully, there are no immediate dangers -- just your free-floating anxiety to distract you. You might think your bearings are off and you're not sure which way to turn. Paradoxically, fully accepting your temporary loss of direction reduces the stress so you can find your sense of humor and navigate your way back to familiar ground."
pisces,2014-12-07,"The oddest thing about your current situation is that the more you accomplish, the more you realize how much work there is still left to do. Unfortunately, you can't just walk away from your obligations now. You might even have to put extra effort into what seems like an impossible task. Forget about the final goal since you're not going to arrive there today, anyhow. Meanwhile, keep in mind that everything you do along the way can have a positive and lasting influence on the future."
aries,2014-12-08,"You may have a sinking feeling today as you realize that your actions aren't necessarily supporting your desires. Ironically, you're still tempted to continue on your current path of denial by ignoring your intuition. Remember, your happiness depends on stopping long enough to listen to your heart. Your natural instincts aren't useful if you keep overriding them with rational analysis and empty justifications. Don't leave your intellect in control now; have faith in what the universe is trying to tell you."
taurus,2014-12-08,"You might be stuck behind a wall of worry, holding onto old beliefs that are no longer relevant to your current situation. Nevertheless, you still could create convincing stories to justify your fears today. But self-doubt isn't helpful and only increases your sense of isolation. Rather than clinging to the past, envision the future just as you wish to see it. Focusing on positive affirmations is the most reliable way to improve the odds for your success."
gemini,2014-12-08,"There's no need to stay in constant motion today, even if you enjoy running around. Although you might not accomplish your goals while moving at high speeds, you could be happily surprised with how much you can finish by slowing down just a little. However, you may need to make other changes, too. Instead of trying to demonstrate your cleverness to everyone, listening more attentively will sufficiently impress others."
cancer,2014-12-08,"Finding the right words to accurately describe your feelings isn't always easy. However, the reflective Moon is back in your introspective sign, increasing your emotional sensitivity and making you more aware of your inner process. Unfortunately, being clear about your needs is complicated now since your moods are shifting so quickly. You may be happy one moment and sad the next, so it's crucial to inform others that your disclosures are authentic, even if your thoughts are still in flux."
leo,2014-12-08,"Your confidence soars now that your goals are in sight, but the cosmic forces remind you that everything still takes longer than you expect. You might end up feeling disappointed if you mistakenly believe that you can push the river faster than it's already flowing. However, you should be able to relax today once you remember that all water reaches the sea exactly on time. Be smart and allow current events to follow their own natural course without any unnecessary pressure on your part."
virgo,2014-12-08,"Performing mental gymnastics might be a clever way to maintain your illusion of control today. However, there's nothing to be gained now by struggling with your analysis of a crucial relationship issue. Sticking to the facts isn't helpful because important information may be revealed to you through the symbols in your imagination. Obstacles are easier to overcome once you acknowledge the significance of your dreams even if they don't make sense yet. Not everything that's important can be measured or described."
libra,2014-12-08,"You usually don't like playing the role of a mother hen, but the nurturing Cancer Moon's presence in your 10th House of Responsibility encourages you to stick your nose in everyone else's business. Unfortunately, it's nearly impossible to distinguish between your need to be in control and your well-intentioned desire to support others. Still, everyone benefits from your intervention if you're willing to stop to re-examine your motives prior to offering a helping hand."
scorpio,2014-12-08,"Unexpected events at work might require so much of your undivided attention today that you forget to check in with your feelings. However, your emotions can explode into consciousness if you try to bury them for too long. Thankfully, reconnecting with your center is one of the smartest things you can do with your time. Once you overcome your initial resistance, fear dissipates and your reluctance morphs into the sweet anticipation of what comes next."
sagittarius,2014-12-08,"A surprising emotional encounter isn't usually enough to adversely affect your natural optimism, yet you might forget to count your blessings today. Although you can sidestep the oncoming negativity if you have the sense to move quickly, you may feel like a deer as it fearfully stares into the oncoming headlights. Nevertheless, you are the master of your own destiny and a passionate exchange could put you in touch with an important spiritual truth that carries you out of danger."
capricorn,2014-12-08,"You may grow annoyed with a close friend who seems overly needy today. Unfortunately, you might even misinterpret someone's emotional behavior as an apparent sign of weakness, especially if you don't want your own feelings to stand in the way of your ambitions. Be careful; suppressing your more vulnerable side creates the wrong impression. Ironically, being open about your discomfort with another person's problems can actually lead to cultivating a deeper and more meaningful relationship."
aquarius,2014-12-08,"Don't waste any valuable time brooding over how others perceive you today. Thankfully, you are likely to receive emotional support from your close friends and family, inspiring you to move through your fears pretty quickly now. Shifting your focus away from your inner world and onto external events helps you maintain a positive attitude so you can make the most of the day. Let your freak flag fly; those who know you appreciate the fact that you dance to a different drummer."
pisces,2014-12-08,"An unspoken attraction could suddenly morph into an obsession today, especially if you are trying to ignore strong feelings you have for someone special. But pretending that your desires don't exist is not a healthy strategy because your unexpressed feelings gain power if they remain in the dark. Your secret to happiness is knowing that you can acknowledge what you want without necessarily acting on it now. Sometimes fantasies are best left to the imagination."
aries,2014-12-09,"Patience is a virtue, but it's not an easy one to master for an impulsive Ram. Fortunately, you are more receptive to learning about the benefits of waiting when the reflective Moon is shining in tenacious Cancer. You can enjoy the present moment even more if you don't push too hard. There is no reason to struggle today; a current idea will reach fruition only when it's ready and not when you think it should."
taurus,2014-12-09,"You have a sneaking suspicion that you can't put off hard work for much longer. Your key planet Venus soars in idealistic Sagittarius but lands in realistic Capricorn tomorrow; you intuitively know that you can hang onto your romantic dreams one more day before coming back down to earth. However, you don't have to wait. Heeding your internal voice of reason today empowers you to act preemptively and prevent an unnecessary setback. The sooner you shift gears, the better."
gemini,2014-12-09,"Relationship dynamics are at the forefront of your thoughts today as the gentle Cancer Moon misaligns with romantic Venus in your 7th House of Others. Unfortunately, nothing is gained by automatically placing someone else's needs ahead of yours. Naturally, altruistic acts of love can be emotionally and spiritually transforming, but not if you are avoiding important issues of your own. Taking care of yourself first allows you to give someone special a more meaningful gift later."
cancer,2014-12-09,"Your current behavior is motivated by your desire to make good feelings last longer now that the Moon is highlighting your nurturing sign. But you might feel as if everything is moving too quickly for your taste, prompting you to seek ways to slow down the pace of events. Thankfully, time is on your side. Be patient and observe what's happening in the present moment rather than trying to manipulate events in order to get what you want. Paradoxically, letting go of your expectations may be the most direct route to achieving satisfaction."
leo,2014-12-09,"You may feel as if you're in the eye of a hurricane today; even though storms of change are raging around you, you manage to remain centered and unwavering as you continue on your path. But you might have to make several adjustments to your plans now as you respond to the fluctuating circumstances. Even if you get swept up in the intensity of the moment, your positive attitude enables you to stay on track. Keep calm and let your courage be your guide."
virgo,2014-12-09,"Your social life is the source of complications now, motivating you to pull into your shell until the emotional dynamics settle down. Although your assessment of the situation is probably accurate, it's challenging to maintain a balanced perspective while the moody Cancer Moon is transiting through your 11th House of Friends. You might be overly concerned about not fitting in with the group. Follow your instincts; giving everyone a little breathing room may be all that's needed to clear the air and restore harmony."
libra,2014-12-09,"Sometimes it's not healthy to let your dreams spill over into your waking hours, but now they can be a valuable source of solace and even inspiration. Your ruling planet Venus reminds you of the importance of your hopes today as she spends her last day in visionary Sagittarius. There's no reason to hold back as you explore the possibilities ahead within the privacy of your imagination. However, don't expect all your wishes to come true right away. Seek satisfaction in what's real while also honoring your ideal vision for the future."
scorpio,2014-12-09,"Although you could be treading a fine line between passion and anger now, others might not notice you are on edge. This isn't because of anyone else's insensitivity; it's the result of your skillful ability to hide your feelings. Keeping quiet for another day may be long enough to give you the time needed to untangle your complex desires. It's better to make a rational decision than one based on an impulsive reaction. Trees that grow slowly bear the best fruit."
sagittarius,2014-12-09,"You may have an endless stream of exciting ideas to lead you into the future, but your energy level might not match your dreams. The security-conscious Cancer Moon challenges you to balance your natural wanderlust with your current need for emotional stability. Suddenly, staying home could sound more appealing than running off to some exotic destination. Instead of trying to reconcile your conflicting desires, make enough room in your schedule for both rest and play. Take time to recharge your batteries so you have enough stamina for the adventures ahead."
capricorn,2014-12-09,"Your social and career ambitions are extremely important to you, but sometimes it's healthy to set your goals aside for a while. The introspective Cancer Moon harmonizes with your ruling planet Saturn today, enabling you to relax and enjoy yourself instead of worrying about climbing the ladder of success. Your responsibilities aren't going anywhere, but you'll feel rejuvenated and better equipped to tackle your work after you return from a playful excursion. There's no limit to what you can accomplish when you're at your best."
aquarius,2014-12-09,"Although others may think you're emotionally aloof or just plain weird, you are comfortable with your logical approach to life. Ironically, you might not be able to avoid your feelings today, even if you prefer to present a cool and carefree exterior. Don't resist the strong emotional currents as your changing moods draw you out of your head and into your heart. Showing your vulnerability could actually strengthen your connection with someone you love."
pisces,2014-12-09,"You're fully in touch with your feelings today, even if you're wary of sharing them with anyone else. Maybe you don't want to burden a friend with your emotional process or, perhaps, you're fearful of being rejected if you share your truth. Either way, inaccurate assumptions could stand between you and your happiness. Don't fall victim to your own negativity now. If you muster up enough courage to ask for what you want, you might be pleasantly surprised with the response."
aries,2014-12-10,"You're not in the mood to play by anyone else's rules today, but your rebellious attitude can create problems if you just do the opposite of whatever you are told. Striking out on your own may seem like the best course of action, but your efforts won't lead to a positive outcome now unless you also take time to listen to others. Don't lose sight of your dreams, but remember to soften your stance so you don't needlessly alienate your allies. You gain more support if you're willing to be a team player."
taurus,2014-12-10,"At times you seem stubborn for no obvious reason, yet you may have an excellent justification for maintaining the status quo today. Unfortunately, you might find it challenging to explain your motives to others because you are so confident now that you could sound self-righteous. Although you're not likely to change your mind, demonstrating a bit of flexibility in your thinking can help you to get what you want. Accommodating others doesn't mean you have to surrender your convictions."
gemini,2014-12-10,"Your plans to network with others could run into unexpected glitches today because everyone seems to have his or her own agenda. Fortunately, you can have a positive impact on the flow of events by concentrating on long-term goals now instead of short-term frustrations. Simply shifting your perspective alleviates pressures that might otherwise evoke conflict. Tempering your extreme reactions improves your chances for establishing meaningful connections."
cancer,2014-12-10,"Coworkers might be so passionate about their ideas that you feel like retreating to insulate yourself from the intensity. You don't want to be coerced into making a choice before you're ready, so you're tempted to withdraw without fully revealing your feelings. However, your fears can exacerbate a tricky situation. Instead of seeking solitude now, admit your sensitivity and ask your associates to wait until you make up your mind. You don't have to compromise your core beliefs in order to listen with an open mind."
leo,2014-12-10,"You may enthusiastically respond to someone's social invitation without even checking your calendar now that the reactive Moon is back in your sign. Unfortunately, you might discover that you said yes to one too many offers. If you don't consider what happens next, you could be unhappily surprised that your bravado steered you wrong. On the other hand, you won't have to apologize if you just remember to moderate your natural exuberance with a bit of common sense. Promise less, deliver more."
virgo,2014-12-10,"Burying your head in the sand is not the wisest approach to handling an intense emotional encounter today. You are more transparent than you realize, and others probably won't trust you if they think that you aren't being totally honest. Don't wait until your frustration reaches a boiling point before saying what's on your mind. Avoiding an argument is easy now if you remember to share your feelings calmly before they take on a life of their own."
libra,2014-12-10,"Your need to please others leads to fun today as long as you don't have selfish motives. But your expectations can get in the way of a wonderful experience if you're only considering what's advantageous for you. Ultimately, you may struggle with control issues now, so try letting go of your attachment to any specific outcome. You might just end up experiencing more pleasure than you thought possible if you allow someone else to take charge."
scorpio,2014-12-10,"You might believe that you have to stand strong today, but your worries about being judged harshly could prompt you to overstate your opinion. You may even be so rigid in your presentation that others back off because they think there's not enough room for negotiation. Fortunately, you can soften your message without weakening your conviction. Keep in mind that someone's alternative point of view doesn't necessarily threaten yours. Cultivating collaboration brings out the best in everyone."
sagittarius,2014-12-10,"Your optimism reaches new heights now, and you might not have the patience to listen to anyone's negativity. If someone expresses dissatisfaction with your agenda today, you could be tempted to just run off and do your own thing. Nevertheless, it's not wise to react so quickly if it means excluding others from your plans. Take a few deep breaths and give your cohorts time to come around because it will be much more fun to play in a group."
capricorn,2014-12-10,"It seems as if someone is exerting unnecessary influence over you today and you don't like it one bit. Instead of burying yourself in your work to avoid a confrontation, you could be sufficiently annoyed to face it head-on -- especially if you know that you are right. However, you might inadvertently create a situation where being a winner makes someone else a loser. Rather than taking a competitive stance now, change the framework into a cooperative one where everyone comes out ahead. Adopting an inclusive approach allows your leadership skills to shine."
aquarius,2014-12-10,"You prefer others to be transparent about their needs, but you're not too happy with friends or coworkers who act selfishly today. You may try to maintain your positive attitude, but you might respond with anger if someone pushes you too hard. The decision is completely in your hands; you don't have to encourage conflict. You have the power to deflect aggression by quietly holding your position and waiting things out. Taking the high road is the best way to keep the peace."
pisces,2014-12-10,"You may feel the need to put on a show at work today because you want to be appreciated for your contributions. But instead of making an unnecessary scene, just quietly go about your business since completing your chores and fulfilling your obligations will garner more respect than empty shenanigans. Doing your job well brings you more recognition in the long run. Save your song and dance for when your work is done."
aries,2014-12-11,"You're ready to hit the accelerator and show the world what you can do now, but a more rational voice advises you to be responsible. Although you see new possibilities everywhere, consider the relationships you have already created before running off in search of something else. Even if the grass on the next hill appears greener, remember that unexplored territory often seems more colorful when viewed from a distance. Slowing down for a few weeks is a small price to pay for the potential of finding lasting satisfaction."
taurus,2014-12-11,"It seems as if you are being covered by a warm and cozy security blanket now that your key planet Venus is taking up residence in a fellow earth sign. This gentle transit might not make all your troubles disappear, but it certainly can give you a firm footing on which to improve your finances, career and love life. There's no need to be greedy now; even modest gains in any of these areas can substantially enhance the quality of your life."
gemini,2014-12-11,"Beware of unnecessary detours when it comes to relationships, since you may have a few weeks of complications ahead. You naturally prefer splashing around in the surf, but are now left unsatisfied unless you consciously tread into deeper waters. The problem is that diving into serious emotions can make you uneasy. Even if you're eager to explore your feelings, they might not easily give up the wisdom you seek. Don't wait for a push from reality; get ahead of the curve now, while you can."
cancer,2014-12-11,"You might think romance should be like a walk in the park with charming Venus now strolling through your 7th House of Partnerships. However, it's not sunshine and roses because the Goddess of Love demands more structure while within conservative Capricorn's domain. This cosmic conflict creates a bit of a problem, since you may be offered the emotional security you want, along with too many restrictions. What price are you willing to pay for a relationship? Whether it seems like it or not, the decision is all yours."
leo,2014-12-11,"It's not that the party is completely over yet, but you might catch glimpses of a more serious future. Although all good things must come to an end, you can stretch the fun for a while with your attention to detail and commitment to work. But lighthearted play won't come easily today unless you make time for something more practical. Paradoxically, you may not be fully satisfied now unless you have a particular goal in mind."
virgo,2014-12-11,"It's not always easy to let someone get to close to you, but resourceful Venus now rides to your rescue as she travels through your 5th House of Love and Romance. This won't remove every stop sign you've carefully erected around your heart, but it can help you to be more emotionally expressive. Let your feelings flow, even if some interactions seem too scripted for your own taste. A few sprinkles of spontaneity are sufficient to spice up the stew."
libra,2014-12-11,"You're in for a round of self-criticism as you examine the reality of your feelings, your home and those structures that cannot easily be changed. Your emotions become subservient to the everyday responsibilities of your life. Fortunately, you can still be creative and have your share of fun. Nevertheless, you must make your life work within the restrictions that are currently being imposed. Paradoxically, accepting that which cannot be changed bring a new sense of freedom."
scorpio,2014-12-11,"Your professional trajectory may not be progressing as you wish. Fortunately, you're quite willing to jump in and deal with the issues. One thing is for sure: denial will not get you anywhere now. Situations that have appeared impossible in the past begin to transform and evolve right in front of your eyes. Communication is the key to your success. Start slowly and proceed with unwavering determination if you want to move mountains."
sagittarius,2014-12-11,"You may be somewhat unsure of your emotions today, even if you thought you knew how you felt yesterday. You normally lead with your heart, inspiring yourself and others with your passion. But, perhaps you now begin to realize that you created a relationship situation that seems to be growing too restrictive. Take responsibility for your feelings before making any moves you might regret."
capricorn,2014-12-11,"In your heart of hearts, you might not believe that money and love should come without a cost. You're accustomed to working hard for what you receive and, luckily, your efforts will be rewarded. As sweet Venus moves through your sign for the next few weeks, you notice that it's easier to get along with others. In fact, it's even easier to get along with yourself. Your newly found optimism is the main theme of the month ahead. Spread joy wherever you go and enjoy others as they enjoy you."
aquarius,2014-12-11,"You're more attracted to fantasy than to reality now that Venus is hiding out in your 12th House of Escapism. Nevertheless, your desires are quite real so put up whatever walls are necessary to function in your mundane world. Ultimately, your current tendency is to lock up your needs within the recesses of your subconscious while playing caretaker to someone you love. But avoid falling into the role of martyr. Push your heart into the open and build a stable foundation for your future."
pisces,2014-12-11,"Even your most meaningful encounters now take on an air of casual friendship. Passions are subdued with Venus the Goddess of Love visiting emotionally conservative Capricorn. In fact, this is a wonderful time to schedule a variety of social engagements, but the current planetary signs don't singularly emphasize romance. Whether you are a solo act or part of a duo, make time to enjoy the company of others while the cosmic energy is on your side."
aries,2014-12-12,"You can see large patterns in complex systems, enabling you to wow everyone with your original thinking. You may be inspired when you arrive at a brilliant solution to a problem at work today, but even the best ideas won't have lasting impact unless you bring them down to earth. Nevertheless, micromanaging your progress only slows you down. Practicing a bit of emotional detachment frees you to accomplish more than you ever dreamed possible. You might be pleasantly surprised by what you can get done when you don't worry so much about the results."
taurus,2014-12-12,"You will have time to enjoy yourself today if you make sure that you keep your goals relatively simple. No matter how straightforward your tasks seem, completing them requires more effort than you think. Instead of leaving an unpleasant task for another day, pace yourself so you don't burn out before the job is finished. Get the hardest chores out of the way first so your day grows easier as it unfolds. Taking pride in your work raises the day's vibrations to a joyful level."
gemini,2014-12-12,"It's not easy for anyone to pin you down today. You aren't likely to share too many details of your inner process because you could be fearful that someone will expect more than you can deliver now. However, your worries are probably unfounded. Rather, it's your tendency to avoid making commitments that motivates your friends to want more information. Nevertheless, it isn't wise to hide your feelings; you're better off saying what's on your mind, even if it's not what others want to hear. The truth will set you free."
cancer,2014-12-12,"You have so much on your plate today that you may jump through hoops to confirm your schedule with others to prevent anything from going wrong. Unfortunately, your advanced planning could end up having the opposite effect. Your attention to detail can't compensate for overbooking your day. A lack of flexibility becomes an open invitation for a missed appointment. Leave enough time between commitments so your calendar won't topple like a fragile house of cards."
leo,2014-12-12,"You may be tempted to start a new project today, but it's more productive to build on work you already have in progress. Even if you're bored with what you're doing now, don't fall into the trap of believing that you can have more fun if you were only participating in an entirely different game. Changing your current strategy won't necessarily make you any happier; when it comes down to it, you only have to change your attitude. A positive approach makes you a better team player when it counts the most."
virgo,2014-12-12,"It's natural to focus on each individual component of a job today, but you might become so involved with what you're doing that you lose track of your overall goals. Balancing your narrow concentration with global thinking may be a familiar trouble spot, but now you're aware of the problems that can arise when going to either extreme. Keeping both perspectives in your current awareness allows you to accomplish more than you expect."
libra,2014-12-12,"You might not want to continue on your current path because you're searching for a new adventure. Making changes within the confines of your fantasies is easy, but it's much more difficult to do it in the real world. Dreaming about your ideal future helps you feel better in the present moment, but you have to return to reality sooner or later. Thankfully, a small modification to your daily routine may be all that's needed to alter your direction."
scorpio,2014-12-12,"Your friends might believe they are supporting you, but you may not be happy with the way they show it today. You prefer one-hundred-percent honesty, yet you really don't like anyone telling you what to do. If you already have a plan in place, you want others to offer friendly advice now rather than criticize you. Nevertheless, you may be wiser to accept that they mean well and be thankful for their concern. Count yourself lucky to have people in your corner who really care."
sagittarius,2014-12-12,"You can talk circles around others today but your silver tongue doesn't make executing your plan any less complicated. Although you might believe you know the best route to your destination, you can't tell whether or not you're making progress unless you set measurable milestones along the way. Don't wait until the end to see if you're successful. Instead, break your project down into small manageable tasks and step through them one at a time. Yard by yard it's hard; inch by inch it's a cinch."
capricorn,2014-12-12,"It's crucial to balance your personal ambitions with what's already on your calendar for today. However, you might have to cooperate with others, even if they don't possess the same level of clarity that you do. Although you intuitively know what's right, it's challenging to explain your choices to anyone else. Don't waste your energy trying to justify your behavior now; just go ahead and do whatever is necessary. You can always share your logic after the fact if you are so inclined."
aquarius,2014-12-12,"You feel driven to convince others to work on a pet project with you today. Even if you don't have to involve anyone else in your decision-making process, you can still gain great benefit from enlisting the approval of your friends or colleagues. Keep your expectations to a minimum or you'll feel discouraged if your goals aren't fully supported by your peers. Share your plans and then listen carefully to the feedback you receive before heading off on your own."
pisces,2014-12-12,"Choosing how much effort to put toward garnering support for your long-term goals is a delicate matter today. You can sound desperate if you're overly insistent, making others less eager to help you. However, it could be just as problematic if you're so cocky that you appear totally self-sufficient. Remember, your positive outlook works in your favor now if you're clear about your intentions right from the start."
aries,2014-12-13,"You might give the impression that you're invincible today and nothing will prevent you from fulfilling your promises. Nevertheless, there is an inkling of insecurity arising from the dark recesses of your subconscious. You can behave with all the bravado you want, but your actions won't hide your growing suspicion that you don't have it all together. Acknowledge the warnings of your inner voice, but don't waste time doubting your abilities. Seeing things exactly as they are offers you the best chance for success."
taurus,2014-12-13,"You are receiving plenty of encouragement from your friends, family and fans today. This unsolicited support is largely due to how well your emotions are currently integrated with your actions, allowing others to know the true you. Nevertheless, you may still be uncertain about recent choices you made that impact those closest to you. Even if you don't have all the answers now, just be sincere about your intentions and you can't go wrong."
gemini,2014-12-13,"The intensity may be slowly settling down, but it doesn't seem fast enough to you. There are still powerful emotions floating around in the atmosphere and it makes you slightly uncomfortable. But at least you have somewhere to go with your feelings and you no longer feel as trapped as you did. However, don't plan your escape too quickly because there are still lessons to learn from the situation as the energy plays on through to its conclusion."
cancer,2014-12-13,"Whether you are counting the coins in your piggy bank, balancing your checking account or submitting a purchase offer on a million dollar property, it all comes back to basics. If you have unfinished financial business, now would be a propitious time to tie up loose ends. The question is how much effort should you put into the details? Unfortunately, no one has the answer but you; become your own conscientious taskmaster and your efforts will pay off."
leo,2014-12-13,"Spiritual mysteries may seem more fascinating now as you receive indecipherable signals from the hidden realms. Perhaps your intuition is working overtime and your sixth sense is picking up some new information that will probably get you into trouble if you act on it. Even if you decide to follow your instincts, keeping others informed about your choices enables everyone to be on the same page."
virgo,2014-12-13,"Sometimes it's logical to set rationality aside and trust in your feelings. Oddly enough, irrationality has its own special place in your orderly world, too. Let the cascade of emotions and images flow from your subconscious mind into awareness without your normal filters, pushing past the limitations that have been holding you back for too long. Facts are important, but now it's time to temporarily put them on the back burner. Open your heart and let the magic begin."
libra,2014-12-13,"Once again, you find yourself playing the role of a diplomat as you attempt to ameliorate the building tension. No matter how persuasive you may be today, there are still things that you just cannot make go away with a positive attitude and a charming smile. Fortunately, your optimism isn't wasted since your well-intended actions can help patch up a difficult situation when others might have walked away. Do what you do best and create common ground."
scorpio,2014-12-13,"All the bright colors of the rainbow mysteriously blend together to become invisible. Ironically, this is science at work; however, it may feel like magic as the mixture of positive and negative forces now combine into an even more powerful energy. Fear and shame alchemically transform into love and compassion, enabling you to move your life in the direction that is best for all involved."
sagittarius,2014-12-13,"There is no stopping you now if your motives are clear, so make certain that you are heading in the right direction before you're too far down the path. It's not that you are so off-track in your thinking these days. It's just that there is an irritating voice in the back of your head yelling out warnings, telling you to proceed with caution. Listen to your intuition and then follow your heart."
capricorn,2014-12-13,"Your cool and collected rational brain is working at its peak and optimistically influences your thoughts. Usually, you tend toward conserving energy for when you might need it in the future. However, your intuition tells you that everything can work out for the best if you move forward with your agenda. Remember, you must practically apply your positive feelings for them to have any lasting effect."
aquarius,2014-12-13,"Those closest to you are reflecting your most powerful dreams right back at you now. It's as if they already know what is best for you, and are encouraging you to act accordingly. Listen to the advice you are receiving, but also stay aware that everything looks a little better than it is in reality. However, just because you're wearing rose-colored glasses doesn't mean that you should let the current opportunities slip away. While you're deciding what to do, make sure that everyone knows how much you appreciate their support."
pisces,2014-12-13,"It is uncharacteristic of you to make a big deal about your work, but something inside you is itching to get the recognition that you deserve. In your opinion, everyone wastes too much energy on activities just to get noticed. Meanwhile, you prefer playing the invisible martyr, performing your job without too much fuss and fanfare. Nevertheless, letting the spotlight fall on you now won't hurt. In fact, the opposite is true; the attention just might do you a world of good."
aries,2014-12-14,"You can have an amazing day as long as you remember to take your common sense along with you while dancing in the clouds. If you cannot contain your enthusiasm, you run the risk of flying too high -- and then there could be a heavy price to pay. It's not worth feeling good for a short amount of time, only to realize that you've gone a step too far. Tread lightly to keep your illusions from crashing to the ground."
taurus,2014-12-14,"You have an uncanny ability to recover your energy and reestablish your balance, even if you are feeling a bit off today. In fact, your optimistic outlook inspires you to make the most of pretty much everything that comes your way now. You can visualize potential everywhere you look, and with a bit of effort, you're able to accomplish nearly anything you set out to do. Challenges are just opportunities waiting to happen."
gemini,2014-12-14,"You are totally jazzed about all the possibilities ahead of you today. But even though you love the variety of your options, you still need to make some hard choices. Fortunately, if you're willing to commit to one path, you can set a very powerful cycle into motion. Think about what you need to do to push your plan forward and make your mark. For now, reality is the stuff of dreams."
cancer,2014-12-14,"You are shown a silver lining to a dark cloud that has been following you around. However, this revelation isn't about ignoring the real issues or discovering a quick fix. You can see the best possible outcome in your mind's eye, as if you are coloring in all the missing details. The extraordinary part of this dynamic is that you can magically weave your dreams into the fabric of your life. There's no reason to wait for a better opportunity when the best one is already right in front of your nose."
leo,2014-12-14,"You feel like a lucky Lion today because you're moving in harmony with an inherently prosperous universe and rewards just seem to manifest. But wonderful things aren't happening to you; you are co-creating positive energy in cahoots with bountiful Jupiter's alignment with the Sun in your 5th House of Self-Expression. All you need to do is let your confidence lead the way, but don't let it turn to arrogance. Fortunately, you can set the stage now for success to blossom if you're intent on following your dreams and willing to keep your ego in check."
virgo,2014-12-14,"You might not have to go anywhere today to receive a positive sign from the cosmos. Good news finds you even if you are hiding out at home. You might misjudge the significance of a social event, especially if you feel as if you are being coerced to attend. Remember, showing up willingly for a loved one can ultimately create sweet memories that last for years to come."
libra,2014-12-14,"You can make substantial gains today as you appear more optimistic than you actually feel. However, your current progress is about neither fame nor fortune. It's more about the quality of your personal interactions. Remember, good feelings that come from close friendships are, in themselves, great spiritual blessings which are now yours for the asking. There's no need to edit your story to make it sound more enticing; you're perfect just as you are."
scorpio,2014-12-14,"Increasing the stability in any part of your life is advantageous now, for even during these times of big change it's nice to know that you can hold it together. You might even be able to amplify this planetary gift today by turning a current challenge into even greater fiscal security. Whether you have been consciously waiting for the right moment to make your move or simply procrastinating, the time is now. Take a deep breath and a giant leap of faith."
sagittarius,2014-12-14,"Obstacles that have plagued your progress may magically disappear now, leaving you wide-eyed and bushy-tailed as you try to envision the open road ahead. The Sun in your sign is resonating with generous Jupiter, who is now ready to deliver his auspicious goods at your front door. All you need to do is ask, but be careful about making your wish list too long. Requesting more than you need is a trap. Don't be greedy; over-indulgences will not be looked upon favorably by the Karma Police."
capricorn,2014-12-14,"Nearly everyone seems to be impressed with your apparent spontaneity and abandon, but you have probably rehearsed your current actions in the safety of your mind more than once. You look as if you are dancing on the edge now, but in reality you are quite secure in your position. Nevertheless, have fun while the spotlight is shining on you and your competence is being applauded by an admiring audience."
aquarius,2014-12-14,"For some unknown reason, people seem to enjoy indulging you today and you're eager to let them. Perhaps your good luck is the result of your past behavior, but there's no need to analyze things on a deeper level now. The support of friends and family can make an important difference by bolstering your confidence and opening doors to unexpected opportunities. Embrace the love; make the most of your social life while it is in full bloom."
pisces,2014-12-14,"The high-intensity planetary charge won't go away today, even if your nervous energy diminishes as the day unfolds. You're in a creative groove and exude effortless charm now that the Sun and graceful Venus align with visionary Neptune in your sign. Thankfully, you can immerse yourself in everything you do without suffering from emotional burnout. Even if your love life cools down a bit, your career may be very hot. One way or another, something wonderful is knocking at your door, so hurry up and let it in."
aries,2014-12-15,"You may be quick to disagree with someone today because you secretly hope to stir up a lively debate, even if you don't want to create lasting conflict. Nevertheless, you could attack the wrong person if you don't watch what you say. Being aware of the intensity of your reactions now can help to minimize drama and alleviate the volatile tension before it erupts. Channel your anger into creating positive change."
taurus,2014-12-15,"Although you prefer taking a down-to-earth approach to conflict at work, it feels as if you're heading out into a sea of complexity now. Powerful emotions rise to the surface today if someone confronts you about your recent behavior. Attempting to defend yourself by justifying your actions could be a waste of time and energy, whether or not the accusation is true. An apology is in order if you are guilty, but just let it go if you're not. Anything you can do to keep the energy calm is helpful. Think long-term solutions rather than quick fixes for the best results."
gemini,2014-12-15,"Even if you wake up on the wrong side of the bed today, life grows brighter and brighter as the day wears on. You may need to deal with an obstacle that has been placed in your path by your boss or some other authority figure. However, you don't have to confront the problem head-on today when you can simply acknowledge it by dancing around its edges. Although everything seems so urgent, even the most intense feelings will require time to transform into actions. But denial is not a viable option; accepting the challenge to change is the first step to improving your life."
cancer,2014-12-15,"Today you could find yourself in the midst of a fierce emotional confrontation that pulls you into deeper waters. However, you inadvertently make matters worse if you try to avoid any unresolved issues. Listen to your intuition, for the shadows won't hide the truth from you now. You might even discover a treasure in the most unlikely places if you have the courage to stick with the process when it gets messy."
leo,2014-12-15,"You might sense that an unavoidable power struggle is brewing. Intense interactions with a family member or close friend may even open the floodgates of unexpressed emotions today. You could agitate things even further now by revealing a surprise of your own. However, it's wise to think before you speak or you will only complicate the situation even more. Demonstrate your strength of character by smiling and leaving all the drama behind."
virgo,2014-12-15,"You may obsessively seek a simplistic fix to a complex problem today, spinning your all-too-analytical mind into overdrive. Your frustration stems from not being able to separate one situation from another; everything seems to be interrelated now. It's pointless to keep going over the same details again and again. Things will begin to make more sense when you accept that logic won't bring you the solutions you're hoping to find. In the meantime, fire up your right brain and practice a little creative problem solving instead."
libra,2014-12-15,"You might wish that the current relationship stress would quietly dissipate on its own now, but it won't vanish until you face the issues that are bothering you. You may have to stand up to someone's emotional intensity; fortunately, you can hold your ground today as long as your actions are consistent with your feelings. Push through your anxiety and self-judgments as quickly as possible. You have the power to reestablish harmony if you simply just show up and be true to yourself."
scorpio,2014-12-15,"Your psychic radar is picking up a subterranean current of feelings running deeper than any you have recently experienced. On one hand, this is quite a thrill, since you're fascinated by the mystery and believe that you're getting close to discovering something very significant. On the other hand, you are fearful of losing yourself in this powerful energy. Nevertheless, it's safe to let go once you know where you stand in your heart."
sagittarius,2014-12-15,"Your adrenaline drives you to take care of unfinished business early in the day, but your expectations may be unrealistically high now. Although you wish that you could cross everything off your list, at some point you must accept that you need to leave some tasks incomplete. Ironically, once you relinquish control you might even find enough time to relax for a bit. Skillfully managing the flow between work and play today helps pave the most reliable road to success."
capricorn,2014-12-15,"You don't like it one bit if someone pressures you to participate in a group activity when you prefer to be alone. But don't turn your current penchant for privacy into a an emotional showdown or you might just end up exhausting yourself in the process. Save your energy for a more important fight; instead, change your attitude and resign yourself to fulfilling your social obligations without a fuss. Your willingness to be a team player could turn time with others into a treat rather than a chore."
aquarius,2014-12-15,"You find yourself at odds with nearly anyone who is wielding authority today, even if he or she has done little to rattle your cage. Someone might attempt to manipulate you, but you could provoke an entirely different set of problems if you fight back. Unfortunately, it's hard to avoid a conflict once a debate is in progress. Stand up for yourself, but keep the focus on the main points so things don't go awry. Listen as much as you speak to maintain the peace."
pisces,2014-12-15,"You might not feel confident about finishing your chores now because it's challenging to keep your thoughts focused on repetitive tasks. However, you could still be very productive if you stretch your mind beyond the present moment. Give yourself permission to dream while you work; visualizing the future creates a more meaningful path for you to follow. Plant seeds in your fertile imagination today and harvest the fruits of your labor tomorrow."
aries,2014-12-16,"You may be living under the illusion that you can finish all your work or, at least, make solid progress toward your current goals. However, you might end up spinning your wheels in order to spend time with someone who tugs on your heartstrings. Unfortunately, your relationship expectations could be unrealistic now that vulnerable Venus connects with buoyant Jupiter in your 5th House of Love. Forget about chasing the impossible dream because you have a better chance of finding happiness today by pursuing a more responsible path."
taurus,2014-12-16,"You're ready to head off on a wild adventure, but your common sense is telling you to exercise caution as your key planet Venus plods through conservative Capricorn. If you're still involved in serious negotiations, don't rush your response because you could view the current situation in an overly flattering light. Allow a few days to see where your feelings go before saying yes to a proposition that's not really what you want. In the meantime, take a more practical approach by balancing your current desires with what you have to offer in return."
gemini,2014-12-16,"Relationship issues have taken a turn toward the melodramatic now. You're finally willing to let your demands slide today, but the power of your intensity still shines through. You're more likely to be interested in hearing about what others want, especially if you've already taken a risk and put your needs out in the open. Thankfully, the odds are tilted in your favor, so don't give in too quickly. Exploring what you have in common with your partner is healthy as long as you don't compromise your values in the process."
cancer,2014-12-16,"You can't wait to share your radical new ideas about your future, but they may be so outrageous that you're likely to feel let down later when you return to earth. Scale back your expectations before you discover your limitations the hard way. Remain open to taking an entirely different path, but don't try to force change yet. Exercising flexibility can save you from having to face unnecessary discouragement in the days ahead. No hurry, no worry; your secret strength is your natural ability to go with the flow."
leo,2014-12-16,"Your vulnerability might make you uncomfortable with a current situation at work today. Nevertheless, find a way to express what's in your heart without turning anyone into a scapegoat. In fact, you set up barriers to your happiness as soon as you slip into any kind of blame. Discuss your concerns with a trusted friend when you get a chance, but take full responsibility for your emotions. Ironically, nothing has to change; you will feel better about the whole situation once you know that you have been seen and heard."
virgo,2014-12-16,"All of a sudden, romance seems more of a priority now that affectionate Venus is traveling through your 5th House of Love and Play. Juggling current obligations with your desire for fun could muddy the waters between you and a friend. Although your actions speak loudly, your words also pack a powerful punch. Explaining your intentions as clearly as you can opens the door to more meaningful interactions. Find the sweet spot between being practical and following your heart."
libra,2014-12-16,"It may be smarter to hold onto your current job for a while longer even if you've been considering ways to break out of the status quo. Unfortunately, your positive outlook alone isn't sufficient to resolve all the underlying problems. This is no time for complacency because making minor adjustments to your daily routine now could create much more impact than you realize. Don't worry; big changes are still on the horizon. In the meantime, take care of your immediate responsibilities while keeping a hopeful eye on the future."
scorpio,2014-12-16,"Sometimes you are so disappointed by other people's responses to your heartfelt disclosures that you decide to withhold your true feelings so you don't upset those you love. However, you can confidently share your feelings without self-restraint today because diplomatic Venus' presence in your 3th House of Communication softens the hard edges of your message. Thankfully, expressing your truth with kindness now could get you exactly what you want."
sagittarius,2014-12-16,"An ongoing disagreement about your core beliefs may be temporarily set aside today as a fair compromise is on the negotiating table. However, the underlying tension is still present and must be handled eventually. Putting your differences of opinion on hold now doesn't mean your conversations have to be superficial. Establishing sufficient common ground allows you to make steady progress on other issues of concern that can also be resolved at this time. As Einstein wrote, ""ninety-nine percent of genius is knowing what's important."""
capricorn,2014-12-16,"You want to take care of everyone's needs at work now that the nurturing Moon is camping out in your 10th House of Career. You might find yourself in over your head, even if your intentions are honorable. Fortunately, others appreciate your efforts and won't judge you unfairly if you fall short of your goals. Set healthy priorities so you don't spread yourself too thin today. Thankfully, the ripple effect works in your favor; you never know how much good one simple deed can manifest."
aquarius,2014-12-16,"It's no simple task to keep other people's problems separate from your own because you're hypersensitive to everyone's feelings today. You may believe that you have enough ingenuity to fix all the world's problems now, only to realize that your resources are limited in scope. Instead of trying to be a superhero, just offer your emotional support and a shoulder to lean on. Speak from your heart; the right words have the power to heal in ways you can't imagine."
pisces,2014-12-16,"There's an irresistible sparkle in your eyes and a bounce in your step that make it a pleasure to be in your company today. Luckily, you can parlay your cosmic good fortune into something even better if you're willing to close up shop to build a new one. But instead of just telling others what you want, go out of your way to bring happiness to those you love. Your generosity will be paid back to you many times over if your heart is in the right place."
aries,2014-12-17,"Keeping your feet on the ground isn't an easy matter today, for you're tempted to set aside the basic facts to chase an unreachable fantasy. Although ignoring the truth may seem like a clever idea, you can't escape your obligations by just slipping off into another dimension. Fortunately, you can still make good use of your imagination without having to fool anyone if you have the courage to take responsibility for your actions. Walk your talk and you will come out on top."
taurus,2014-12-17,"You are pulled in opposite directions today because you truly want to take care of serious issues as they arise. Paradoxically, you simultaneously wish you could put them off for a while longer. Your innate no-nonsense approach prompts you to deal with unfinished business right away, but you may be at the mercy of your ruling planet Venus as she entices you with more pleasurable pursuits. Keeping up appearances at work provides you with enough cover to get away with a bit of mischief without rocking the boat."
gemini,2014-12-17,"Life seems a little less intense today and you may relax your concerns about how to make everything work. You feel a lighter energy blowing in like a tropical breeze, inspiring you to see the upside of almost any situation. Although your positive attitude usually works in your favor, you might overstep your limits now by ignoring your feelings just because they're inconvenient. Focus on the truth instead of the easy way out. The right mix of positivity and practicality is the secret to your success."
cancer,2014-12-17,"Your intuition is operating at a high level of efficiency now that the reflective Moon is traveling through perceptive Scorpio. However, you still might attempt to bury your feelings if you see the possibility of pursuing pleasure, rather than truth. Having solid data on which to build your plans is ideal, but objectivity is elusive today as your daydreams leak into the real world. Remember, facts can only take you so far while your imagination carries you wherever you want to go."
leo,2014-12-17,"You're suddenly intrigued by the hidden mysteries of the cosmos and you want to know what's going on beneath the surface. However, this metaphysical fascination is at odds with a more primal desire that arises from the pleasure center of your brain. Although detaching from your feelings sounds like a workable strategy, dreams of real intimacy lure you back into your heart. More isn't always better; you can enjoy a rainbow for its inherent beauty without having to dig for a pot of gold, too."
virgo,2014-12-17,"Opportunities abound to cultivate new friendships or even become romantically attracted to someone you meet through your job. However, others might become more emotional than you prefer, motivating you to withdraw into your shell. But the only way to develop enduring relationships built on strong foundations is to stick around even when you feel uncomfortable. Surprisingly, letting go of your resistance to emotional expression can also be the key to unleashing your creativity."
libra,2014-12-17,"A shift of cosmic energy drives you to seek extra emotional intensity in all interactions now. You might even want to re-energize a current relationship or create sparks in a new one. However, you're not sure if shiny lights and romantic fantasies are distracting you from the real work at hand. The good news is you don't have to choose; walking in both worlds today enables you to enjoy the fun and games while also making connections on a deeper and more meaningful level."
scorpio,2014-12-17,"You may have your heart set on an impossible partnership, yet compassion is overtaking passion now as your top priority. The Moon's shift into your sign reminds you to establish new relationship priorities and her trine to spiritual Neptune raises the bar of excellence. Unfortunately, finding satisfaction in the real world is challenging when your dreams are so idealistic. Ironically, reconnecting with your inner self strengthens your bonds with others. Just remember, happiness is more likely to be found if you don't expect perfection from anyone, including yourself."
sagittarius,2014-12-17,"You're a proponent of professional camaraderie, but are not so interested in pursuing anything beyond a bit of entertaining conversation today if it interferes with accomplishing your goals. However, don't be too self-critical if you can't seem to make much headway on your work. Give yourself permission to kick off your shoes and dance. Luckily, you'll have a chance later in the week to make up for any lack of productivity now."
capricorn,2014-12-17,"You might be so deeply entrenched in the status quo that you struggle with an ongoing shift of power in your business world. Even if you think that stirring up the energy at work is necessary now, the uncertainty in the air still makes you nervous. Remove the pressure by taking a few more days to decide your next move. However, you can't stop the wheels of progress for long. Once you make up your mind, you can assume an important leadership role in the transformation. But in the meantime, fly beneath the radar for the best results."
aquarius,2014-12-17,"It seems as if you are being granted an unexpected reprieve today because you suddenly have more time to reach your goals. Thankfully, you're quite optimistic about your chances for success, so you can play it cool without worrying about making too many changes. Although there's no need to panic or finish everything right away, there is also no reason to restrain your creativity. Now that assertive Mars is back in your sign, just follow your instincts and let your convictions work their magic. Nature will take its course and pull you along for the ride."
pisces,2014-12-17,"Indulging in your favorite daydreams is addictive, so it's essential to balance your fantasies with reality. However, the Moon's sweet trine to imaginative Neptune in your sign makes it tricky to find the dividing line between fact and fiction now. Instead of struggling to gain clarity today, relax and go with the flow. There is much wisdom to be discovered from your current exploration of the metaphysical realms. Trust the process; you'll be back in the real world before you know it."
aries,2014-12-18,"The distinction between friendship and courtship might be a subtle one now, but it's crucial to be conscious of the difference. Even if you're not seeking more from a relationship, you still can benefit greatly from being aware of your emotions whether expressed or not. However, you don't need to do anything special in order to attain love. Your current lesson is learned by fully experiencing the desires of your heart without attempting to make anyone else responsible for your happiness."
taurus,2014-12-18,"You could withdraw from an interaction with a friend today because the energy has grown too intense and you believe that it isn't leading in a direction that serves your best interests. However, your urgent need to establish firm boundaries doesn't necessarily mean the relationship isn't a healthy one; it simply clarifies a limitation that is wise to acknowledge. Recognizing the truth frees you from confusion of unexpressed assumptions. Navigating carefully around emotional landmines now might be enough to put things back on track."
gemini,2014-12-18,"You may have a detailed picture of exactly what you want to do today, yet nagging self-doubt stands in your way of explaining your plans to anyone else. You might worry that your words won't clearly express what's in your mind. Instead of taking an extemporaneous approach and making it up as you go, think about your message before opening your mouth. But don't be so rigid that there's no give and take. Once you share your initial thoughts, let the conversation flow back and forth organically, without worrying about where it leads."
cancer,2014-12-18,"You might be afraid that you recently overstepped someone's boundaries and wonder if you should apologize and retreat. However, you could feel even more insecure once you express your regret. Fortunately, you probably weren't as far out of line as you think, so it may not be necessary to say anything about it at all. Still, displaying your vulnerability reveals a hidden part of you and is a constructive way to increase the emotional bond with a significant person in your life. The choice is yours; but you'll never know the truth unless you take a risk and speak your piece."
leo,2014-12-18,"Suppressing your annoyance is challenging if a friend misunderstands you today. Your frustration might already be obvious because of a recent disagreement between the two of you; however, the apparent gulf probably seems wider than it is in reality. Recalling another time when you resolved a problem by sharing your feelings can guide you through the current situation. Make the first move and express what's on your mind now. Opening communication channels not only helps others understand your point of view but also could bring you closer in the process."
virgo,2014-12-18,"You don't necessarily believe you deserve any extra recognition for your efforts at work, but ironically, you might feel hurt today if you aren't acknowledged by your peers. You know you have been doing more than your fair share, so it's not too much of a stretch to dream about receiving a raise or, at least, a pat on the back. However, it's not productive to dwell on your fantasies now, so quickly process any disappointment you experience and get back to the tasks at hand. True validation of a job well done comes from within."
libra,2014-12-18,"You rationally know all the reasons why you can't have everything you want now, but intellectual awareness doesn't diminish your desires. However, it's helpful to realize that some of the restraints may be self-imposed and arise from your fear of being vulnerable when you're being so honest. Go ahead and share your feelings but don't push your luck too far. The simple act of initiating a conversation can open the door to emotional fulfillment as long as your expectations aren't set in stone."
scorpio,2014-12-18,"You are sometimes attracted to the shady side of Love Street where the Sun doesn't shine. You understand that sweet delights and emotional goodies are possible once you work your way through the darker feelings that hide in the shadows. However, you may be stuck today, unable to push through old negative patterns. There's no need to be overly concerned, but don't slip into denial either. Learn from every experience; the clouds will clear soon enough, leaving you wiser and happier than before your journey began."
sagittarius,2014-12-18,"You might try to gloss over a persistent relationship dilemma with clever conversation and witty jokes. You may subscribe to the belief that focusing on a problem could actually make it worse. However, avoiding your feelings is more damaging to a lasting partnership now than directly facing the truth -- even if it makes you nervous. Demonstrate your courage by willingly digging into the most intense issues. The formula is simple: if you do your emotional processing today, you should feel like your old self tomorrow."
capricorn,2014-12-18,"You can feel the electrical tension in the air now, making your hair stand on end. It's as if you know an emotional storm is brewing on the horizon, even if the current dynamics seem serenely calm. The fact of the matter is it's going to take time for life to return to normal. The good news is that you sense the anticipation of positive changes around the next bend. But don't wait to see what happens next; instead, create a concrete plan for exactly what you envision for your future and then get busy making it happen."
aquarius,2014-12-18,"The surreal quality of your life could be disconcerting because you don't understand where the strange energy is coming from. However, it may not be the best use of your time to deconstruct the principles at work. Instead, work hard to manifest your fantasies without trying to explain the deeper meaning of everything. Focus on the mundane rather than the metaphysical. Start by asking for exactly what you want. But remember, it's just as important to be in a receptive frame of mind when the future arrives as you want it."
pisces,2014-12-18,"Your high ideals motivate you and others to do amazing things today. Your strength of conviction originates from your unwavering compassion, yet it's your ability to maintain objectivity now that makes you so effective. Detaching from an emotional situation doesn't mean you care any less; in fact, it gives you the impetus to separate your personal desires from the needs of a larger group. But don't expect miracles to happen overnight; a small amount of progress goes a long way toward reaching your altruistic goals."
aries,2014-12-19,"You could inadvertently become emotionally hooked by someone else's agenda today. However, participating in an unnecessary melodrama makes it tough to get your own work done. Thankfully, it shouldn't take long to acknowledge that things cannot continue along the same path. You are sensible enough now to change your attitude which can put control of the day back in your hands. Prioritize what you want to accomplish and then reach for your goals with confidence. Combining integrity with persistence is an unbeatable strategy."
taurus,2014-12-19,"Nothing is gained by escalating a disagreement because conflict won't likely lead to a positive resolution today. Nevertheless, there are no valid reasons to be afraid of standing up for your convictions, but only when it feels right. Even if you have already formed your opinions, it's still wise to maintain a low-key profile for a while longer. You can say what's on your mind later without running as much risk of encountering opposition. Timing is everything when it comes to keeping the peace."
gemini,2014-12-19,"You might feel as if you're being ignored today, but making a scene to attract attention is a waste of precious energy. Just let events unfold naturally because your efforts will be taken more seriously later in the afternoon when the Moon conjuncts authoritative Saturn. You may not have to do anything special to get noticed if you simply stay flexible in your approach to work. Maintain a positive attitude and your interactions with friends and coworkers should continue to improve throughout the day."
cancer,2014-12-19,"You may attempt to sidestep a challenging issue today, especially if you and a loved one have conflicting opinions on the subject. But even if you think you can successfully hide your feelings, you won't be able to avoid reality all day long. Nevertheless, it's best to give your emotions time to settle before jumping into a conversation that you might regret. Taking a rational approach enables you to communicate your position in an effective and compassionate manner."
leo,2014-12-19,"You are taking your responsibilities so seriously today that it's tricky to find time for a bit of well-deserved fun. You might have the urge to cut loose for a while but you could end up returning to a mess. Procrastination is not your friend now, so shift into gear and get to work. But don't fret about finishing every job you start. The first steps are the hardest ones; once you set a consistent pace, the rest will fall into place without so much struggle on your part."
virgo,2014-12-19,"Staying on track at work is nearly impossible today because you are aware of so many exciting possibilities ahead. However, you may scare yourself with such a vast array of choices, prompting you to do nothing at all for fear of failure. Understandably, the big picture could be overwhelming if you can't break it down into smaller and more manageable tasks. Thankfully, proactively scaling back your plans before they get overly complicated saves you from unnecessary headaches later on."
libra,2014-12-19,"You cannot avoid your domestic responsibilities today, especially if you made promises that you must keep. Thankfully, your commitment to following through with your obligations doesn't have to prevent you from having some fun along the way. You can turn the most mundane tasks into totally fascinating diversions now with a simple change of attitude. Let your creativity shine, even while attending to routine chores. Whistle while you work."
scorpio,2014-12-19,"Your fiscal condition may be on the upswing, but don't let this good fortune be an excuse to spend money before it's in your bank account. You still have a fair amount of work to finish now before you reap the tangible rewards you seek, so wait to count your chickens until after they hatch. It's easy to be tempted by good news before it arrives, but remember that there aren't any quick shortcuts to achieving success."
sagittarius,2014-12-19,"You receive a cosmic boost of energy when the evocative Moon bounces into your fiery sign this afternoon, lifting your spirits and reconnecting you with your heart. Nevertheless, this isn't a smart time to become complacent because you still must be extra-diligent in order to overcome the challenges ahead. Luckily, your growing confidence enhances your ability to handle nearly any situation that arises. Believing in yourself is half the battle."
capricorn,2014-12-19,"You're a study in paradox today because you can be wildly optimistic and extremely pessimistic at the very same time. Normally, these opposing viewpoints would cancel each other out, leaving you somewhere in the middle. But now you're able to hold onto a positive perspective, even if you're less certain about specific aspects of your life. Ultimately, it's your more ambitious side that motivates you to create change. Putting in the hard work is still necessary if you want to climb the ladder of success."
aquarius,2014-12-19,"You realize how much you can accomplish if you join forces with others who share your beliefs. Fortunately, your spiritual approach to life combines well with your desire to connect with like-minded individuals now that the uplifting Sagittarius Moon is traveling through your 11th House of Groups. No matter how this extroverted social energy plays out, it's time to make the most out of this moment by participating in something that's larger than your individual story."
pisces,2014-12-19,"Maintaining a healthy balance between your professional and personal worlds is less complicated today if you honor the feelings of your friends and family. In fact, it's nearly impossible to keep emotions out of the workplace now that the moody Moon is visiting your 10th House of Public Responsibility. But nurturing those you love isn't just about smothering them with affection. A simple act of unconditional support might be enough to encourage others to step out of their shells and shine."
aries,2014-12-20,"Risking your emotional security seems like a worthwhile gamble today, but an unsuccessful shortcut might require you to go back over the same territory until you learn your lesson. Unfortunately, you may be so entranced by the current excitement that you can't remember your past mistakes. You can trick yourself into believing there's a quick fix when there's none to be found. There's no way around it; the road to success will take time and hard work. A change in attitude will do you a world of good."
taurus,2014-12-20,"You might start the day assuming it won't be  hard to ignore your unconventional desires today because you don't want to jeopardize your standing within your family or community. However, denying your true feelings doesn't help matters one bit. Sensual Venus squares rebellious Uranus, turning your down-to-earth tastes into more eclectic attractions. Share your feelings with a trusted friend before you do something you regret. Walking on the wild side could be fun, but tempering your actions with common sense keeps you from going over the edge."
gemini,2014-12-20,"You are often more flexible in your attitude than most of your friends, and today you could take your mental gymnastics to an entirely new level. You can get on other people's nerves now because you want to leave so many options open. You may be afraid that making a commitment too soon prevents you from being available for a better opportunity later. However, waiting too long might actually cause you to miss something deeply satisfying that is right in front of your nose. Stop thinking so much and trust your instincts instead."
cancer,2014-12-20,"You are not eager to jeopardize the stability of your relationships for the fleeting possibility of an amazing experience. Nevertheless, you're attracted to engaging in unconventional behavior, even if it places a strain on your social life. Keep in mind that you can still accept your current desires if they are outside of your comfort zone. Acknowledging an irrational urge doesn't mean that you must act on it. Exploring all the alternatives in the safety of your imagination may be enough to satisfy your current curiosity."
leo,2014-12-20,"You are riding a wave of adrenaline that makes you feel fully alive, but you may grow tired of getting bounced around by your crazy desires today. One minute you're singing the praises of a romance, and the next you're wondering about the wisdom of your heart. These extreme swings of attraction and uncertainty will pass if you don't overreact with emotions on either end of the spectrum. Enjoy the rush, but don't let your relationships suffer in the process."
virgo,2014-12-20,"You might become temporarily tongue-tied today as your desires lead you into uncharted territory. Instead of eagerly exploring your emotions, you're tempted to sidestep what's in your heart, believing it's easier to maintain a detached perspective when you stay in your head. However, you could inadvertently bring on the emotional meltdown you're trying so desperately to avoid unless you're willing to step beyond the limits of your rational thoughts and into the realm of feelings. There's no use in fighting the inevitable; embrace the unknown."
libra,2014-12-20,Your serious approach to relationships may not take you where you want to go today because unpredictable Uranus can turn your life inside out as it squares romantic Venus. Your current plans aren't as sensible as you think and your irrational behavior creates a series of events that require you to change direction suddenly. Be open to the excitement that comes from trying new things and meeting new people. Maintaining your center of gravity frees you to explore other worlds outside of your regular sphere of experience.
scorpio,2014-12-20,"You don't mind spending a little extra cash on something that helps you express your feelings toward a special friend. You won't likely purchase anything that is ordinary because your tastes are more eccentric than usual now. Buying a unique gift can be a joyful experience as long as you keep the other person's needs in mind rather than getting something that you would secretly like for yourself. No matter what you give, it's really the sentiment that matters most."
sagittarius,2014-12-20,"You are torn between pursuing the thrill of adventure and settling in for a relaxing day at home. You want to do both now and may grow annoyed when others pressure you to make a choice. However, micromanaging your day won't necessarily lead to your satisfaction; ironically, you might be happier today if you let others decide your current fate. You could end up feeling a real sense of exhilaration once you let go of the reins of control. Surprisingly, soaring on the current winds gives you more freedom than you think."
capricorn,2014-12-20,"You might feel like you're going to get into trouble for playing outside of the rules when it comes to love and relationships. Normally, Venus' journey through your sign motivates you to follow a conservative path of the heart, but her square to wild Uranus thrusts you into new territory now. Letting go of old patterns expands your horizons in ways you can't imagine. You won't be disappointed if you take a risk today; spread your wings and fly."
aquarius,2014-12-20,"You can't help but wonder how far you can stretch reality before something snaps while resourceful Venus squares outrageous Uranus. You want to do something crazy that makes you stand out in a crowd, but you may go overboard with your antics today. Friends could be shocked by your sudden uncharacteristic behavior and might criticize your actions. Remember, being brilliantly creative often leads to being misunderstood. Don't worry about how others judge you; your unique brand of genius is your greatest strength."
pisces,2014-12-20,"You are fascinated by eccentric people today, especially if you have been showing self-restraint in your own personal expression. The more radical your actions are now, the less you need everyone else to play out your suppressed feelings. You have an excellent opportunity to experiment with what you want, within reason, of course, so try something outrageous; you can always return to your old ways tomorrow without any regrets. Seize the moment and run."
aries,2014-12-21,"Persuading someone to change their feelings through coercion or empty promises is not a viable way to get what you want today. A smarter strategy is to let go of control and surrender to your emotions now. The ambitious New Moon falls in your 10th House of Career, requiring a brand new approach to your responsibilities. Though compromise isn't normally your style, calculated actions alone will only box you in. Take a chance and express what's in your heart."
taurus,2014-12-21,"Your emotions run particularly deep today but you should be able to maintain your sense of balance, nonetheless. People may not even realize that your feelings are in turmoil because you can appear calm, cool and collected as long as you keep your mind on the business at hand. However, the Capricorn New Moon stirs the energy of your 9th House of Future Vision and you cannot suppress your dreams for adventure. Let your passions rise to the surface without fearing the outcome; you'll gain more self-assurance if you don't try to hide your heart from view."
gemini,2014-12-21,"You may be more emotional today than others think because you bury your feelings so well that everything seems normal. Nevertheless, your closest friends can still tell something is brewing beneath the surface as the Capricorn New Moon rattles your 8th House of Intimacy and Transformation. You might be happily surprised if you overcome your own resistance and share your inner process with a trustworthy confidant. What happens next is up to you; you can keep swimming in shallow waters or you can dive in the deep end for maximum impact."
cancer,2014-12-21,"You gain inner strength by exploring options on your path to emotional satisfaction, but it's tricky to do this work on your own. Thankfully, someone special could bring you a much-needed dose of objectivity now that the Capricorn New Moon highlights your 7th House of Relationships. Unfortunately, the feedback you receive might not substantiate your original perspective. Processing your changing feelings quickly enables you to integrate an entirely new way of looking at the current circumstances."
leo,2014-12-21,"You have a number of loose ends to tie up, yet you may work yourself into an anxious state by trying to beat an arbitrary deadline. Your struggles might indicate there's a more complex set of issues at play now that the Capricorn Moon activates your 6th House of Daily Routine. Although your unrelenting drive could become obsessive, it's perfectly acceptable to leave some chores unfinished today. You don't have to impress anyone with your competence; just do your best and call it a day."
virgo,2014-12-21,"You believe that your decisions are rational and you're willing to debate anyone who has the audacity to question your choices. However, the Capricorn New Moon's presence in your 5th House of Self-Expression suggests your protests are misplaced. Don't waste energy justifying your practical approach; just admit what you want and move on. You have a much better shot at satisfaction if you don't try to convince others that your way is the best. Deciding which path to take is less critical than maintaining your integrity along the way."
libra,2014-12-21,"It may be rather inconvenient when sudden waves of desire crash onto the shores of your awareness today. Your first impulse is to reinforce your emotional boundaries as the conservative Capricorn New Moon falls in your 4th House of Security. However, your ruling planet Venus is currently in cahoots with dark Pluto, conjuring up a powerful mixture of innocent love and ruthless passion. Don't close down in fear; a soulful interaction can take you to a magical and mysterious place if you remain open to the beauty that's all around you now."
scorpio,2014-12-21,"Containing your emotions is no small feat now that the Capricorn New Moon lands in your 3rd House of Communication. Your need to express your desires with incisive clarity and unwavering determination is triggered by passionate Pluto's dance with sensual Venus today, amplifying your feelings of love or lust. Life is especially sweet if you connect with a willing playmate or partner, but unrealistic expectations can blind you to something special that's right in front of your nose."
sagittarius,2014-12-21,"You could have big plans for a great escape, but you sadly realize that there are more pressing things to do as you get closer to the time to leave. Your fiscal affairs demand your attention now that the Capricorn New Moon focuses on your 2nd House of Finances. But don't get lost in your dreams of the future; make a serious commitment and get to work. Take tangible steps, however little they may be, toward achieving your long-term goals."
capricorn,2014-12-21,"Navigating intense emotional territory is second nature for you today as the Capricorn New Moon camps out in your sign. You intuitively know that going deeper helps to create a stronger foundation upon which to build a relationship. However, you don't want to react irrationally because you're afraid that you could lose control of the situation. The journey to love is a complicated one, but facing your own resistance to intimacy might be the hardest part. Open your heart and let the chips fall where they may."
aquarius,2014-12-21,"Today you're motivated by a desire to show someone how much you know.  However, the Capricorn New Moon energizes your 12th House of Spiritual Mystery, drawing you into metaphysical realms. You will gain more from this spiritual experience if you can admit that whatever is happening is beyond your current comprehension. It's time to get out of your head and into your heart because that is where the real action is today."
pisces,2014-12-21,"It's easy to tell who your real friends are because they tend to show up with emotional support when you need them the most. But the reserved Capricorn New Moon's presence in your 11th House of Social Networking indicates you may prefer more cerebral interactions now, based on logic not passion. Nevertheless, you're still pleasantly surprised when someone comes through with the goods. Expressing your vulnerability enables you to be open enough to receive the assistance that's kindly offered."
aries,2014-12-22,"You're often the one who waits until the absolute last minute and then squeaks in under the deadline. But every moment counts now so make a concentrated effort to find your stride early in the day. The sooner you begin a project today, the longer you can sustain a high level of productivity. But starting out of the gate quickly makes sense only if you're willing to set a manageable pace that you can maintain until you reach the finish line."
taurus,2014-12-22,"You're so eager to finalize the planning for an upcoming adventure that you could create problems later on by rushing the process today. Fortunately, there aren't many limits on what is possible if you are methodical in your research prior to initiating action. There's no need to fear thinking large as long as you keep bringing your ideas down to earth. The truth is you won't always feel so disciplined, so make your dreams come true by taking advantage of this energy while it lasts."
gemini,2014-12-22,"You are very determined to get to the source of a feeling that has shaped your desires for a while. But this compulsion is no lighthearted passing whim; you're committed to understanding your psyche no matter how long it takes. Although you could be motivated by irrational drives today, there's no reason to let go of anything that adds meaning to your life. Exploring your shadows may not be your usual cup of tea, but it can impact your closest relationships in a positive manner."
cancer,2014-12-22,"Your boss may be critical of your easygoing attitude at work today. However, you're wise to listen to what you're told, even if you're tempted to ignore the advice. Learning a lesson from someone who is a harsh taskmaster can be challenging because you might want to withdraw and avoid what feels like a personal attack. Nevertheless, staying open to the feedback now teaches you how to improve your game and be even more productive. A wise person knows when to be quiet and listen."
leo,2014-12-22,"Although you're tempted to escape into a lovely dreamworld now, you need to be more focused than ever when it comes to your work. Your unrestrained fantasies fuel your confidence, but they also act as distractions from the serious tasks at hand. You might not want to pay attention to so many details today, but overcoming your own resistance is the first step toward achieving your goals in the weeks ahead. Finding personal satisfaction in a job well done touches your soul in a way that fleeting pleasure never will."
virgo,2014-12-22,"Establishing a methodical work pace is crucial now, for uneven progress sets you up for failure. Luckily, your perceptions are extremely sharp and you are able to accurately estimate the time and resources required to finish a task. Prioritizing your goals is a good place to start today. Once you have a practical strategy in mind, forge ahead with all the determination you can muster. Fortunately, effective planning allows you to manifest your dreams sooner than you think."
libra,2014-12-22,"It feels uncommonly good to be so certain about your goals today. You have a strong sense of purpose and you know what needs to be done next. Luckily, encountering a minor setback or two won't prevent you from reaching your destination. Still, you must tread carefully or an emotional melodrama might lure you off your path. Avoiding complex strategies and trusting your intuition will produce positive results."
scorpio,2014-12-22,"Your ideas can be so outrageous now that it's impossible to tell if they are grounded in any semblance of reality. Nevertheless, it's essential to distinguish between what is real and what is not. Set aside any unattainable goals so you can accomplish something tangible that has lasting value. There's no need to impress the world with your creative brilliance today; there's more value in making solid progress toward building for the future."
sagittarius,2014-12-22,"Applying the proper amount of control may be tricky business today, but over-managing a situation could lead to an emotional quagmire. Taking a back seat now motivates others to play a more significant role in the decision-making process. Allowing your coworkers to share leadership responsibilities can make tough obstacles easier to overcome in the days ahead. Proceed with caution until the universe gives you a green light. In the meantime, sit back and enjoy the ride."
capricorn,2014-12-22,"Nothing is simple today with five planets crowded into your conscientious sign. You can feel the weight of the world sitting squarely on your shoulders and you're growing weary of supporting everyone around you. The good news is you don't have to accept the authoritative role that's being placed on you now. Demonstrate your wisdom by encouraging others to discover their own paths to success. Even if you can run the show on your own, it's ideal when each person is motivated to contribute to the common goal in his or her own way."
aquarius,2014-12-22,"Your most memorable dreams are steering you toward practical solutions today as the pragmatic Capricorn Moon visits your 12th House of Imagination, bringing your fantasies down to earth. But clinging to old assumptions could stand between you and any future success you might envision. Just as the caterpillar cannot look back to imagine its next phase as a butterfly, neither can you know what's ahead by looking over you shoulder to your past. Cut loose from the past and embrace the future."
pisces,2014-12-22,"You long to dream about the distant horizon while the Moon moves through your 11th House of Long-Term Goals. But there's no time now to relax and let your imagination take you on a magic carpet ride. Instead, be proactive and rebuild your life one concrete step at a time. Planning is only useful as long as you are willing to get to work right away. Remember that you're not alone on your journey; enlisting the help of supportive friends empowers you to manage your current business while still reaching for the stars."
aries,2014-12-23,"You don't want to slow down for anyone today, but you wisely understand that expending too much energy to make insignificant gains isn't such a great idea. You're being challenged to accomplish everything that you set out to do now. However, it's best to act methodically rather than frantically fighting an uphill battle. Instead of attempting to finish what you begin, just lay a solid foundation for what's to follow. Work smarter, not harder."
taurus,2014-12-23,"You might be upset today when you finally realize how much you have sacrificed to get what you want. However, your decision has already been made and there's no turning back now. Although you may wish that you did things differently, you have another important choice to make in the present moment. Don't let your feelings of regret trick you into overreacting. Calculate your chances for long-term success before taking a risk just to prove a point. Trust the process and breathe."
gemini,2014-12-23,"Finding time to socialize with your friends is difficult now that your workweek is underway, but you still want to indulge in a little fun, anyhow. Instead of trying to squeeze everything into your schedule, you can benefit the most from taking a methodical approach today. Establish priorities early in the day and then stick to your plan. Luckily, you're such a natural at multitasking that you could get enough done to justify celebrating your accomplishments later on."
cancer,2014-12-23,"If you recently had to acquiesce to an authority figure, it's time to grab the reins and reassert control of your life today. Finally, it's your turn to play the role of the fearless leader; your failure to claim your power only leaves room for someone less qualified to take charge. Fortunately, you can act with compassion, so there's no need to be critical of anyone just because you're shifting the dynamics. It's crucial to seize the moment and stand up for your beliefs. If you don't do it now, no one else will do it for you."
leo,2014-12-23,"Your nerves can get the best of you today if you are working hard to put a relationship in order. Even if you made inroads recently, there still may be something that's not exactly right. Although you could feel overwhelmed with all the stress, don't throw in the towel just yet. You have already come through the hardest part, but it will take more time to see how much progress has already occurred. Sometimes the best possible medicine, besides laughter, is the passage of time."
virgo,2014-12-23,"Getting closure on a creative project is a high priority now, even if you prefer it not to end just yet. Reassessing the recent changes you made at home or at work makes practical sense, but reconsider what you can do to improve the quality of your life before you initiate further action. Don't try to tackle the bigger issues now; just concentrate on cherishing the little things that bring you joy right now."
libra,2014-12-23,"You might have an uneasy feeling left over from a recent emotional entanglement you had with a family member or an intimate partner. Everything seemed to be patched up and on the mend, but now you are realizing that your preferences have been left out of the equation. Unfortunately, this scenario may have a familiar ring to it. Obviously, the conversation isn't quite over. Remember, your needs are just as important as anyone else's; speak up or forever hold your piece."
scorpio,2014-12-23,"Your resolute nature sees you through some sticky situations time and time again. Once you've made up your mind, it's relatively simple to do what must be done. Nevertheless, something could happen in your immediate environment today that tests you in a way you weren't expecting. However, you can rise to the occasion if you truly believe in yourself and are willing to go the extra mile now. Don't back down; you are closer to victory than you think."
sagittarius,2014-12-23,"Your boss isn't in the mood to acknowledge your needs so you might have to overcome his or her resistance if the Moon's alignment with restrictive Saturn puts you in direct conflict with an authority figure. Your smartest strategy is to consciously moderate your own intensity to give others the time and space to recover any lost equilibrium. For now, less is actually better than more when asking for what you want. You can prove your worthiness by simply demonstrating your commitment to the cause."
capricorn,2014-12-23,"Your suppressed emotions may stand between you and your happiness today, but unconsciously expressing negativity might also bring you down. However, you can begin to transmute your awkward feelings into positive actions by shifting your perspective into one of empowerment. Your confidence returns when you see that there are more options available than you thought. But don't fall victim to taking an unnecessary risk just for the adrenaline rush; making your choices based on practicality offers the best path to lasting satisfaction."
aquarius,2014-12-23,"You feel as if you're in the final stages of preparation, but surprisingly you might not know what you're getting ready for yet. It's probably too late to reconsider your plans for the week, so just go with the flow the best you can. But you have more power at your disposal than you realize. Don't talk yourself out of success; instead, pick a cause, set your priorities and get down to business. If your commitment is authentic, others can't help but recognize you as a force to be reckoned with and will treat you with the respect you deserve."
pisces,2014-12-23,"Your interactions with others seem so stressful today that you may consider making a quick escape before anyone has a chance to stop you. However, working alone or playing solo is not the best use of the emotional Moon's current visit to your 11th House of Teamwork. Your participation in a social group could be quite liberating now if you can just push past your own resistance. The whole is greater than the sum of its parts."
aries,2014-12-24,"Your ability to get things done quickly tempts you to take on more responsibilities than you can possibly finish. However, your holiday spirit may run into trouble if you overextend your reach today. Instead of thinking that you need to convert every intellectual breakthrough into tangible results, just allow your brilliant ideas to come and go like the tides. Visualize yourself standing on the shores of awareness, but remember that you don't have to capture every individual wave to make your mark."
taurus,2014-12-24,"You're waiting for something big to happen, yet whatever it is remains just out of reach. You may attempt to calm your nerves, but your restlessness lingers until you accept that the resistance comes from your own attitude. Fortunately, the tension disperses when you begin to let go of control. Don't waste energy concentrating on too many specific details of the day; spend time focusing on your long-term goals instead. Ironically, aiming your attention at a point on the distant horizon has a positive impact on the present moment."
gemini,2014-12-24,"Following through on anything that you start now may be a challenge, but you won't likely be bothered about it for too long. You suddenly forget about what you were doing as soon as you are distracted by another amazing idea. Your erratic behavior might be upsetting to others today, yet you'll probably continue scattering your energy until you see the error of your ways. Ultimately, obtaining closure on unfinished business improves your reputation and raises your confidence in the process."
cancer,2014-12-24,"Although you wish relationship dynamics were simpler, it feels as if you built your day on shifting sands. Thankfully, you might be able to change the energy faster than you thought possible by just telling the truth today. Don't hold back; even if your life is turned upside down for a while, it will settle back on the solid foundation that you need. Have the courage to throw caution to the wind when it comes to following your heart."
leo,2014-12-24,"You think that you know what you want today, but the current circumstances keep changing. Just as you become comfortable with one perspective, everything shifts and you need to readjust your expectations. Your willingness to be flexible could prevent a serious headache. However, too much thinking now can get in the way of your best interests. Observe the current interpersonal dynamics and respond with your heart, not your head."
virgo,2014-12-24,"Assimilating so much information may be a bit overwhelming now, especially if you believe you already have the answers to lingering questions. Your key planet Mercury is buzzing today, yet the more stuck you are in your thinking, the louder the static is from electrical Uranus. Thankfully, your readiness for change empowers you to explore the outer limits of your imagination. Remember that you don't have to push your thought process over the edge; your evolving perspective is all you need to get the most out of your journey."
libra,2014-12-24,"Your mind is currently operating at an incredibly high speed, yet you wonder if you're capable of keeping it up throughout the entire day. You naturally assume that the flow of information will eventually slow down, but other people continue to introduce more complications. The hectic pace is fun at first, but might become more exhausting as the day goes on. Don't try to do everything all at once. Extending your thinking into the future can help you remain calmer in the present."
scorpio,2014-12-24,"You are possessed with self-confidence today, especially if someone you trust expresses approval of your performance. Although unpredictable Uranus can set off a strike of lighting that rattles your current routine, cosmic assistance seems to arrive just in the nick of time. As long as you're willing to shift gears quickly, you should be able to make good use of the new information that arrives at your door now. Letting go of old assumptions clears the way for an exciting new direction."
sagittarius,2014-12-24,"You're able to accomplish so much today that others might start to think you're a super-hero. However, there's a steep price to pay for your action-packed day. So many events are interrelated now that one unexpected blip can bring down the entire house of cards. But even a crisis or two won't stop you if you're open to starting over again and changing your course as needed. Your sheer determination is a marvel to behold."
capricorn,2014-12-24,"You may hope that everything will calm down, but you probably won't have a chance to catch your breath for a couple of days. You are called back into action today and you must show up ready to hold up your end of the deal. Fortunately, mental Mercury's current stay in your ambitious sign indicates that you're up for the task. You don't have time to waste; face the current challenges with a fierce resolve and a can-do attitude. Climbing mountains is what you Mountain Goats do best."
aquarius,2014-12-24,"Although your thoughts are integrally tied to your future, today's planetary cluster in your 12th House of Escapism triggers your desire to fly under the radar with minimum impact. Nevertheless, you have no choice but to let go of your isolationist tendencies since electric Uranus zaps you out of your secret fantasy world. Overcome your fears and face the brave new world that's right around the next corner. You might not be able to see what's coming, but if you're willing to take a calculated risk the rewards will follow."
pisces,2014-12-24,"You don't have to convince others that your plan is the best one; you only need to communicate your ideas with honesty and integrity. There are no correct or incorrect points of view now, just differing ones. Even if your opinions are out of the box, others respect you for describing exactly where you stand. Nevertheless, you must demonstrate your sincerity by listening to other people's positions. Keeping an open mind is the key to making the best choices for everyone involved."
aries,2014-12-25,"Acknowledging your feelings may be a real struggle today because they interfere with your original agenda. Fortunately, your self-esteem is strong enough to handle some very intense self-examination now that can bring your personal objectives into greater focus. But the real lesson today isn't about your emotional growth; it's about balancing your need to meet existing responsibilities with your desire to create more meaningful relationships. Spend time with those you love and leave your worries behind."
taurus,2014-12-25,You could be so convinced that you're heading in the right direction now that you're surprised if something happens to make you reconsider a recent decision. This isn't the smartest time to exhibit your infamous bullheadedness or you might short circuit your current process of discovery. Reassess relevant information that you previously dismissed as unimportant. This is your chance to see things in a new light; the truth will set you free.
gemini,2014-12-25,"People may believe that you're only interested in clever one-liners and witty repartee, but the truth is that you're determined to get to the bottom of an enigma today. Mischievous Mercury joins up with ruthless Pluto in your 8th House of Deep Sharing, driving you to uncover the facts. You think that knowing the entire story will have a positive effect on your relationships. Although gathering more data usually keeps you happy, you already have enough information to start an important conversation. Sharing your feelings is a small price to pay for the honesty you seek."
cancer,2014-12-25,"You wonder why people are pushing your emotional buttons today, even if you're showering them with love. But you may have unexpressed feelings that are being reflected back at you through the actions of others. If someone seems too demanding, looking in the mirror might reveal your own unfulfilled needs. It's only natural to suppress your negativity in order to get into the holiday spirit; however, burying your true desires adversely impacts the behavior of those close to you. Ultimately, the most supportive path you can take now is one that's based on transparency and love."
leo,2014-12-25,"Once you become fixated on a particular fantasy today, it's nearly impossible to get it out of your mind. However, this kind of obsessive thinking is problematic only if it distracts you from your promises. But turning into a perfectionist when it comes to family obligations isn't a good idea because you might drive everyone crazy with your uncharacteristic attention to details. Thankfully, you can contribute to the holiday spirit by moderating your extreme emotional reactions. Channeling your energy into creating peace and harmony brings everyone closer together."
virgo,2014-12-25,"You are usually critical in your analysis of a situation yet your mental acuity is focused on recreational endeavors today. However, your key planet Mercury runs into perceptive Pluto in your 5th House of Self-Expression, intensifying relationships and sharpening the edges of your messages. Choose your words carefully because most everything you say now carries the extra weight of passion. Relying on your sense of humor is the perfect antidote for the tricky dynamics of the day."
libra,2014-12-25,"You're not comfortable letting everyone know how you feel because you don't like to rock the boat. Perhaps you believe that people won't be able to handle your radical honesty today -- and maybe you are right. But you need to examine the emotional price you pay if you keep quiet to protect someone you love from your observations. It's not in anyone's best interest to filter out difficult subjects, but it's wise to consider the impact of your message before you speak. Practicing the art of compassionate discretion allows everyone to enjoy the magic of the moment."
scorpio,2014-12-25,"You are usually at home with emotional intensity, but this doesn't mean that anyone else wants to hash out their hidden feelings today. You may act as a catalyst that starts a dramatic reaction today, making others wary of your presence. But ignoring the truth or watering it down to make it more palatable won't work either. Although there's no reason to dwell on the dark side, everyone is counting on you to tell it like it is. Your greatest blessing now is the brilliant clarity of your intentions, but it's only a gift if you have the courage to share it."
sagittarius,2014-12-25,"Your exuberant nature mixes with today's brooding emotional intensity like oil and water. However, you're not quite ready to relinquish your optimism because you have exciting plans that inspire you to anticipate life's next great adventure. Unfortunately, nothing is as simple and straightforward as you thought. Positive results are stifled as long as you stoically cling to the past. The good news is that once you let go of your previous expectations, there's little that can stand between you and your happiness."
capricorn,2014-12-25,"You're not amused by someone's emotional disclosure today; in fact, you are tempted to walk away from an uncomfortable conversation before it gets heated. However, when pushed into a corner, you can connect with your inner resolve and stand up to anyone who is blocking your progress. You're itching to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Take a deep breath and remember the true meaning of the season. Even if it takes more effort to deliver your message with kindness, the results make it worthwhile."
aquarius,2014-12-25,"Although you might have strong spiritual beliefs, you aren't necessarily driven to share them today as communicator Mercury aligns with potent Pluto in your 12th House of Privacy. The reality is that your understanding of mysterious concepts such as soul consciousness may be beyond the comprehension of most people. Nevertheless, you're quite practical when it comes to participating in holiday celebrations, especially if fun and fellowship are involved. There's no reason to hold back; it's the season to be jolly."
pisces,2014-12-25,"You are usually quite comfortable navigating your way through the murky waters of family dynamics, but current circumstances may push you to your limit. It doesn't matter that it's a holiday because you're less interested in frivolity and fantasy today than you are in brute honesty. Unfortunately, the facts might not be easy to find during the holiday bustle. Don't fill in the gaps with your fertile imagination; work only with the actual information you have at your disposal. Once you are free of the emotional confusion, you can happily return to the real business of celebrating with those you love."
aries,2014-12-26,"Responsibilities pull you back into the real world today, even if you go kicking and screaming the whole way. Unfortunately, denial isn't an option now; you can't escape the obligations you have allowed to pile up. Thankfully, taking a mature approach to your commitments enables you to perform your earthly tasks while also pursuing more spiritual interests. Don't aim for an either/or solution to your dilemma; build your current strategy on inclusive thinking. A holistic philosophy empowers you to work simultaneously on multiple levels."
taurus,2014-12-26,"You might believe that your friends will bail you out today, only to discover that their previous commitments prevent them from coming through with the goods. However, your worries may be worse than the situation, itself. Your ship is not sinking and the immediate danger level is lower than you think. Instead of seeking external assistance, consider what you can do to help yourself. Making an attitude adjustment is a smart start; a metaphysical makeover is the fastest way to improve your entire world."
gemini,2014-12-26,"Visualizing yourself as King of the Mountain is not necessarily the most direct route to the summit. Naturally, your frame of mind is a crucial ingredient in any recipe for success, but your positive attitude alone won't do the trick today. Although you might prefer the easiest way to your destination, a shortcut won't save you time. Trying to outsmart reality could burn even more resources in the long run. Following the tried and true path now is your best bet for reaching your dreams."
cancer,2014-12-26,Your imagination is a significant source of inspiration today and anything you can do to cultivate it helps your cause. Writing down your dreams as soon as you wake up is one way to help keep them in your memory. Making time to meditate or daydream may also put you in touch with important messages from your subconscious. There's no need to worry if you can't understand everything that floats into your awareness now; just continue to explore your feelings and let the symbols unfold their story at their own speed.
leo,2014-12-26,"You may not be ready to let go of the holiday spirit yet, but avoiding your responsibilities could spin your day out of control. Take all your commitments seriously today, even if you promised more than you can possibly deliver. Thankfully, you can see through complicated cross-currents and cut to the chase. Four hardworking Capricorn planets are taking care of business in your 6th House of Daily Routine, urging you to pace yourself, proceed with determination and be sure to produce tangible results along the way."
virgo,2014-12-26,"Other people may appear to be the source of your confusion now as you try to understand their true motives. On one hand, you could be inspired by the compassionate behavior of someone you admire, only to realize that their actions don't fully support their story. On the other hand, you might feel as if your behavior falls short when compared to the altruistic intentions of a friend. However, getting lost in analysis is just a way to avoid the real issue. It's not a competition; the true measure of your conduct is how you stack up against your own expectations."
libra,2014-12-26,You might have such high hopes about what you want to accomplish today that you set yourself up for failure before you do a thing. It's frustrating to believe your diplomatic efforts will resolve a long-lasting feud between two people you care about when they won't even make an effort themselves. But you still can have a positive impact on the lives of those closest to you by radiating your feelings of love and visions of world peace. Global issues are best tackled by acting locally with the best of intentions.
scorpio,2014-12-26,"Your  joie de vivre is contagious today as you demonstrate your ability to trust in the flow of the cosmos. Instead of worrying about issues that are out of your control, you prefer to spread good vibes by finding happiness in simple pleasures. Going for a walk with a friend, working on a creative project or just kicking back with a loved one is a definite step in the right direction. Those closest to you will be positively influenced by your inspirational attitude if your actions are in tune with your heart."
sagittarius,2014-12-26,"Family dynamics are more complicated than they seem today, especially if you are trying to keep things upbeat and lighthearted. You don't want to be the heavy one, yet unexpressed emotions lurk just beneath the surface and only gain in intensity if you continue to ignore them. However, your willingness to forgive others could be a key to resolving the current stress. Talking about your feelings isn't nearly as scary as you think as long as you don't blame anyone else in the process. Ultimately, you can be a hero by shifting the energy and beginning the healing process."
capricorn,2014-12-26,"Your practical nature typically prompts you to base your decisions on just the facts. However, you may be better off taking a little vacation today and exploring the realms of poetry, fiction and music. Communication is simple if you don't get too hung up on the details now. Give everyone a bit of wiggle room, and take everything you hear now with a grain of salt. Your imagination can be the source of rich treasures if you're willing to step off the edge and leave the real world behind."
aquarius,2014-12-26,"You can't help but realize your values are changing today, leaving you with a bit of an identity crisis. Certain beliefs that have been a cornerstone of your world view might not be as immutable as you once thought. Even if your opinions are fixed in place, you can show your strength of character by remaining open to different ways of thinking. There's no urgency to reach a final conclusion now; just let the new information in and see where it takes you. Evolution doesn't happen overnight."
pisces,2014-12-26,"It's nearly impossible to contain your fantasies today as the evocative Moon lines up with surreal Neptune in your sign. On one hand, your spiritual inclinations are in focus; you can almost hear the heavenly choirs singing your song. On the other hand, you could easily confuse your dreams with reality. Either way, pay attention to what you let ripple through your mind because whatever you imagine might actually come to pass. Believing is seeing."
aries,2014-12-27,"As you gaze into the future, you realize you need to plan for a change in direction to conserve your resources. You might even consider going on a retreat, especially if you feel as if you're running on empty. Creating space for a bit of solitude can be challenging today, yet time alone is more valuable than you think. Ironically, the more complicated it is to schedule some downtime, the more you need it. Don't make excuses; just make it happen."
taurus,2014-12-27,"Naturally, you appreciate the need for making plans and following through with your commitments. But you may be weary of doing everything according to the book. However, your fantasies could inspire you to pursue your bliss today, rather than playing a supporting role in other people's stories as sweet Venus sparkles in your 9th House of Big Ideas. You have permission from the cosmos to reach for the stars as long as you know where to draw the line. Setting sensible limits gives you the freedom to let your imagination soar and your heart take flight."
gemini,2014-12-27,"You may be harboring resistance to your social obligations today. Nevertheless, you can muster up enough energy to fulfill your obligations once you make up your mind to do so. However, you still might be worried about losing your sense of identity if you become too involved with someone else's plans. Your biggest concern now is about having to justify your actions. But once you acknowledge that your fears are fabricated, you will be able to enjoy jumping into the flow of events without having to be in control."
cancer,2014-12-27,"You Crabs are pleased that the emotional tides are flowing, revitalizing your soul and empowering you to reconnect with your heart. Thankfully, the watery Pisces Moon can be a cosmic antidote for your recent sense of alienation in a significant relationship. You're all too eager to immerse yourself into the refreshing deep sea of feelings today, but others may not want to follow you on your underwater adventure. Nevertheless, spiritual rewards could be yours if you're willing to seek sunken treasure on your own."
leo,2014-12-27,"You take pride in being famous for creating a party wherever you go, but the Moon's current visit to your 8th House of Intimacy reveals a much darker part of your character. Oddly enough, today you're driven to raise complex issues that are without fast and easy solutions. You don't even mind the absence of a quick fix, since you understand that you're on a metaphysical journey. Expressing your heartfelt desires now can lead to profound discussions that ultimately solidify a meaningful relationship."
virgo,2014-12-27,"You quickly grow annoyed if others aren't as diligent as you are now as the Moon's presence in your 7th House of Companions emphasizes your partnerships. Unfortunately, your helpful assistance might be perceived as unsolicited criticism. Don't try to solve anyone else's problems or change someone who falls short of your expectations. Instead, make adequate room for all the imperfections that you see around you, and allow those you love to be fully human. After all, you would want the same respect in return."
libra,2014-12-27,"You have many chores to finish around your home today, but you don't exactly know where to start. You might think that making a list will help you focus, but even that could prove to be a daunting task. Although over-planning your day is tempting, it's much wiser to stay flexible without thinking too far ahead. Just jump in without further analysis and pay attention to the subtle signs you see everywhere in your environment. Trust the universe and let your intuition guide you through the day."
scorpio,2014-12-27,"Sharing laughter brings healing with the Moon traveling through your 5th House of Enjoyment, but a long-forgotten family memory may distract you from the good times. Thankfully, your private matters don't have to interfere with your fun today if you manage your emotions efficiently. Whereas you often have trouble discerning your head from your heart, staying aware of your feelings now allows you to process them discreetly, without others having to know your internal struggle. Don't let your past get in the way of appreciating the joy of the present moment."
sagittarius,2014-12-27,"Your unwavering optimism hides fears and tears today but you might feel helpless if you can't control your emotions. Your first inclination is to simply avoid conversations that tread into uncomfortable territory, rather than trying to process your angst. The truth is that you may experience unexpected relief once you express what's in your heart. An immediate resolution could be elusive, but at least everyone will know where you stand. Navigating unknown waters is much easier when you don't do it alone."
capricorn,2014-12-27,"The more you attempt to gain mastery over your daily routine now, the harder it is to keep all the pieces in place. Satisfaction may be tough to find today, but all is not lost. Setting your sights on the task at hand is currently more productive than thinking about the larger perspective. Wait for the dust to settle before turning your life upside down; it's amazing how different things will look in just a few days."
aquarius,2014-12-27,"You may grow discouraged today if your dreams seem out of reach. However, you might be viewing your present circumstances from a perspective that's too narrow. You will likely come out on the losing end if you compare the hard, cold facts of your life with your idealistic dreams. Instead, accept the differences between your reality and your fantasies as a starting point. Map out the steps you need to take to reach your destination and then embark on your journey with a beginner's mind and an open heart."
pisces,2014-12-27,"The cosmic energy shifts and your network of friends and family may be the primary source of your concerns now. Conflicting emotions make it tricky business to negotiate the ups and downs of social dynamics, whether you have too much or not enough on your plate. Cut yourself some slack while your moods are in flux until the reflective Moon leaves your sign tomorrow. In the meantime, postpone big decisions while doing what you must to keep everything afloat. Keeping your sense of humor close at hand enables you to sail through the day."
aries,2014-12-28,"Rushing into a situation without any forethought sounds perfectly fine to you, especially since the Moon returns to your impetuous sign early this morning. Unfortunately, your reckless behavior could arouse strong reactions from friends and acquaintances. Although it's wise to wait it out and see how you feel in a couple of days, you might not be able to resist the excitement of embarking on something new. If your sense of urgency gets the best of you, at least temper your actions so you don't create too much chaos."
taurus,2014-12-28,"You're annoyed by your own impatience because you're not sure if beginning a new project now is such a good idea. You might try to talk yourself out of doing anything at all today, but this lazy attitude only adds to your frustration. However, if you blindly forge ahead you're likely to run into strong opposition. Ultimately, listening to logic and tying up loose ends before doing anything else makes more sense than reacting in an extreme manner. Finish the old before you start the new."
gemini,2014-12-28,"You're eager to embrace the future instead of reviewing your recent past once again. Nevertheless, there are emotional obstacles that must be overcome now before you can put your new plans into action. Attempts to avoid the issues are futile; denial only strengthens the resistance, for the problems will resurface later with greater intensity. Slow down and face the music. Learning a valuable lesson prepares you to take your game to the next level."
cancer,2014-12-28,"Relationship issues continue to be a source of stress, making it nearly impossible to fulfill all the demands of your close friends and family. You may feel as if you're caught in the crosscurrents today and that you will let someone down, no matter which path you choose. Thankfully, there's another way around this obstacle course. Balancing the complex social dynamics isn't easy, but creating a friendly and fair environment is your best bet. Show others respect by telling the truth and letting them know your limits before things get out of hand."
leo,2014-12-28,"You're feeling like you're on top of the world today, especially if you have big ideas about the future. Unfortunately, your plans may be complicated by unstable circumstances and unreliable people who won't support your needs now. Don't place too much value on getting assistance from anyone else. Nevertheless, accept help when it's offered, even if you believe that you can succeed on your own. Learning to receive from others might not feel comfortable at first, but admitting you don't have all the answers opens the door to more authentic communication."
virgo,2014-12-28,"Sharing your feelings may not feel safe now, but the emotional roller coaster isn't as dangerous as you think. Relationships seem messy these days and you might even choose to sidestep interpersonal entanglements as much as possible. You're probably more dependent on others than you're willing to admit, so it's more sensible to acknowledge your desires without making anyone else responsible for your satisfaction. Your radical honesty could be enough to save the day."
libra,2014-12-28,"It's annoying if people make promises without subsequently delivering the goods. It's not as if you begged anyone to come to your rescue; chances are others just arrive out of the blue and offer to help. However, you don't want to rely on someone's good intentions. Even if you are left in the lurch, just move forward with your original plans without wasting time playing the blame game. Striking out on your own raises your confidence and demonstrates your independence to your peers."
scorpio,2014-12-28,"You want to show your competence and loyalty today by shining your light wherever you go. However, you have an eerie feeling that you're being judged by someone who doesn't really appreciate your contribution. Overcoming the disapproval -- yours or someone else's -- is your first order of business. Either way, ignoring the real issues can feel like a personal defeat. However, what other people think now is not your concern; your job is to stand your ground and be true to yourself no matter what."
sagittarius,2014-12-28,"Today begins with a bang and the energy continues to build right through the evening. You can sense the surge of creativity in the air, but you grow irritated with someone who tries to hijack your day with their personal agenda. You aren't interested in playing it safe just to avoid confrontation; it could feel exhilarating to push back and defend your territory. Just remember, there may be a price to pay for alienating an ally. Practicing the art of compromise might not be easy now, but it gives you the best chance for setting things right."
capricorn,2014-12-28,"You're struggling to balance your naturally conservative approach with an urgent desire to throw caution to the wind. You are anticipating an exciting time at a party with an entirely new group of people; however, you don't want to abandon your established network of friends. Ultimately, your choice may not be as significant as you think, as long as you take full responsibility for your decision. Expanding your horizons with a bit of experimentation is a great idea as long as you remain sensitive to those who are already an integral part of your life."
aquarius,2014-12-28,"You may try to sneak through the day without causing too much trouble, but you could raise a few eyebrows with your unconventional behavior. You want to experience life to the fullest now, and could attempt to pack so much into each moment that others grow tired just listening to your plans. Riding an adrenaline high is thrilling, but be careful not to take things too far. Even you might not be able to keep up with your crazy schedule. Taking a few deep breaths helps to settle your nerves so you can still be brilliant in your choices."
pisces,2014-12-28,"You have your own creative ideas about how you want to welcome in the New Year, but others may pressure you to change your mind. Unfortunately, there won't be any winners in a power struggle today. Even if you encounter resistance from your friends, continue to gently lobby for your plans. However, fulfilling your fantasies now might not be as important as you think. As long as your intentions are pure, you should be able to balance your individual needs with the desires of those closest to you. When push comes to shove, being with those you love matters most."
aries,2014-12-29,"You know exactly what you want today with the Aries Moon brightly reflecting your needs. But, unfortunately, sharing your heart's desires might not bring you any closer to satisfaction now if others don't understand what you're saying. Communication is tricky for a couple of days while trickster Mercury is orbiting under the influence of delusional Neptune. You can talk yourself into doing nearly anything, but keeping your feelings to yourself works in your favor. In the meantime, cultivate your future by giving yourself permission to dream."
taurus,2014-12-29,"Talking seems pointless today because you feel so transparent that others must already know what you're feeling. Thankfully, there are many ways to demonstrate your emotional warmth and although verbal communication might be the most obvious, it's not always the most effective. Acts of kindness toward those you admire will get your message across faster than any other method. Generous gestures without expectation of anything in return are the best gifts of all."
gemini,2014-12-29,"Your unrestrained enthusiasm could have significant impact on your partner or lover today. Nevertheless, long and drawn-out speeches are the wrong approach, unless you quickly follow through with tangible actions. Otherwise, people grow tired of your smooth words and empty promises if nothing happens. Remember that fulfilling your obligations doesn't necessarily require a lot of fanfare if your behavior is consistent with your goals. Channel your passion into your work."
cancer,2014-12-29,"It shouldn't be so hard to just let someone know how you feel today. Unfortunately, it's challenging to express yourself clearly now, leading people to think you're not being very sincere at all. This whole scenario may be frustrating, but you can avoid a big misunderstanding by sticking to the facts and simply speaking from your heart. Showing up with integrity trumps all other possible strategies."
leo,2014-12-29,"The pressure to choose now is unavoidable -- you don't know whether to call it quits or launch a major initiative. You may feel as if you're up against the wall with no way over it. Exploring all your options with your friends and listening to their feedback is the first step to making up your mind. But your words don't tell the whole story while fanciful Neptune tempts you to embellish your tale. However, keeping your message on point makes your version of the truth more believable and easier to support. Sharing your dilemma helps to clear the confusion from your path."
virgo,2014-12-29,"Your social diplomacy is a necessary ingredient to manage the emotional complexity of the day, especially if you are motivated to dig beneath the surface to discover your truth. But before you begin your quest, take time to invite someone to join you on your search. You can do it alone if you must, but everything will flow with greater ease if this is a shared effort. Nevertheless, don't just assume your point of view is the only one; ultimately, there's no right or wrong when it comes to matters of the heart."
libra,2014-12-29,"Too much dependency on a close friend or partner is a trap, yet it's still tempting to base your responses on how you think someone else will react. Forget about weighing and judging the impact of your words today; simply say them aloud as they enter your awareness. Your open-minded attitude makes all the difference now, so express yourself in a way that also conveys kindness and demonstrates flexibility. Others will be so appreciative of your authenticity that they won't even care if you agree with them or not."
scorpio,2014-12-29,"Approaching your work from a new angle today also alters the roles that others play in your life. But choosing your part is not a straightforward affair because your emotions are being pulled in many directions now. Instead of relying on a familiar old response, try gathering more information first. This radical strategy could also bring alternative choices to the table, offering you paths you haven't yet considered. A change will do you good."
sagittarius,2014-12-29,"Opening your heart may be scary business today because everything seems to be happening so quickly. But taking the easy way out by erecting self-protective walls only increases your loneliness and isn't your style, anyway. Instead, find an inner source of courage and share your feelings with someone you trust. Healing old wounds begins with first acknowledging the truth and then practicing the art of forgiveness, not just for others but also for yourself."
capricorn,2014-12-29,"Although you don't want to agitate dormant feelings of uncertainty, you're tired of walking on eggshells. Unfortunately, your self-enforced caution could have exactly the opposite effect from what you want. If your conflicted emotions become the topic of conversation today, don't hold back stating your true desires. Be as honest as you can while still remaining sensitive to all parties involved. Clearing the air allows everyone to have a fresh start."
aquarius,2014-12-29,"You're anticipating the prospects of exploring your feelings with an open mind as you move into a new emotional landscape today. However, you tend to be cooler with your words than how you actually feel in your heart. Oddly enough, it's easier to express your needs through bold actions now rather than writing or talking about them. Just walk your talk and you'll come out smelling like a rose."
pisces,2014-12-29,"You might be feeling quite proud about the inspiration you have to offer a close friend or associate today. Or, maybe you're just ready to act on a newly found sense of confidence by sharing your visions for the future. The bad news is that everyone won't likely react with the same level of enthusiasm right off the bat. Tell your story without trying to sell anyone anything if you want to persuade others to listen to your advice or support your dreams. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink."
aries,2014-12-30,"Sticking to a proven method brings better results today than trying a whole new approach. You may grow restless if everything seems too familiar; however, it's much smarter now to manage your anxiety by gradually modifying your attitude instead of randomly messing with your environment. Thankfully, once you settle into a routine, most everything should get easier to handle all around. Surprisingly, slow and steady change will be much more satisfying than you think."
taurus,2014-12-30,You may grow so concerned with executing your own agenda today that you could end up obsessing over something you want. Problems arise if other people's schedules conflict with yours. But you're not likely to take no for an answer since the Moon's return to your determined sign heightens your attachment to your preferred version of the outcome. Don't increase your frustration level by trying to alter the dynamics that are beyond your control. You can prevent your energy from getting stuck by simply allowing the tides of your emotions to carry you into new territory.
gemini,2014-12-30,"You might not be overly communicative today because you don't trust your ability to know when to stop talking. Thankfully, practicing self-restraint is an intelligent strategy since there are pressing issues that require your attention and it can be problematic if you wear yourself out too early in the game. Although pursuing random social activities is fun, don't let them distract you from the real work at hand. Maintaining your focus is key to your success."
cancer,2014-12-30,"This may be a perfect day to hang out with friends, but don't worry about figuring out too many of the details beforehand. You prefer to know your schedule in advance, but ultimately, it will be more enjoyable if you leave things unstructured for now. Oddly enough, everyone else seems to have specific plans even if you don't. Fortunately, all you need to do today is say yes. Everything else should fall into place without a lot of effort if you keep a flexible attitude."
leo,2014-12-30,"You have a very specific picture of what you want to accomplish at work today, but you could seriously miscalculate the amount of support you will receive. In fact, you are relying on everyone to stick close to your agenda, as promised. But the universe might have a slightly different notion about what's next and you're better off now if you don't fight the inevitable. Even if you are successful at forcing reality to fit into your plans, you may exhaust yourself in the process. Choosing your battles with care strengthens your chances to win the war."
virgo,2014-12-30,"This could turn out to be a rather mellow day if you don't fill up your schedule with too much unnecessary work. Instead of shifting into automatic gear and plowing through your long list of chores, consider which tasks are non-essential and leave those for another day. Even though you're typically a hard worker, take some well-deserved time off just to relax. Before making your resolutions, review the last year and reflect on the opportunities your future might bring."
libra,2014-12-30,"Your outlook on life is changing radically now, but you might not be able to set your ideas into motion. This puzzling dilemma isn't just about your efforts being blocked; your current lack of confidence makes you wonder if you will reach your goals if you are opposed to the prevailing currents. Actually, it's smarter to wait for the storm to pass; enjoy yourself today by being creative, instead of productive. Save your strength for another day when you can make real progress."
scorpio,2014-12-30,"It's irritating if someone quickly agrees with you in word, yet continues to resist your actions. It's as if there's a split between the mental and physical universe, which can be quite frustrating to you strong-willed Scorpios. Keep in mind that you won't be able to solve this dilemma today. Instead of trying to control all the variables, simply be an objective witness to the current events. Thankfully, making a conscious decision to let go of your need to fix everything can bring you peace of mind."
sagittarius,2014-12-30,"You might not be able to accomplish all your goals today, but a large part of the problem comes from extending your reach too far. You can visualize the big picture so well that it motivates you to dream beyond your immediate environment. Unfortunately, there isn't a fast way to get to your destination. Nevertheless, concentrating on the most practical things on your plate makes the most sense, even if that means success is delayed another day. Less is more if you really want to get things done."
capricorn,2014-12-30,"Your friends think you would benefit from some relaxation today but they might also secretly believe that you don't know how to have fun. However, you're more than willing to let them follow you around so you can prove them wrong. Don't bother defending your actions if someone doesn't like your plans. Do whatever you want without worrying about anyone else's opinion. Follow your bliss and see who comes along for the ride."
aquarius,2014-12-30,"The same events that would have rattled your cage previously don't seem to have much of an unsettling effect now; nevertheless, they can sidetrack your current progress. Whether you like it or not, you have some work to do because unaddressed issues won't likely vanish on their own. Make a commitment to yourself to get to the bottom of your emotional dilemma while you have such a positive attitude about life. Once you handle the situation, you can refocus on your  goals. Visualizing the finish line gets you there sooner than you expect."
pisces,2014-12-30,"You are ready to settle into an easy day at work, hoping that you don't have to deal with any major upheavals. However, you may need to climb a few hills that now stand between you and your personal satisfaction. But you won't find any pleasure if you try to force your position onto others. It's currently more effective to step back from potential conflicts until you're able to talk about your emotions in a rational manner. Taking the high road leads to a happy ending."
aries,2014-12-31,"You may be known for your ability to act spontaneously rather than planning ahead; nevertheless, you can also be quite patient if you want something badly enough. Although your current desires are strong, you're not in too much of a hurry now. In fact, you might even feel lazy enough today to luxuriate in the status quo. But don't get too complacent because a rising tide of enthusiasm is raising the stakes in the game. Your current creative efforts are more important than you think; embrace the future by initiating action in the present moment."
taurus,2014-12-31,"People frequently lean on you because you seem as steady as a rock. You're clear about what you want and most likely have a plan in mind as to how to get it. There's not much that can alter your course today and others seek security in the strength of your convictions. But your current stability depends on you sticking close to the facts, so don't waste brainpower attempting to solve the mysteries of the universe. Keep your life simple now and save the philosophizing and dreaming for another time."
gemini,2014-12-31,"You find an ironic kind of pleasure in being so practical now because you want everyone to acknowledge your emotional stability. You are often the one who pipes up with a witty comeback or a clever answer whether or not it has anything to do with the current conversation. However, you aren't interested in demonstrating your cerebral acrobatics today. Taking a few deep breaths is an effective delaying tactic, giving you the chance to contemplate your answers before you speak. Sometimes the best way to show others you care requires no words at all."
cancer,2014-12-31,"Although working closely with others today sounds like a good idea, participating in group activities is complicated by dynamic emotional entanglements. Your sense of loyalty to your friends and colleagues makes it tough to do anything that adds to the tension. Nevertheless, it's not helpful to anyone if you  try to avoid an uncomfortable subject. Fortunately, you can still be a team player now, even while saying what's on your mind. Breaking the silence in a gentle and compassionate manner clears the way for more constructive dialogue and stronger bonds."
leo,2014-12-31,"You could be counting your chickens before they hatch, even if you're not receiving much positive feedback today. You have temporarily stepped off the emotional roller-coaster and you're finally getting your bearings. Make use of the current calm by integrating the wild ups and downs you recently experienced rather than stirring up new excitement. Although there is great potential for this to be a day of relaxation, don't forget to buckle up; there will still be more thrills before your ride is actually over."
virgo,2014-12-31,"Your nerves may be on edge if your day doesn't unfold according to your well-conceived plans. Even if there is still time to finish your work, a nagging concern gnaws away in the back of your mind. You could work yourself into an anxious state because you can't solve all your problems at once. However, it's pointless to waste time being overly self-critical. Recognizing that you're a work in progress alleviates the pressure to be perfect. Focusing on your strengths makes all the difference in the world."
libra,2014-12-31,"You're tempted to let your colleagues know that you're annoyed when they act as if they know everything. Unfortunately, expressing your irritation probably won't improve the situation today. You could unconsciously make matters worse by provoking someone to act even more stubbornly. If a friend or coworker digs in his or her heels, remember that it's not your job to change anyone's mind. It's a smarter strategy now to work on your own issues and let your actions speak for you, instead. Lead by example and see who follows."
scorpio,2014-12-31,"Setting a steady pace while doing chores today offers you the best chance of achieving your short-term goals.

No one will fault you for your performance if your efforts are sincere and your intentions honorable."

capricorn,2014-12-31,"Although this could be an auspicious day, it might not seem out of the ordinary as you go about your business. The steadfast Taurus Moon aligns favorably with four planets in your ambitious sign, indicating that you can accomplish nearly anything you put your mind to now. However, Rome wasn't built in a day and the results of your current work may take weeks to manifest. Just give it your best effort moment by moment and the rewards will follow soon enough."
aquarius,2014-12-31,"Your peers might see you as brimming with holiday spirit today, especially if you keep the most serious issues buried deep inside.

Seize this rare opportunity and produce something special with lasting value. Your unwavering determination enables you to wow others with your accomplishments."
pisces,2014-12-31,"The temptation to escape from your obligations is difficult to resist, especially if you are looking forward to this evening's festivities.
